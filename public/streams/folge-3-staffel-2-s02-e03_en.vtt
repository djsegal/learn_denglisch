1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.120
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.560
15 executed revolutionaries
of the "Red Fortress".

4
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.680
Almost all the bodies
were bullets

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.000
from the pistols of your men.

6
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.160
I want those responsible
of the Reichswehr,

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.360
who organize the transport of the toxic gas
organize.

8
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.800
You want me to
your own people.

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.760
Their seizure of the train
creates tension.

10
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.240
That you Soviets are helping,

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.280
the Reichswehr illegally
is one thing.

12
00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.320
But that even
our head of state

13
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.200
the Versailles Treaties
ignored ...

14
00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.720
You can bring the delivery.
You know where the key is.

15
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.920
A foreman yesterday
a human foot

16
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.280
discovered in the foundation
and recovered a body.

17
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.400
The man
was obviously a priest.

18
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.400
Already identified?
- St. Joseph.

19
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.760
Get a radio by tomorrow
a radio by tomorrow.

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.920
*Shots, screeching*
Help!

21
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.360
Did you know any of them?
- That's not the point.

22
00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.520
Come with me.
- I have to work.

23
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.680
But then also tell
at home with the murderers,

24
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.200
what you have seen.

25
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:21.680
*exciting music*

26
00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.800
*driving, ticking music*

27
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.520
(Trochin, telephone) Commissioner Rath,
I have the papers.

28
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.720
In one hour,
Friedrichstraße S-Bahn station.

29
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.520
(Henning?
- What?

30
00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.560
Everything all right?

31
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.920
Yes.

32
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.320
I'm just asking.
- Oh, my!

33
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.000
*exciting music*

34
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.560
Well, do you want something?
Go on.

35
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.800
One mark for wringing out,
Canal wash two.

36
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.520
Get out of here.

37
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.400
Come on.
Schokostube 1.50.

38
00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.600
Get lost, boy!

39
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.280
He can't do anything.

40
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.760
With me you can
everything for a mark.

41
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
This is mine!

42
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.680
If you don't want to go to jail,
then get out.

43
00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.720
Are you a cop?
Move out!

44
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.560
(shouts) A cop!
- Vice cop!

45
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:34.960
*whistle*
Cops!

46
00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.680
Come on, get lost!

47
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.280
*exciting music*

48
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.440
*Honk*

49
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.840
What is that?

50
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.360
A visa application.
Not just any visa application.

51
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.880
There are several dozen of them.
For this man alone, Major Beck.

52
00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.480
I know him.

53
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.280
Then you probably know this one
probably know this one too.

54
00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.840
Seegers.

55
00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.680
What is going on here?

56
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.360
First you let
my men go.

57
00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.800
Then you will get evidence
against your general staff.

58
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.920
15 pieces.

59
00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.400
Do ut des.
"I give so that you may give."

60
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.240
Let's go!

61
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.800
Get out, gentlemen!

62
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:02.920
*Russian murmur*

63
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.360
Ah, finally.

64
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:06.480
*He groans.

65
00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.720
With these documents
you can prove,

66
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:24.680
that since 1925 these officers
with great regularity

67
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.800
a small village 300 km south-east of
southeast of Moscow.

68
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.880
Lipetsk, the secret base of the
of the German air force.

69
00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.480
Since the end of the war
German air force.

70
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.520
There is one in Lipetsk.

71
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.760
I don't understand you.

72
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.400
You are working
against your own country.

73
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.800
I work FOR the police.

74
00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.640
*uncanny music

75
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.200
*rhythmic music

76
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.640
*Noise

77
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.240
*bleep*

78
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.920
(Dr. Schmidt) ... the analysis of a patient
patient as something,

79
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:19.920
that follows similar mechanisms
as this radio program.

80
00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.440
In both cases, transference
and counter-transference takes place.

81
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.560
In the case of our work
with traumatized frontline soldiers

82
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:32.000
i.e. a transference
of therapist and patient.

83
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.280
The processes of our brain
work ...

84
00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.640
according to the principles
of electrophysiology.

85
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:42.000
They are nothing more
than electric currents,

86
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:45.120
the human brain
and thus the, ...

87
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.200
what we call our consciousness,
signal an activity.

88
00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.680
But why?
I ask myself, ...

89
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:58.160
Why shouldn't thoughts
between ...

90
00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:02.120
two people
separated people ...

91
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.320
be transferred as a result,

92
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.840
that the one in thought, as it were
transmits radio waves and ...

93
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.280
the other receives it
receives it directly

94
00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.240
and then
identified as his own?

95
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.480
Please note
this procedure as a suggestive ...

96
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.840
Therapy.

97
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.280
*Clacking, noise*

98
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.280
*Noise

99
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.680
*Thunder rumbling, rain pattering.

100
00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.240
There you go.

101
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.640
Thank you.

102
00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.640
What do I owe you?

103
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:56.360
Is something wrong?

104
00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.200
Nope, all good.

105
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.120
I feel
a bit florid.

106
00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:05.360
Well, get well soon.

107
00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.000
Yes, you too.

108
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.400
We can immediately
apply for the arrest warrants.

109
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:25.680
Against whom?

110
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.800
Seegers, Major Beck -
half the general staff.

111
00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:30.480
(Why?

112
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:36.800
Breach of the constitution, high treason,
Conspiracy against the Republic ...

113
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.360
Is that enough in court?
- Difficult to judge.

114
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.760
If anyone can judge that,
it must be you, Mr. Public Prosecutor.

115
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.760
They bring 13 wagons of phosgene
to Berlin.

116
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.200
And not even a year after Hamburg.
What was in Hamburg?

117
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.280
Stoltzenberg chemical works.

118
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:56.880
A valve burst on a tank wagon
a valve burst and phosgene oozed out.

119
00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.120
There were ten fatalities,
hundreds seriously injured.

120
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.200
People went outside
and just fell over.

121
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.400
And who was the gas for?
Well, guess who.

122
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.920
The Reichswehr.
Well ...

123
00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:12.280
Not officially.
There were no consequences?

124
00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.320
The chemical plant has sunk the remaining
boilers into the sea.

125
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:19.160
All this shows
that we need more,

126
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.240
if we want to take action against these people
want to take action against these people.

127
00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:24.360
These documents prove it,

128
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:28.480
that there is a German base
in the Soviet Union,

129
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.320
where German pilots are trained as
are trained as fighter pilots.

130
00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.400
In German fighter planes.

131
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.920
Where should that be?
Lipetsk.

132
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.520
That is 300 kilometers
southeast of Moscow.

133
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:44.960
And what do the Russians gain from
from helping us break the treaty?

134
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.440
(Benda) You want to build
build aircraft engines

135
00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.320
and learn that
from German engineers.

136
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.400
How big is
is this squadron?

137
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:57.360
In the end, there are only
a handful of machines.

138
00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.760
The informant says
that there are many more.

139
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.680
The documents
do not prove this.

140
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.520
You suggest it, but ...
- Mr. Public Prosecutor, please!

141
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.600
What else do you need?
- Witnesses, files, photographs.

142
00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.920
I'll do it.
(What?

143
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.920
I'm going there.
 Nonsense.

144
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.960
You're on the road for a week.
And nobody lets you in.

145
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.480
Then he'll fly.
What?

146
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.720
Well, it's quite simple.

147
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.720
You get us an airplane
and we'll get the evidence.

148
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.280
Doris.
Lottchen, you have to save me.

149
00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.720
What is it?
Invoices from a clothing factory.

150
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.720
Every single sock is
is listed,

151
00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.160
every official textile
of the police since 1924.

152
00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:54.000
And now I'm supposed to
check everything.

153
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:56.320
That's at least 400 pages.

154
00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:59.600
But that's great.
You sit on it for days.

155
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.400
I can't do math.
You have to help me.

156
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.920
Just like you!
80 pfennigs an hour.

157
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.360
What exactly do you have to do?
You do it?

158
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.200
Again.
There's no such thing.

159
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.240
Write uff.

160
00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:22.920
Delivery bill 219/27.
To Spandau town hall.

161
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:27.400
46 Office window curtains
Acceptance and cleaning.

162
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:29.400
And here, four days later:

163
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.960
Invoicing
460 Office window curtains,

164
00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.440
Removal and cleaning at nine marks.

165
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:37.320
Makes 4140 marks.

166
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.160
That means,
they charge ten times as much!

167
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.920
I'd say they're pretty cheeky, the
pretty cheeky, the Sklarek brothers.

168
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.720
I would say that too.

169
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600
*There's a knock.

170
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.120
No!

171
00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.360
(sighs) What does it say out there?

172
00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.240
Oh, Commissioner ...

173
00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.520
Is everything destroyed now?
No.

174
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.840
Yes, it is.

175
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.440
Sorry.

176
00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.320
Two questions, Mr. Gräf.

177
00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.400
Firstly, where is Jänicke?

178
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.240
Not published today.

179
00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:15.280
We even had a date
at the "Aschinger".

180
00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.880
And the second question?

181
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:23.520
Have you ever
ever sat in an airplane?

182
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.760
What's up?

183
00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.400
These are documents,

184
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:33.480
which the Chief Constable
for examination ...

185
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:35.520
I'll look at it later.

186
00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.840
There are payments,
irregularities ...

187
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.360
Have it paid out.
I'll look at it later.

188
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:44.480
You can leave now.

189
00:13:58.920 --> 00:13:59.960
Boo!

190
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.520
Fritz, you scared me!

191
00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.960
I'm sorry.

192
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.440
Why are you doing this?

193
00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:07.800
Oh, come on!

194
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.240
Wait a minute.

195
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.520
What then?

196
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:15.280
What you said,
at the funeral procession.

197
00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:17.960
Mr. Benda is not a murderer.

198
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.280
Oh, Mr. Benda ...
He's so nice to you, isn't he?

199
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.440
No, but he has a good heart.
I know that.

200
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.720
Gretchen, maybe he has it.

201
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.640
But he is also
the head of political affairs.

202
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:34.880
And he has to leave his good heart
outside the office in the checkroom.

203
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:36.760
And he picks it up in the evening.

204
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.400
And in the meantime he lets
slaughter us communists.

205
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.000
*exciting music*

206
00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.800
*exciting music*

207
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.840
*exciting music*

208
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.360
Moritz!

209
00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:25.480
Senior?

210
00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.160
What are you doing there?

211
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.000
Nothing.

212
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.440
Where did you get the key?

213
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.720
You can't just
just spy around.

214
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.240
I didn't either.

215
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.400
You immediately lock up again
and hang the key there,

216
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.840
where you got it from.

217
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:44.760
Where is your mother?

218
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.280
Shopping with Mrs. Wolter.

219
00:16:49.520 --> 00:16:50.680
March off!

220
00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.000
*The projection machine rattles,
laughter, murmuring*.

221
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:08.000
There's another one up ahead.

222
00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.400
*lively piano music

223
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.520
(whispers)
Communists kiss chambermaids.

224
00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:26.760
And then the hairdressers.
And four tailors.

225
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.320
And beauty advice.
- Can I have the sausage, please?

226
00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.920
And it costs nothing,
We have tried everything.

227
00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.680
There were two jewelers
with long, glass counters.

228
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.920
And upstairs in the second
was a fashion show.

229
00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.800
In the middle of the ladies' department.
So beautiful!

230
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.840
"Dernier Cri".
That means: the latest craze.

231
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:48.360
From Paris for Madame.

232
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.400
Oh, if I were 20
and had money ...

233
00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:54.840
You don't look 50 and without money
and without money, Helga.

234
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:57.600
Cheers!
 Cheers!

235
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.440
Cheers.
Oh God, empty again.

236
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.960
(Cheers.

237
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:15.120
Has it gotten worse?

238
00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:17.640
Anders.

239
00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:18.920
Worse?

240
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:21.400
No, just different.

241
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:23.640
*distant barking*

242
00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:32.320
((Anno) Gereon!)

243
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:33.600
*(neighing)*

244
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:38.480
*distant barking*

245
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:42.920
Can you help me, please?

246
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.280
Gereon ...

247
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.840
He no longer stands
between us.

248
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.920
*exciting music*

249
00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.320
*tick*

250
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:20.800
*He exhales deeply.

251
00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:31.400
*dark music*

252
00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.560
*fast, rhythmic music*

253
00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.280
*He breathes frantically.

254
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:08.480
Moritz.

255
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.800
The most modern thing
that can fly today.

256
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.320
First model.

257
00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.400
You're lucky,
that it's in Berlin.

258
00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:43.560
It should actually
do a test flight,

259
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.560
from Hamburg to Lisbon.

260
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.920
What came in between?
- A crash landing.

261
00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:58.480
Well, an emergency landing.
Something new needs to be tested.

262
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.520
Do you know your way around?

263
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.480
No.
 No.

264
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:08.840
Never opened a parachute before?
- You're flying for the first time.

265
00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:12.800
The police chief said,
professionals are coming.

266
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.360
Professional ... Police officers.

267
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.280
Never flown before?

268
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.560
No.
 No.

269
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.120
Gentlemen, your pilot:
Siegfried Stoltz.

270
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.400
Man with combat experience,
tested over long distances.

271
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.800
And his navigator Robert Sauer.

272
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:39.920
Rath.
Sour.

273
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.280
Pride.
- Count.

274
00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:43.160
How do you do? Sour.
- Count.

275
00:23:43.400 --> 00:23:44.600
How do you do?

276
00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:48.400
Are you oriented?
- We have the coordinates.

277
00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:51.760
It's quite a belt
without a stopover.

278
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.480
But you can do it?

279
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.680
It will work out.

280
00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.800
Soldiers?

281
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.120
Good luck.

282
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.720
Make yourself comfortable.

283
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.760
(laughs)
It's a transport plane.

284
00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.600
You can't install
install seats here overnight. Please.

285
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.120
Seen the folding device?

286
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:53.560
Will be a one-a-bomber,
when we're allowed to again.

287
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.200
Small assembly
and ready to drop.

288
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.840
Which airplane has
so much storage space for supplies?

289
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:02.200
Oh yes ...

290
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:10.520
Stand between the legs,
take aim down the hill.

291
00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:16.200
Fire cock open.
- That's right.

292
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.760
mixture.

293
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.440
*rattling engine*

294
00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:56.800
*engine noise

295
00:25:57.720 --> 00:25:58.720
*chatter*

296
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.160
*He groans.

297
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.000
Devil!

298
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.640
Man! A great piece!

299
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.400
The joystick
sometimes sticks a bit.

300
00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.400
So don't be surprised,
happens from time to time.

301
00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.680
*He chokes.

302
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.240
Hh!

303
00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:46.880
*quiet music

304
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:11.120
(Benda) Minister Stresemann,
we have information,

305
00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.360
that certain circles
are planning to assassinate you.

306
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.320
Very soon.
- Communists?

307
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.160
National forces.

308
00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.520
How many attempts on my life

309
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.640
have you and your men
prevented in recent years?

310
00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:28.760
Ten? Twenty?

311
00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:31.920
Twelve, to be precise.

312
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:34.680
Then do as you always do.

313
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:39.320
Your men save my life,
I save the peace,

314
00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:43.520
and one day we die
comfortably in the bathtub.

315
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:45.880
The state visit at the time ...

316
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.840
Foreign Minister Briand?

317
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:54.680
We have indications of a
a significant change in the security situation.

318
00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:58.960
A change in the situation doesn't upset me
doesn't upset me, Benda.

319
00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.000
I simply love my life
simply too little.

320
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:06.920
But what worries me is this,
what you have brought me here.

321
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.920
Are you aware of this?

322
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.640
The entire Reichstag
knows about it.

323
00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:13.680
But these dimensions ...

324
00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.480
With this we are bringing
half the general staff to court.

325
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.160
Please don't do that!

326
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:22.400
You think everyone in the Reichstag
everyone is quite happy,

327
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.840
that the Russians are helping us,

328
00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.960
a modern air force
to build up?

329
00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.320
Not you?

330
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.360
Mr. Foreign Minister, I know
that you have signed the Treaty of Versailles

331
00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:43.120
always seen as a dishonor to Germany
Germany.

332
00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:48.600
But you won the Nobel Prize
for a peace agreement.

333
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:52.160
My peace mediation
is aimed solely at this,

334
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.800
that new agreements are not
on our moral humiliation

335
00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.840
and economic subjugation
are based on.

336
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:02.840
It bothers me
that you are so sure.

337
00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:06.880
Things are complex
in the German Reich, always have been.

338
00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.280
No doubt about it.

339
00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:12.400
But what do you say?
when the League of Nations hears about it,

340
00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.200
that Lipetsk is not a training camp
for a few hotshots,

341
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.240
but that a new
German air force being created there?

342
00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:21.680
*There's a knock.

343
00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.400
*He groans.

344
00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.520
Excuse me
again briefly.

345
00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.280
If my Käte came in now,
then mercy on the bearded man.

346
00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:37.920
Go on, Benda.

347
00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.680
I have fewer secrets from Dr. Koller
secrets than I do from my wife.

348
00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.480
We have a freight train
with poison gas,

349
00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:50.560
from which you can easily produce
100,000 grenades.

350
00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.680
More recent estimates
on troop strength

351
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:58.760
of the shadow army of the Reichswehr
are in the six-figure range.

352
00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.280
Now of all times,
when the French are guests.

353
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.360
When the French Foreign Minister
gets wind of the dimensions,

354
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.440
I look like a fraud.

355
00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:12.960
Recommend me for now.
- Thank you, Patachon.

356
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:15.160
Take care, Pat.
- To order.

357
00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:25.240
What do you suggest?

358
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:32.960
It's only a matter of time
until this thing makes waves.

359
00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:36.400
And then you should
not look like a fraud,

360
00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:38.680
but to look like an enlightener.

361
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:43.120
Please continue.

362
00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.840
I'm just now getting
the latest evidence.

363
00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:48.240
In Russia.

364
00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:52.320
And then we bring the gang
in court in Germany.

365
00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.720
Who exactly do you mean?

366
00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.760
Seegers, Ludendorff ...
just the tips.

367
00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.640
You obviously love your life
even less than I do.

368
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.680
A leyb hot nit

369
00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:09.920
"The lion fears no fly."

370
00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.520
I know, Benda.
That's what my wife always says.

371

(Engelbert Rath) Gereon.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.920
Now they want us to believe that
people are all the same).

00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.560
*He laughs.

375
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.440
(Another major error of modern times.

376
00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.720
Man is imperfect.

377
00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:11.280
The mob a danger.
Capital is full of temptations.

378
00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.800
We are all sinners.

379
00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:18.240
Only in this are we the same.

380
00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:22.640
Physically and mentally
we are unequal.

381
00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.760
That is God-given.

382
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.240
Take your brother Anno.

383
00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.560
You must never succumb to error,

384
00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.440
to strive for the same goals
as he does.

385
00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.400
People differ
most clearly

386
00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.440
in their ability to lead.

387
00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:46.520
Those who do not have the humility
to recognize this,

388
00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:50.560
should not make any claims to power
at all.

389
00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.400
In the state we find ...

390
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.560
to our true humanity.

391
00:33:56.800 --> 00:33:59.000
A divine world order ...

392
00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.880
is only reflected
reflected in society,

393
00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:05.720
which allows a structured state

*The voice gets quieter and quieter.

395
00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:13.400
(Hierarchy is anchored in the divine
origin of the state).

*dramatic piano music*

397
00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:28.800
Why did you leave me?

398
00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.800
Helga.

399
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.800
Why?
- Tell me.

400
00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:42.720
Why did you leave me?

401
00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:44.680
Say it.

402
00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:49.640
Why?

403
00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:55.000
I have fallen in love
in love with your brother.

404
00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.720
And now?

405
00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:02.240
You have to decide.

406
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.960
I have made up my mind.

407
00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.800
Helga!

408
00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:23.720
Helga!

409
00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.760
*thunder roll

410
00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.840
*dramatic music*

411
00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.880
(Engelbert Rath)
God has abandoned us. For a long time.

412
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.760
And what remains?

413
00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:52.120
A fuselage.

414
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.520
A tree without roots.

415
00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.240
A world without light.

416
00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.640
First the false son returns home.

417
00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:08.240
Then you leave me alone with him.)

418
00:36:24.880 --> 00:36:26.120
Father.

419
00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:50.680
That was just missing today.

420
00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.760
We are very close
to the coordinates.

421
00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.560
But the bad weather
makes it difficult.

422
00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:22.800
What?

423
00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:26.240
Navigating.
We go below the clouds!

424
00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:36.960
*Engine noises fade away.

425
00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:51.760
What happened?

426
00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.200
We got caught.

427
00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.840
Ignition.

428
00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:00.000
*Motor rattles.

429
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.800
Nothing.

430
00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:05.880
Ignite again.

431
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.320
Nothing again.

432
00:38:13.520 --> 00:38:16.440
Go steeper.
The propellers block ...

433
00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.760
*loud hiss*

434
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.560
Okay, ignite.

435
00:38:27.800 --> 00:38:28.800
Ignition.

436
00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:35.920
*Engine rattles.

437
00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.520
(co-pilot) There! Right in front of us!

438
00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:49.640
The goal!

439
00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:56.160
Yes, that must be it.

440
00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:01.800
But shouldn't we
keep our distance?

441
00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:04.280
Yes, sure.
But you want to take pictures.

442
00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:07.880
Now, man! Good view!
- We can't get any closer.

443
00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.440
Come on!

444
00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.640
You lie down
and your colleague holds you.

445
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:33.960
Do not forget to hold on tight.

446
00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:37.760
Come on!

447
00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.600
Come on, don't worry!

448
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:27.800
Pull me in.
I have to change the movie.

449
00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:31.520
*Rockets fizzle.

450
00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:39.920
Ah!

451
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.120
Your hand!

452
00:40:51.920 --> 00:40:52.920
Come on!

453
00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:26.400
As long as the clouds stay thick,
we are safe.

454
00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:40.400
I'm temporarily changing course.
Better safe than sorry.
