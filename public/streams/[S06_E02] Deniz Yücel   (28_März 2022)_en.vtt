00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.960
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.400
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.760
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.560
* light groan *

6
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.920
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.800
Deniz Yücel,
48 years old, WELT journalist,

8
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560
President
of the German PEN Center,

9
00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.600
convicted terror propagandist
and one year in jail under Erdogan.

10
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.000
Mr. Yücel?
Yes?

11
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.720
Now I have ... You know what?
I forgot the suitcase.

12
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.960
I always have
Turkish hand water.

13
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.120
* Yücel laughs. *
I just thought of that.

14
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.320
You are the guest, that would
fit like a glove.

15
00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.080
You don't have it there, do you?
No. - Oh ...

16
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.640
I co... I'm coming in.
Okay.

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.000
So, the questions are in.

18
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.520
So, moin.
Hi.

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.360
How do we do this now?
I don't know, very formally?

20
00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.360
Good evening. - The first time
that I shake hands with a guest.

21
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.160
We had the plague on our asses.
* (CLEARS THROAT)

22
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.600
Yes, but at some point
it's time to call it a day.

23
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.280
Do you want to ... We don't know each other,
have never met.

24
00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.920
Are we on a first name basis?

25
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.040
As you like.
After all, we're both star journalists.

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.160
Then we'll stick with the you.

27
00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.720
Here we are ... because connected
through journalism.

28
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.040
I think it's silly
when people are really on a first-name basis

29
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.840
and then hold it in interviews
keep it in the you form.

30
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.240
So we're on a first-name basis?
Yes, with pleasure.

31
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.440
Do you want ... Do you want ...
Do you want a drink?

32
00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.200
I'll take a water.

33
00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.600
I do not know what the play of colors
has on itself.

34
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.760
Thank you.

35
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.200
After all, we are not allowed to advertise.

36
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.600
So ...

37
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.280
You might ask the first question:
"Tell me, are you smoking again?"

38
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.720
No, can you smoke here?
Then I'd go for it.

39
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.160
Well, I'm allowed to smoke,
because I'm a fictional character.

40
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.920
After all, I do not exist.

41
00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.240
I'm allowed to.

42
00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.320
Okay, now let's get started.

43
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.640
Mr. Yücel, you are a
convicted terror propagandist

44
00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.560
and Erdogan
called you agent terrorist.

45
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.600
What is an agent terrorist?

46
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.120
Oh God, the story
I have already told it several times.

47
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.920
So often that I really
really can't hear anymore, sorry.

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.520
You should not listen to them
listen to them either.

49
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.440
Yes, but I can say why.
That was Chez Krömer with Deniz Yücel.

50
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.520
Thank you, let's
go out. - Nah, wait a minute.

51
00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.960
Well, I'd like to finish the ...
Come on, we'll end the show now.

52
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.840
Alright.

53
00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.080
So, there was something for everyone.

54
00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.920
Uh... Mr. Yücel, we have ...
There was a cut.

55
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.240
We have
sat here for three hours.

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.840
He simply does not
with the language out.

57
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.120
How did you like it?
Oh, super show.

58
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.680
But you didn't want to hear
why I don't want to talk about it?

59
00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.200
I have a few more questions.
Can we not do it this way?

60
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.840
You answered my questions
and say at the next one,

61
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.400
when Plasberg or Maischberger
calls: "Have you still got it?

62
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.320
I talked about that with Krömer
the last time!"

63
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.800
No, I have already said that.

64
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.560
Why don't you say it again?
No, I don't want to.

65
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.680
You know, over and over again
telling this story ...

66
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.600
You've been in the business for 25 ...
Just listen.

67
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.480
For 30 years ...
I'm about to tell you something.

68
00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.480
Now I'm telling.
Just listen.

69
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.400
You didn't wait.

70
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.800
No, because I want
want answers to my questions.

71
00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:53.600
No, we could
lead directly to the present.

72
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.640
We could talk about today.

73
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.640
For 30 years I've been talking
about my fucking name.

74
00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.840
This Alexander Bojcan thing,
Kurt Krömer... for 30 years.

75
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.920
Now again,
all the time.

76
00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:09.720
I explain, stupid as I am,
the same story over and over again.

77
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.200
I can't help that.
Can I...

78
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.800
I can say:
I'm not talking about that?

79
00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.840
I can tell you why.
Then... - Let me tell.

80
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.920
Were we on a first-name basis?
I think so.

81
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:27.240
We can go back to the you.
I'll be ready in a moment.

82
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.280
There are two people in my life,

83
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.080
from which I have formally
have withdrawn the you.

84
00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.160
Yes, who?
Jürgen Elsässer was one. - Oh.

85
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.680
Well, I would ...
What did you have to do with Elsässer?

86
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.240
Interview?
No, at Jungle World and so on.

87
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.280
Oh, that's right. The guy
wasn't always enchanted.

88
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.560
He was always a little weird,
but we knew each other once.

89
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.680
The other was Ozan Ceyhun,

90
00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.040
once a member of the European Parliament
of the Green Party from Rüsselsheim,

91
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.360
where I also come from ...
Near Frankfurt.

92
00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.240
Exactly. In the meantime he is
Erdogan's ambassador in Vienna.

93
00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.280
Now you have said the name yourself
name yourself. - You would be the third.

94
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.480
You would be the third.
Come on, let's go back inside.

95
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:13.480
(laughs) Good. - You realize,
it's a strict regime here.

96
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.240
Yes. - You'll be kicked out, too.
I can kick you out too.

97
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.200
I don't have a thing
with authoritarian regimes.

98
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.840
Yes, but still.

99
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.280
Let me tell you
what my problem is.

100
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.200
No, I'm asking the questions.

101
00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.640
All right, ask the questions. - That is
the problem with journalists.

102
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.560
You are not here today
for you to ask questions.

103
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.200
You don't ask one question here.
Now come on, time is running out.

104
00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:38.720
Yes, it's five to twelve.

105
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.880
It is alleged that prior to your
There was an arms deal before your release

106
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.200
between Germany and Turkey.

107
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.400
Oh no. The Turkish side tried to do that
side tried, like so many things.

108
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.920
The then
Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel

109
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.720
also held out the prospect of this.

110
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.520
I said from jail,
I refuse to make dirty deals.

111
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.240
But again:
To go back again,

112
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.800
this story
again,

113
00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.560
means for me ...

114
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.240
In prison I always wanted my
freedom back and normality.

115
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.200
I also wanted to continue working
correspondent in Istanbul.

116
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.760
To tell this story again and again
Telling it, getting into details,

117
00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.160
means, again and again
this label of the journalist,

118
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.200
who sat in the dungeon of the caliph,
to drag around with you.

119
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.840
I do not want that.

120
00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.280
I was on a talk show to tell the
to tell and then again,

121
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.040
when I told it in my book,
which was not just a memoir,

122
00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.680
"agent terrorist," but for which
I have researched.

123
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.600
Among other things, what was going on with arms deals,
what the Turkish side wanted,

124
00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.520
which role
Gerhard Schröder played.

125
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.440
He mediated.
Yes, at a very important point.

126
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.320
In the summer there was the escalation,

127
00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.720
where after me the German human rights activist
Peter Steudtner was arrested.

128
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.520
There was this terror list,
German companies,

129
00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.360
Spätis and kebab stores,
but also BASF and Daimler

130
00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.320
appeared on a
Turkish terror list.

131
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.840
Gabriel then interrupted his
his vacation, came to Berlin,

132
00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.760
declared a reorientation
of the Turkey policy.

133
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:17.240
It was an escalation and
between the two went nothing more.

134
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.480
Then Gabriel came up with the idea,

135
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.600
his old buddy from
days together in Lower Saxony,

136
00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.600
Gerhard Schröder,
to ask him if he wouldn't...

137
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.280
can break the ice,
to put it this way.

138
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.280
Schröder let it be known, he does,

139
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:36.720
but he needs
the approval of the German Chancellor.

140
00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.880
But Erdogan saw
the reactions from Germany

141
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.880
were much stronger
than he thought.

142
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.880
Did he know you were known,

143
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.440
that one asks oneself
wonder after a few days:

144
00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.080
"Say,
Deniz doesn't call anymore"?

145
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.520
Whether he knew that beforehand,
I do not know.

146
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.160
But when I was in jail,

147
00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:57.680
he said in the ZEIT interview: "The
Germans have gone completely mad.

148
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.160
They get up, say Deniz,
go to sleep, say Deniz."

149
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.920
But this has awakened in him
awakened desires in him.

150
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.880
He thought, if he's so important,
I want to have something for him,

151
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.040
then I will not let him
not run for nothing.

152
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.680
That's what makes gangsters tick.

153
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.640
And he then wanted any ...

154
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.920
suspected coup plotters or other
supporters of the Gülen organization,

155
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.840
who had fled to Germany,
in exchange.

156
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.240
The conversation between the two was:

157
00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:29.480
Schröder said:
"Even I couldn't do that,

158
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:32.920
just replace them,
if I were chancellor."

159
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.400
To which Erdogan says, "How,
not even you could do that?"

160
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.080
That convinced him. - And is ...
That did not go immediately afterwards ...

161
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.880
Can I make inquiries?
Are inquiries allowed?

162
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.040
Of course, if I may
to the end.

163
00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.680
This was not the end of the story,
but it was a turning point.

164
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:51.760
And ... I would ask now.

165
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.880
Is it a nice feeling,

166
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.880
in the year 2022
To be grateful to Gerhard Schröder?

167
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.760
He made himself useful there.

168
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:08.960
After my release
sometime after my release,

169
00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.960
that he expects my thanks.

170
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.680
Did he say?
He told me.

171
00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:19.000
That you jump out of the cake
in suspenders jumping out of the cake?

172
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
No, he let me know ...

173
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.360
Will you take my cigarettes now?
Yes.

174
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.160
Well, you may.
I'm just not allowed to offer.

175
00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.040
I'm not allowed to offer, but he ...
After all, you didn't offer it to me.

176
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.200
And ...
We make you such a ...

177
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.120
Pixel.
That's what I did then, in writing.

178
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:41.920
I also thanked
thanked Angela Merkel.

179
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.480
The fact that I have been able to thank Angela Merkel,
Sigmar Gabriel

180
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:48.080
and many others,

181
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:51.400
does not mean
that I can't criticize them.

182
00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:55.240
Can we bring forward,
the MAZ with the motorcade?

183
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.320
Did you...
We'll look at that first.

184
00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.760
Free Deniz:
For the journalist Yücel

185
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.480
demonstrate
Friends and sympathizers.

186
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.320
Around 50 vehicles set
on the move in the early noon

187
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:13.000
Direction Turkish Embassy
in Tiergarten.

188
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:17.120
Did you catch that?

189
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.400
After or during?
Not during.

190
00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.400
Pictures less, but newspaper yes.
Mhm.

191
00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:26.920
Tell me,
in Russia it's like this:

192
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:31.360
If you now, as a journalist
you mention the name war,

193
00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:34.480
you will be
put in prison for 15 years.

194
00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.400
Would you go to Russia
and say "war"?

195
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.840
I think that applies first of all to
the few Russian journalists.

196
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.240
And the Germans? - There are hardly
foreign journalists left.

197
00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.880
First they were pulled off,

198
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.800
now they are allowed to report,
but no one says war.

199
00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.200
Well, authoritarian regimes are like that.
But do you find ...

200
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.240
If I am a Russia correspondent,
what am I supposed to report on now?

201
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.320
Should I make a cooking show

202
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.240
or report,
that it's spring in Russia?

203
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.520
So the correspondent of WELT-TV,
Christoph Wanner,

204
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:17.440
is still in Moscow,
As of now, mid-March.

205
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.280
He says "war", of course, and
continues the reporting,

206
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.160
for which I have great respect.

207
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.800
In Ukraine
this man was spotted.

208
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:34.800
Does Springer have nothing better
than an obese hamster?

209
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.440
So what a crock of shit, really.

210
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:40.680
This self-righteous bullshit
of public law,

211
00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.680
who is also paid from his fees
is paid.

212
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.120
Now we're getting into the swing of things.
This is really dull.

213
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.400
Paul Ronzheimer is doing
a super job in Ukraine.

214
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.560
It was after the fire
of the refugee camp on Lesbos

215
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:56.120
to my knowledge, the first
German journalist who was there.

216
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.760
This is really breakdown
and uncooperative.

217
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:05.080
This is here before the ...
Paul is not the only one.

218
00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.600
Katrin Eigendorf from ZDF is also doing a great
a great job in Ukraine.

219
00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:13.480
I was in Afghanistan.
These jokes are really ...

220
00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:16.760
When I was in Afghanistan
the BILD called and asked,

221
00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.560
whether I can stand on a tank with a machine gun
can stand on a tank.

222
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:23.040
I don't know,
but that's a real glitch.

223
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.560
That's self-righteous bullshit
and it's uncollegial.

224
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:31.680
Because this is my colleague?

225
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:35.280
Because the man is
is at the front.

226
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:39.280
He is at war,
in Kiev, which is bombed.

227
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:42.600
Now here to make these jokes,
is really...

228
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:44.320
I find that uncomfortable.

229
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.560
I still have to think about it.
Yes, go ahead.

230
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.040
You can cut it out. - No.
Are you afraid we'll cut?

231
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.360
No.
How much do we have? 15:21 min.

232
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.960
Do we want to do live on tape?
Yes, of course.

233
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:03.960
When do we have to stop? 28...
(28:30.

234
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.240
Oh come on, we'll stop at 28:30.

235
00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:08.760
No,
we don't have to cut anything out.

236
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:15.120
I thought maybe it would make you
to think and is unpleasant for you.

237
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:18.880
I'll leave it in and call you
then call you to see if I was uncomfortable.

238
00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:21.480
But we'll leave everything in, okay?
As you like.

239
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.360
Many people are afraid
that something will be cut out ...

240
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:29.920
No, that was not my fear.
That was an offer.

241
00:13:30.360 --> 00:13:33.760
Yes.
embarrassed, we won't.

242
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.920
We leave it.
* Yücel laughs. *

243
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:38.760
But we do live on tape, right?
Yes, of course.

244
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:42.600
Turkey now also wants

245
00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.520
play a mediating role
in the Ukraine war.

246
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.960
Is Erdogan a peacemaker now?
Great idea, isn't it? - What does ...

247
00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:54.880
A criminal autocrat
try, thereby ...

248
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:59.680
by upgrading another criminal autocrat.
criminal autocrat.

249
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:01.720
But what ...

250
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:05.960
Let me look inside that head.
How does he imagine it?

251
00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.680
Who now, Erdogan?
Yes.

252
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.520
Well, Erdogan ...
What does he want to be seen as?

253
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.400
Erdogan has thrown himself at Putin in recent years.
Putin in recent years,

254
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:18.160
but maintains a certain distance
by, for example, the combat drones,

255
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.040
manufactured by his son-in-law
Bayraktar combat drones,

256
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.280
supplied to Ukraine,

257
00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.000
who have so far done more for the defense
Ukraine have done

258
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:31.680
than all the warm words
from Germany.

259
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.120
Um ... So the hero tries
to serve both sides.

260
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.440
What Erdogan is trying to do
is one thing, but the second is,

261
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:44.720
that also the federal government
appeals for its help,

262
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:49.080
as it was a few months ago
after the disaster in Afghanistan.

263
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:57.040
I find that really alarming,
that this autocrat ...

264
00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:00.720
I am not talking about human rights
violations in Turkey,

265
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.680
but its foreign policy.

266
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:07.960
One who tolerates the IS for years,
its Islamist troops

267
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:11.760
and his own army against the
against the Kurds in Syria,

268
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.320
waged war against the Armenians,
threatened against Greece,

269
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:20.240
who dreams of Jerusalem's conquest
... That is Erdogan's foreign policy.

270
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.920
To throw oneself at him now,
to stop Putin is ...

271
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.760
This is really problematic,
to put it kindly.

272
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.480
The lesson from the Ukraine war
should actually be,

273
00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.920
that this whole approach ...

274
00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:40.960
The answers must be faster
otherwise we will have to cut.

275
00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.600
At 28:30 I run out.

276
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.200
It would be faster if you didn't
would interfere.

277
00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.160
Then it's a monologue.

278
00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.840
I can go home
and you keep talking.

279
00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.280
I just wanted to finish
to finish this sentence.

280
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:58.640
That should be the lesson
from the war in Ukraine,

281
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:01.840
that one
you don't cuddle with autocrats.

282
00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.480
Do we understand that now?

283
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.200
Because Ukraine conflict is since 2014.

284
00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.520
Everybody's acting
as if it's only been a few weeks.

285
00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.080
Do you think we'll get it?
I'm afraid not.

286
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:19.320
Otherwise we would not be
throwing ourselves at Erdogan.

287
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.120
(sighs) To the next question.
Come to the next question.

288
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.200
We have only 10 minutes left.

289
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.080
Russia was
excluded from the book fair.

290
00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.920
As president of the German
PEN Center, you argue against it,

291
00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.120
Russian authors
and authors to be excluded.

292
00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:41.600
I found the decision of the book fair
interesting and correct.

293
00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:45.760
They did not say they exclude all
Russian authors and publishers,

294
00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:51.160
but this state
of the Russian state.

295
00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.840
Otherwise, they want to take a close
publishers to look closely.

296
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.680
I think that is actually
a correct approach.

297
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:01.880
I think it is right
this regime at all levels,

298
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.680
whether in culture,
in sports or wherever,

299
00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:09.040
to say: No, that is not possible, there is no
there is no such thing as an apolitical area.

300
00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:15.720
But not to hog all the Russian literature
literature into hogging,

301
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.120
not to punish authors,
Russian, Belarusian authors,

302
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.000
who have spoken out against this war
have spoken out.

303
00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.760
As PEN, we have said that the enemy
is Putin, not Pushkin.

304
00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:31.000
Good, isn't it? - Pointe.
Super. - Firecracker.

305
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.680
* Yücel laughs. *

306
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.200
Your boss Mathias Döpfner

307
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.600
has said the following about ex-BILD boss
Julian Reichelt the following:

308
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.120
"He is the last and
only journalist in Germany,

309
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:47.040
who still courageously rebels against the new
GDR authoritarian state.

310
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:50.680
Almost everyone else has
become propaganda assistants."

311
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:53.880
Who are you?
Are you a propaganda assistant?

312
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.520
He didn't say that.

313
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:00.240
He wrote this to Benjamin Stuckrad-Barre
in a private text message.

314
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.760
I think that makes a difference.

315
00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.640
Is that why he did not say it or
was what he said just made public?

316
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.480
No, there is a difference,

317
00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.200
whether someone in a private
communication is talking stupid shit

318
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.840
or makes that public.

319
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.120
But does he talk stupid shit in private?
That yes, of course.

320
00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.720
But it was private
and that is a difference.

321
00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.960
That's why it's not true.
Does he always talk shit in private?

322
00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:27.640
No, not with me.

323
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.600
Does he send you ...
That's nonsense, of course.

324
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:35.280
But it is still
a private communication.

325
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.200
The in this way
to the public,

326
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.040
I do not find clean.

327
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:43.120
Well, okay,
there are two things.

328
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.760
Making something public,
may not be nice,

329
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.440
but it is his opinion.

330
00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:52.520
How do we remain now? - I do not know
not whether that is his opinion.

331
00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.960
Was he drunk?
I don't know.

332
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.520
Why don't you invite him?
I can't tell.

333
00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.640
Can you put in a good word
for me?

334
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.640
That you say to Döpfner:
"Go to Chez Krömer,

335
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.320
who worships you and will
not ask critical questions."?

336
00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.080
But don't chicken out when he comes.
No, of course. - Okay.

337
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.240
How many times did we invite him?
Five times or so?

338
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.040
Reichelt always had to ask.

339
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.120
Now he no longer comes,
where he is out.

340
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.240
Mathias Döpfner
I'm happy to ask. - Yes.

341
00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:27.600
But say,
that we only ask good questions.

342
00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.720
Can you lie for me?

343
00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.760
Are you lying for me?
I think he can handle it.

344
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:34.880
He's not coming.
I don't know.

345
00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:38.040
When he comes,
I'll owe you one. - All right.

346
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:43.000
(sighs) You started your career at
Jungle World and the taz.

347
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.760
Were you a left-wing sock?

348
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.000
Why were? Sure.

349
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.000
Are you still?
Sure I am.

350
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.800
Are you still
at the taz or at Jungle World?

351
00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.200
No, I'm with the WORLD.

352
00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.440
At the ... Where?
At the WORLD.

353
00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:02.600
That's Springer.
Yes, and?

354
00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:05.640
WELT is Springer, isn't it?
Yes, and?

355
00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.320
How does one get there?
I was asked.

356
00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.160
But the jump is so stark.
No, not at all.

357
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.360
Couldn't you have gone to the
Süddeutsche or FAZ first,

358
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.000
where you say: okay ...

359
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.560
The decisive factor is
what comes out of it.

360
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.920
Were you just...
So the jump was ...

361
00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.320
Were you only asked by the WELT?
That was a good fit at the time.

362
00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:29.600
That was actually
a big leap,

363
00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.120
but not for me
from the taz to the WELT,

364
00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.200
but it was
my first day in Istanbul.

365
00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.520
I have never before been a correspondent
in another country.

366
00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:42.360
But you could have called anywhere
could have called and said:

367
00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:45.080
"This is Deniz Yücel,
I'll be there tomorrow at 8 a.m,

368
00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.960
I am
the correspondent in Istanbul."

369
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:52.080
They all had one.
To me, it looks as if ...

370
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:55.560
For me... - Shall I tell you a story
You want me to tell you a story from the taz?

371
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.800
No, I do not want to hear
not hear a story from the taz.

372
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:01.880
I have heard all the stories.
No, you...

373
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:04.760
Is it not the greatest blow
in the face of the taz,

374
00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.400
when you go to Springer?

375
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.200
No, I have a good relationship with the
a good relationship.

376
00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.240
Can we call and ask now?
Of course.

377
00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.160
They're off duty.

378
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.280
In prison, the taz
especially stood up for me.

379
00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:23.280
I am soon again
invited to the Taz-lab.

380
00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.680
I have a good relationship with the
a good relationship,

381
00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.200
did not go in the noise.
No? - No.

382
00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.120
Decisive for this,
where I stand politically ...

383
00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:36.440
I wasn't in the taz either ...
You broke taboos. - No.

384
00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:41.920
In a debate about political correctness
Correctness, you cause an uproar,

385
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.640
because you repeatedly
repeatedly said the N-word.

386
00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.920
This was about the question "Dealing with
historical quotations and literature".

387
00:21:51.080 --> 00:21:54.560
What was going on there?
Oh, now wait a minute.

388
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.320
Do not say that you do not answer the question
not answer the question.

389
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.960
No, you did not
you didn't wait for my answer.

390
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:04.160
Well, I'm waiting for them.
Yes, let me.

391
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.640
I was...
No, you were going to say something,

392
00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.640
that Protestant
conscience crap.

393
00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:14.440
"How can you, as a leftist, work for the
Newspaper?" That's nonsense.

394
00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.160
The basis,
on which I work for the WORLD

395
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.360
and for whom I would work everywhere else
would only work for,

396
00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.720
is the absolute autonomy
as an author.

397
00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:28.720
That does not mean that I can not
be edited ...

398
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.600
But you are still
with the question before.

399
00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.800
You did not let me
answer. So if ...

400
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:41.400
When the Belarusian dictator
Lukashenko

401
00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:45.000
people in a cynical way
used as a weapon

402
00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.920
and carted to the Polish border

403
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.280
and I write in the WORLD:
"Just let them in" ...

404
00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:52.040
That is Europe's problem,

405
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.880
that you can be blackmailed
to be blackmailed by a thousand people.

406
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.000
I do not know
what the problem is,

407
00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.760
when I write this commentary
for the WORLD.

408
00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:05.800
I do not want to be accused of being a renegade.
I will not put up with this accusation of being a renegade.

409
00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:10.320
There have always been,
even in my time at the taz,

410
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.880
certain topics,
where I have to deal with comments in the WELT

411
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:20.240
rather agreed
than with comments in the taz,

412
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:21.880
e.g. on the subject of Israel.

413
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.800
But I am not a renegade

414
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.440
and a newspaper is not a religious
community and not a party.

415
00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.640
I am responsible for that
what I write myself.

416
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.200
Good.
Yes.

417
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.720
Are you happy with the answer?

418
00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.400
Um...
You apologized for that,

419
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.240
Thilo Sarrazin another
to have wished him a stroke.

420
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.680
And you wrote,
the departure of the Germans

421
00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.360
is the death of nations
from its most beautiful side.

422
00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:53.720
So you can already dish it out.

423
00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.240
Yes, but the one about Sarrazin
was a text,

424
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.200
which was about a
a certain paternalism,

425
00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:02.600
that prevailed at the time,

426
00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.880
of well-meaning Germans
towards the foreigners.

427
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.880
"The Foreigner Protection Officer"
was the title there.

428
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.800
That was a subordinate clause that I
I also regretted at the time.

429
00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.240
One could have written,
he's a dickhead or something.

430
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:22.840
That would be p.c. "A horst" or something.
That was not okay.

431
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.120
But the other one with the ...

432
00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:30.200
This column
was written on a whim.

433
00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.440
It was just some
investigation, statistics,

434
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:37.920
a study from the Institute
for Studies, which said,

435
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.160
Germans are doing away with themselves,
births are declining.

436
00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:45.240
To this I wrote in jest:
"Why not?"

437
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.560
But what is important to me,
also in the text:

438
00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.040
The Germans,
about whom I am writing,

439
00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:54.400
that meant
me and my kind with meant.

440
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.320
Which is not my thing,

441
00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.760
is the recourse
to something identitary, to say:

442
00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:03.440
The potatoes and I are People
of Color or some such bullshit.

443
00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.200
Bio-German.
No.

444
00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:08.600
The Germans, whose collective ...
Potato face.

445
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.320
The collective,

446
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.640
whose self-abolition
I have welcomed in this text,

447
00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.560
I am one of them.

448
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.400
But he's a dick face.

449
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.160
Who? - I have no regrets.
Who now? - Na Sarrazin.

450
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:25.440
You say that.
Ah! 3 more seconds, come on.

451
00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:30.360
Come on, faster.
So, that was Deniz Yücel.

452
00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:32.200
Have you been able to say everything?

453
00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.360
I am not sad that
AfDers and the AKPers hate me.

454
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:38.040
Also dick faces.

455
00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:40.600
How long will the AfD keep it up?

456
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.840
I don't know.
I hope not for long.

457
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.760
I say another four or five years,
then the oven is off.

458
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.560
Do we have to apologize?
You might, to Paul Ronzheimer.

459
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:55.280
I'll think about it.
Really, I mean it.

460
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.400
How? What should I say now?
I just answered.

461
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.040
That's up to you.

462
00:26:01.200 --> 00:26:04.720
If you were at the FAZ,
would you have said the same thing? - Yes.

463
00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.320
Yes? - I don't believe you.
Yes. - Good.

464
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.280
Deniz Yücel, thank you.

465
00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.120
* Music *

466
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.760
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

467
00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.160
# For me, formidable

468
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:36.080
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

469
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:43.120
# Et je voudrais pouvoir un jour
enfin te le dire

470
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:44.840
What does he want?

471
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.280
He was the first in fucking Moria.
This is not a BILD agitator.

472
00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.480
But is now Springer.

473
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.440
That's your head cinema.

474
00:26:56.680 --> 00:27:00.160
No, that's because you're now
at the WORLD. - No.

475
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:04.280
Oh, nonsense. - Would you have
ten years ago? - Yes.

476
00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:12.120
This "expropriated Springer folklore"
had a purpose in '68,

477
00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.440
but not only the WORLD ...

478
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.360
Can we still take this?
Now it's going to be great.

479
00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:19.120
Shall we start again?

480
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.840
The WELT is no longer the same
as it was in 1968, and neither is DIE ZEIT.

481
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.640
The WELT was always all right,
only Springer was ...

482
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.400
The WELT would not have
20 years ago.

483
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.320
And I would not have
wanted to go to the WORLD.

484
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:36.000
Are we at such an age,
where the... Is over?

485
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.840
No, it's not age.
It's less "me.

486
00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.240
Are we no longer riotous types?
No, on the contrary.

487
00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.360
I got the assignment from the WELT,
when I was poached

488
00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:51.400
or got the offer,
to go to Istanbul ...

489
00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:53.560
Poached?
Yeah, sure.

490
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.720
Couldn't you have said ...
Why don't you let me finish?

491
00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.640
"I'm still waiting for three,
four other offers"?

492
00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:04.000
"Pick up where you left off,
where you left off at the taz."

493
00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.120
This is a crucial point.

494
00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:10.520
Couldn't you have had three, four ...
Do you understand? - Yes.

495
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.480
Wouldn't you go to SAT.1,
when they say,

496
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:16.080
you can go on like this?
No.

497
00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.120
Do you mean the offers didn't come?
Didn't you make them? - No.

498
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.520
How long have I been
in the piss store? For 20 years.

499
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:26.680
But it was for me ...
Of course, I was poached.

500
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:32.040
That was the offer to go to Istanbul
to Istanbul. That was awesome.

501
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.600
You could have done
anywhere. - No.

502
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.280
You could have called
and said... - No.

503
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.840
You have no idea how the
correspondent system in newspapers

504
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.880
and with the public broadcasters
works.

505
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.560
Can we poach you?

506
00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:50.920
You must first have worked in the vineyard
of the Lord,

507
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:52.840
scrubbed for ten, 20 years.

508
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:55.720
What is the Lord's vineyard?
In the editorial office.

509
00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.680
Until you say, "So, Mr. Krömer,

510
00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.160
You have rendered outstanding services
in the foreign editorial department."

511
00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.280
Can we have that as a photo,
of him addressing me?

512
00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.880
"Don't you want to go to
Brussels as a correspondent?"

513
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.000
This is the usual course of events.

514
00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:14.000
That you get someone
from the outside and immediately ...

515
00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.600
We can go in again.
Yes, come.

516
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.880
Do you have any booze?
I am dry.

517
00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:24.040
But for you I would go to the gas station
and get a schnapps. Raki?

518
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.040
So ...

519
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.400
This is no longer
Live on tape, cameras off.

520
00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.440
What's it called?
Behind-the-scenes talk?

521
00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:39.160
Background Conversation.
This is a background conversation.

522
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.080
* Music *

523
00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:45.400
