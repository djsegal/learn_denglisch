00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.960
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.760
I will now lead you back
to the source of your fear.

4
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.720
(song)
"He lies at my feet ..."

5
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.240
Gereon!
My brother is still alive!

6
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.760
*You speak French.

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.400
I was forced to,
to leave Anno behind.

8
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.120
No sign of your brother?

9
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.960
The train pulls back.
And with it the wagon with the gold.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.800
There is no gold in the wagon.
The wagon numbers are mixed up.

11
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.720
They're talking about
that they're robbing the train.

12
00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.800
And it says exactly where:
Kilometer 127.

13
00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.560
Everyone will try
stop the train before it reaches the border.

14
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.240
All of them?
Well, Wolter. And Nyssen. Gereon!

15
00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.240
I'm stuck.
*She screams.

16
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.160
*He coughs and gasps for breath.

17
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.800
*He screams.

18
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.760
*stressed noises*

19
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.840
*He breathes frantically.

20
00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:59.160
*He groans.

21
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.760
*He breathes frantically.

22
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:38.920
Come on.

23
00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.160
Come on!

24
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.360
*He sobs.

25
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.320
*He breathes hard.

26
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:33.680
(yells) Come on!

27
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.280
*She coughs.

28
00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.880
*She coughs and gasps for breath.

29
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.480
*She coughs and chokes.

30
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.120
*She gasps for breath.

31
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:23.800
*uncanny music

32
00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.400
*rhythmic music

33
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:06.320
*Birds chirping

34
00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.520
Moon and sun ...

35
00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.480
Both there.

36
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.160
Yes, that happens.

37
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.280
Both the same size.

38
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.920
Will you carry me
all the way back to the city?

39
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.760
Of course.

40
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.560
*Engine noise

41
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.960
*exciting music*

42
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.800
What happened?

43
00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.320
Here the train route leads
through the forest,

44
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.240
but first we have to
through this village.

45
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.160
That takes too long.

46
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:13.160
There, we're going cross-country.
Through here.

47
00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.360
The tracks make a bend there.
So we can shorten the route.

48
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.600
*fast music

49
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.560
Take good care of them.

50
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.400
He drives better than me.

51
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.760
Gereon ...

52
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.880
Be careful.

53
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.960
*fast music

54
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:56.800
To the left.
- No, we have to go east.

55
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.440
The map is upside down, man.
- Why?

56
00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.640
Otherwise we would have to walk backwards.
- I see.

57
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.800
This way!
I told you.

58
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.400
Left, that's what I said.
- But I meant right.

59
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.240
*Czerwinski groans.

60
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.760
*driving music

61
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
And now?

62
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:18.880
Go!

63
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.320
(Henning) If the train is traveling faster
than 40 kilometers per hour,

64
00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.200
it's already over.

65
00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:30.560
Why is that?

66
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.920
Because he left three hours ago,
and we're at kilometer 120.

67
00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.680
You don't count
from the engine shed.

68
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.840
But what?
- I don't know.

69
00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.360
But you don't count from the engine shed
you happen to know that.

70
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.160
He wasn't here yet.
Boss! That's a stop sign.

71
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:52.920
Road closure.
- That's what I say.

72
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.440
When we are on the train,

73
00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:05.280
we have to expect it at every corner
with him at every turn.

74
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.600
With Wolter?
- And his men.

75
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:09.880
At every corner?
- I mean bend.

76
00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.240
No, you mean Kurve.
But why should the ...

77
00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.760
Psh!

78
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.840
*Sirren*

79
00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.480
Ready?

80
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.800
Yes.
- Yes.

81
00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:39.440
What is this?

82
00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.680
Did I miss a signal?
- No idea.

83
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.440
There's one on the track.

84
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:49.880
*Train whistles loudly.

85
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.680
*loud whistling*

86
00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.800
Police. Get rid of it!

87
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.800
Now listen to me carefully.

88
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.960
*shrill noise*

89
00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.200
*He screams.

90
00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:51.560
(No!

91
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:54.600
*She breathes quickly.

92
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.960
*She breathes quickly.

93
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:58.200
Gereon.

94
00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.320
Gereon.

95
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.400
*dark music*

96
00:11:14.320 --> 00:11:16.360
*distant rattling of the train*

97
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.600
*Brakes squeal.

98
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.920
Put your hands behind your head
and on the floor!

99
00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.400
A little zap, zap,
gentlemen!

100
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.520
Company, secure the train!
We are looking for wagon TY 2305!

101
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800
Psch.

102
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:14.560
*exciting music*

103
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:32.360
*dark music*

104
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.360
*He whistles appreciatively.

105
00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:01.000
*He groans strainedly.

106
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.760
*He laughs.

107
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.120
*quiet hiss*

108
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:27.400
*muffled shot*

109
00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.760
*muffled shot*

110
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.800
*three muffled shots

111
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.760
*dark music*

112
00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600
*He whistles.

113
00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:08.840
Psh!

114
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.600
Hey!

115
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.400
Everything clear out there?

116
00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.800
Your weapon.

117
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.800
Throw them here.

118
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:52.520
Up there.

119
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.200
You are not a hero.

120
00:15:57.960 --> 00:15:59.400
You're a traitor.

121
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:03.680
No values.

122
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.360
No morals.

123
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:08.400
No guts.

124
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.200
This is about something else.

125
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:17.240
And you?
You do your job by the book.

126
00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:19.520
Like all duck mice.

127
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:25.200
*Wolter groans.

128
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.840
*He groans.

129
00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:53.640
The ...

130
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.840
This is coal.

131
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.880
The ...

132
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.960
*He laughs in disbelief.

133
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.240
This is ...

134
00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.480
It's all garbage here.

135
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:15.680
*Wolter laughs.

136
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.160
Coal, coal!

137
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:28.800
Get up there!

138
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:30.960
Now!

139
00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.280
Get out!

140
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:47.960
Get down there!

141
00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.560
(I want to see your hands.

142
00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.640

Czerwinski?

*uncanny music

(Drop your weapon!

147
00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.560
Get out of there now!

148
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.240
Come down!

149
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.560
Gas!
- Gas is flowing out!

150
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.840
Gas!

151
00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.440
Drive off. Drive off!

Czerwinski?

155
00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.000
How long does the anesthesia last?

156
00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.400
Varies. 30 to 60 minutes.
- Half an hour to an hour.

157
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.000
That's what I say!

158
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:02.280
Where's Wolter? Is he down there?

159
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.960
Nope, gone.
- Not there.

160
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.440
Attention!

161
00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.600
Disarm, everyone!

162
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.440
Yes.
- Yes.

163
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:16.120
*Rumbles*

164
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.720
Hey there, boss! What now?
- And now?

165
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.560
Stay here!
Disarm the men!

166
00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.960
Yes! And you?
The train is leaving.

167
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.120
Go on, drive!

168
00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.760
Do it! Faster!
(coughs) Valve!

169
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.400
Full steam ahead!

170
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:15.760
If you pull the brakes,
I'll shoot you down!

171
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.640
*dark music*

172
00:21:56.560 --> 00:21:57.720
*Wolter groans.

00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:15.240
Ah!

174

(Radio announcer) On the cowardly
and devious attack

175
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:59.240
to Government Councillor Benda
and his family confessed

176
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:04.800
a previously unknown splinter
group of the Communist Party.

177
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.800
A service girl arrested on the spot
girl is currently under investigation.

178
00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:12.360
The act is presumably
in direct connection

179
00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:15.320
with the demonstrator killed on May 1
demonstrator killed on May Day

180
00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.400
on the side of the communists.

181
00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.800
The police
started during the night,

182
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.920
rebellious elements
to track down.

183
00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:26.200
The "Red Terror"
destabilize the republic

184
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.200
and must be fought
be combated,

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:47.200
The background to the accident is still
still completely in the dark.

*quiet music

190
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.600
*quiet music

191
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.320
(removed) Well, Junior?

192
00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.760
Miss Scheffler?

193
00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.800
Yes, Mr. Government Councillor?
- That one. Gone.

194
00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.960
And when you're done,

195
00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.600
Have the room thoroughly
fumigate the room.

196
00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.840
Well, disinfect.
- Very well.

197
00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.640
The boss has time for you now.

198
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.720
Mr. Government Councillor ...
I look forward to getting to know you.

199
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.840
Congratulations on the success of your manhunt
in your own ranks.

200
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:02.320
Thank you.
Have a seat.

201
00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.160
Cigarette?

202
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.880
Thank you.

203
00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:17.680
The events surrounding Mr. Wolter
and his illegal activities

204
00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:20.280
have given me food for thought.

205
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.320
It's getting more and more difficult,

206
00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.160
to
the political convictions

207
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.600
- even the closest colleagues
to be able to rely on them.

208
00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.640
I therefore thought
to set up a new department.

209
00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.160
I call it "internal auditing".

210
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.760
Irregularities
within our apparatus,

211
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.800
conspicuous political behavior,
corruption, that sort of thing.

212
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.280
I would like you to take over the management
of this department.

213
00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:51.520
Unofficial.

214
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.800
Officially, you remain
in the murder, of course.

215
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.000
Swear,
to tell the truth,

216
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.280
nothing but the truth?

217
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.960
So help me God.

218
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.640
I have here a
from your colleague,

219
00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.560
Mr. Commissioner Wolter, Bruno,
signed memorial protocol

220
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:16.920
of the events on May 1, 1929.

221
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:20.280
In it, your colleague accuses
the communists,

222
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.600
for shooting at him and her.

223
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.880
*mumble*

224
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.120
This contradicts
all statements,

225
00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:31.480
that we have heard in this trial from
heard from all the other witnesses.

226
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.440
I stand corrected:

227
00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.880
of all witnesses,

228
00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.240
who are not members
members of the Berlin police force.

229
00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:39.800
*mumble*

230
00:28:40.120 --> 00:28:43.400
Since Commissioner Wolter,
as I understand from the file,

231
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:46.840
has passed away,
you are invited alone today.

232
00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:48.680
Inspector Rath!

233
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.840
Can you confirm the information
confirm the information provided by your colleague?

234
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:57.520
Or do you want to add something today
add something under oath?

235
00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.760
*mumble*

236
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:09.400
We were shot at.

237
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.800
That is a lie!

238
00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.400
I confirm the statement
of my colleague.

239
00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:16.120
* angry shouts*

240
00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:17.760
Liar!

241
00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.440
The demonstrators have
opened fire on us.

242
00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.560
* angry shouts*

243
00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.360
(Quiet! Silence! Silence!

244
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.800
*The judge knocks on the table.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.840
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

247
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:43.960
Thank you. All right, all right.

248
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.200
Good performance. Everyone is grateful.
Thank you very much.

249
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:09.240
We have to go to the apartment
Sorokina's apartment.

250
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.280
We must not let this woman
just let her get away with it.

251
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:16.520
This was delivered for you today.

Yes, congratulations.

260
00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:58.280
Congratulations.

261
00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.880
Come on, let's go to Sorokina!

*calm, serious music

263
00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.240
How do you do?

264
00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:25.800
Please unlock
the Sorokina's apartment.

265
00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:27.880
Police.

*calm, serious music

267
00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.640
Flown out.

268
00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:11.640
Charlotte?

269
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.680
Take a look.

270
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.400
The family portrait.

271
00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.920
The old Sorokin
and his family.

272
00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.640
Eight children.

273
00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:27.000
And?

274
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.280
Where do you see Svetlana Sorokina?

275
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:34.800
Well, that little one there,
with her mother, right?

276
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.480
That's a boy.

277
00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.400
Look at that face.
The kid even has a sword.

278
00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.920
And the dress?

279
00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:45.280
A christening gown.

280
00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:50.560
You mean the Sorokins
don't have a daughter?

281
00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:54.280
In the picture
she is not.

282
00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.680
*she sighs.

283
00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.280
*uncanny music

284
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.320
The singer told me,

285
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:12.440
as children they played with the
with the chauffeur's daughter.

286
00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.440
The family chauffeur.

287
00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.880
He betrayed the Sorokins
to the Bolsheviks,

288
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.720
during the revolution.

289
00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:22.320
The entire family
was murdered.

290
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.760
The people in this picture,
they are all dead.

291
00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.840
Maybe Svetlana
the daughter of this chauffeur.

292
00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.440
That's why she also knew
about the gold,

293
00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.800
but not,
that it was fake.

294
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.400
There's our train.
A boiler is being poured back there.

295
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.760
Like our wagon.

296
00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.800
Take a look.

297
00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.120
That's not possible.

298
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:14.200
The boiler ...
The boiler itself ...

299
00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.880
is made of gold.
... is made of gold.

300
00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:55.800
(Ladies and gentlemen,
je suis enchanté de vous présenter

You!

312
00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:58.480
Leave it alone!

313
00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.640
I can't have it,
the swings. Do you hear me?!

315
00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:17.000
(Mr. Nyssen.
- Yes?

316
00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:18.840
Mrs. Rath is here.

317

*She sings in Russian.

*Svetlana sings in Russian.

Enough now!
Put him up against the wall!

321
00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.440
In the name of the oppressed masses

324
00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.400
Away! Everyone away!

325
00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.200
Go!

326
00:40:01.360 --> 00:40:03.640
(Dr. Schmidt) Breathe very calmly.

327
00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360
A ...

328
00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.280
And also from.

329
00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:13.720
Good.

330
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:19.640
And when I say "now",
you will open your eyes.

331
00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.640
Now.

332
00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:31.120
Yes, close your eyes again.

333
00:40:32.320 --> 00:40:34.400
Good, good.

334
00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.600
And now go twice as deep
into your relaxation as before.

335
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.400
I am now counting backwards.

336
00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.720
Five ...

337
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:53.240
And you imagine a place
where you feel safest.

338
00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.960
Four ...

339
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.640
A place where you are safe.

340
00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.200
Loved.

341
00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:02.160
Safe.

342
00:41:04.520 --> 00:41:08.720
Maybe it's
in the bosom of your family, huh?

343
00:41:15.960 --> 00:41:19.760
I will lead you back now,
to the source.

344
00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.480
To the source of your fear.

*exciting music*

346
00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:37.880
You are in Cologne,
in your home town.

347
00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:41.640
It's the summer,
just before you move in.

348
00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:55.720
You long so much,
to go to war.

349
00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:58.920
You are dying to
to finally leave here,

350
00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.960
to leave everything behind you.

351
00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:06.600
There is the woman
you love.

352
00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:11.840
But there is something,
that separates you from her.

353
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:19.600
*exciting music*

354
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.800
I will guide you.

355
00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.600
Step by step.

356
00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:28.240
Step by step.

357
00:42:29.400 --> 00:42:31.960
All the way to the source of your fear.

358
00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.120
All the way to the truth.

*Shots, neighing

It is November 4, 1918,
shortly before nine o'clock in the morning.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:49.200
The front line
between Malmaison and Laffaux.

362
00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:50.840
Three ...

363
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:55.160
It is now
nine minutes past nine.

*Gereon breathes shakily.

Even though the visibility is so poor,

the enemy intensifies
its new offensive.

367
00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.400
*He whimpers.

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.960
At "one" you will wake up.

370
00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:30.400
You will open your eyes

371
00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.000
and finally the images of truth
over the lie.

372
00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.240
Two ...

373
00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:51.880
But you have to remember the image of truth
already remember.

374
00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:04.880
(weakly) Gereon!

375
00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.160
Gereon!

376
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.480
*loud buzz*

377
00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:21.840
*The buzzing stops.

378
00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.720
*sob*

379
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:39.560
And if you now
open your eyes,

380
00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.280
fear will be a thing of the past.

381
00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.800
One.

382
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.640
*dark music*

383
00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:09.640
Do you recognize me?

384
00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.120
Anno?

385
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.600
Yes.

386
00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:31.920
Get up, Gereon.

387
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.120
*Gereon sobs.
