00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.120
.

2
00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.120
So, the show is about to start.

3
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.040
He just keeps me waiting, dude.

4
00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.680
No matter.

5
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.200
(transmit line) On position.

6
00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.600
(from video)
So, the show is about to start.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.640
(Krömer) Thank you. - (from video)
He just makes me wait, dude.

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.360
We start the recording.
Have fun.

9
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.760
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.080
# For me, formidable

11
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.080
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

12
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.520
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

13
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.320
* Cough *

14
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.760
Kida Ramadan, 44 years old,

15
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.840
Actor,
director and film producer.

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400
Breakthrough with the series "4 Blocks".

17
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.320
The Tagesspiegel wrote:

18
00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.360
"A character actor with a
B-movie visage and teddy-bear physique."

19
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.320
* Kida laughs. *
Are you... Kida? - Yes.

20
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.320
You know, now...
I am really happy.

21
00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.720
Ditto.
We have otherwise ...

22
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.640
Have you seen the format yet?
It's a highlight for me.

23
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.440
We have only assholes here,
only morons,

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.560
really borderline assholes.

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.520
And now you come. - Yes.

26
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.680
Horny.
The most beautiful day in my life.

27
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.440
(Berlin dialect) I am pleased.
Me too.

28
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.960
It's not a lie.
(laughs) I'm really happy.

29
00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:41.360
Am I staying here now?
A whole new feeling: joy.

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.680
Kida.
How do we do that now?

31
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.440
Although we are tested,
we are not allowed to touch each other.

32
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.000
Is a bit silly.
This situation seems to me ...

33
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.160
In my many films
I have often been interrogated. - Yes.

34
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.920
Now another interrogation scene.
Are you in character or in private?

35
00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.560
Now I'm half and half right now.

36
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.400
A little ...
Fuck it, sunglasses away.

37
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.520
I am mega happy,
to finally be allowed to sit here.

38
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.000
We are friends through Insta,

39
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.200
for four years
for coffee for four years.

40
00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.800
The first question:
Why doesn't it work?

41
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.640
Did we need social media,
to get to know each other? No, did we?

42
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.840
Shit, why don't we meet
meet? Because you have so much to do.

43
00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.680
You have a lot to do.
No, I'm not doing anything.

44
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.360
Well, come on.
One or two shows for the rbb.

45
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.280
At last
two Berliners at one table. - Yes.

46
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.840
This is no longer known in Berlin.

47
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.680
I am Urberliner.
Where are you? - Kreuzberg.

48
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.760
I am Wedding.
Well, okay.

49
00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.360
But Kreuzberg was ...
Fine people.

50
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.320
Also dangerous.
All gold.

51
00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.920
At the beginning of the 90s you already needed
a visa to Berlin-Kreuzberg.

52
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.160
Kreuzberg. - We were even ...
Who was poorer off, you or me?

53
00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.800
Financially, you mean? - In general.
Wedding was the same shit.

54
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.920
It was the same shit, dude.
Wedding, Kreuzberg.

55
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.360
Watch it, Kida. I'll be honest with you,
why I invited you.

56
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.320
"4 Blocks" or what?
(laughs) "4 Blocks," yes.

57
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.240
But that's a pity.
Have you looked at my questions?

58
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.880
No, but ... - How did you
come up with that, fox?

59
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.360
But maybe we will
learn more than "4 Blocks".

60
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.520
The question is:
Does it go on or not?

61
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.000
I'll tell you at the end of the show.

62
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.040
Then you say, "Kida,
answer me the question now."

63
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.240
Until then, I don't have any questions.
I only have "4 Blocks" questions.

64
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.560
Okay.
That sucks.

65
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.240
Then let us
be quiet all the time ...

66
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.720
29 minutes say nothing
and in the last minute:

67
00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.040
"Kida, is the show going on?"

68
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.960
But like ...
I am an absolute fan.

69
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.600
I am a fan of yours,
I swear to you.

70
00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.360
I can't watch any presenters,
no program on television.

71
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.800
I only watch your show.
No.

72
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.720
I swear to you by everything
that is sacred to me.

73
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.760
Brother ...
That's just how it is for me.

74
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.920
I only watch "4 Blocks".
No shit, just because of you.

75
00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.480
I've already watched it 30 times.
What else do you want to watch on TV?

76
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:20.360
All idiots, that's right.
I am the best.

77
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.080
With all modesty
I have to say,

78
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.160
that this is really
the best format in Germany.

79
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.440
Yours too,
because it is real.

80
00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.480
A ... * (beeping)
you finish here.

81
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.040
And you love a friend.
This is the world.

82
00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.320
We have some ...
* beep * there.

83
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.440
That's why I'm really happy
to be on your show.

84
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.560
Many think,
you do comedy, but ...

85
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.720
Comedy? Are you trying to insult me?
(laughs) No.

86
00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.080
What you do,
is socially critical.

87
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.560
This is not comedy.
I'm an actor, so are you.

88
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.920
I am an actor.
We are colleagues.

89
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.280
Castle actor I am.

90
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.840
You know what would give me goose bumps?
The two of us as "Tatort" detectives.

91
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.680
Awesome. - Do you know what happens
with the ratings?

92
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.600
Kreuzberg CID. KK.
Kreuzkölln CID.

93
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.160
Kida Ramadan, Kurt Krömer:
Kreuzberg CID.

94
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.880
Kurt Krömer, Kida Ramadan:
Kreuzkölln CID.

95
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.160
Your name first.
Mine? Okay, let's do it.

96
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.760
But not produced by rbb.

97
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.560
Why not? - ZDF.

98
00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.560
ZDF doesn't make Tatorte, does it?
No matter, then they'll have to change.

99
00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.320
But rbb is all right,
is home, brother. - Yes, but ...

100
00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.560
* (SIGHS)
They don't pay well, do they?

101
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.720
(sighs) Oh... - I once did
a crime scene for them.

102
00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.640
They really paid shit,
Dude, rbb.

103
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.320
I have shot
a Berlin crime scene.

104
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.160
You, here, camera three.

105
00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.080
To all the rbb managers
and producers up there.

106
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.160
To the executive floor. - Executive floor.

107
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.840
You did not pay well at that time,
10% was taken by the agency,

108
00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.280
Tax office a bit.
Taxes too.

109
00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.840
I didn't know that if you work for
rbb, you have to pay taxes.

110
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.960
* (LAUGHING)
I have to pay tax on everything.

111
00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.440
44% I have to pay tax on.
Yes, you don't.

112
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.280
There's half gone,
so as I said ...

113
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:15.160
I swear to you,
if I get an offer now,

114
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.400
they say:
You get this and that.

115
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.280
If you do the math,
it's a trifle.

116
00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.200
"4 Blocks": Now they're all dead.

117
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.480
How should ...
Who says?

118
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.480
Well, they're all dead,
were shot.

119
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.920
When you do the fourth season,
is it like "Dallas"?

120
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.680
No, but...
Bobby Ewing is actually dead.

121
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.480
Did you see..,
that someone shot me?

122
00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.200
You don't, but the others do.

123
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:45.240
Make that like "Dallas."

124
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.000
18 tough guys
stand naked in the shower

125
00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.200
and Sue Ellen is to blame,
because she dreamed it all.

126
00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.680
Then everyone can live again.
I was the "Denver Clan" guy.

127
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:57.920
Do you remember
that Eastern broadcast,

128
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:02.160
where such a guy, Adi,
with two stripes... - Yes.

129
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:05.720
This sports program. - "Join in,
do it, do it better".

130
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.400
I celebrated that.
Adolf was his name.

131
00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.880
The station
preferred to call him Adi.

132
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:15.720
So two strips ... - Exactly.
Two classes, dodgeball and stuff.

133
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.240
This was my highlight on Sundays
8:30 a.m. on East TV. Shit, dude.

134
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.520
Now again
very dear the question ... Yes.

135
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.480
What's next for "4 Blocks"?
Uh...

136
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.560
* Ringtone *
Uh... - Is your cell phone on?

137
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.200
I thought you were authentic.
Do you have a message?

138
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.480
No ...
Shall we pause for a moment?

139
00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:37.440
No, "4 Blocks."
Yes.

140
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.800
To date, it does not go on at all.

141
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.520
We said,
that was the last season.

142
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:47.840
And... - You know what?
Look, interrogation room. - Yeah.

143
00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400
We are now shooting here
the fourth season of "4 Blocks".

144
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.240
Okay. - You are...
You're directing.

145
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.880
No, watch out.
You are Toni Hamady. I am...

146
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.000
Horst Tappert.
That was the fat man ...

147
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.160
No, Kurt Tappert, Duisburg CID.
Okay.

148
00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.920
And you are now ...
You are interrogating me.

149
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.040
Exactly.
I'm coming back in.

150
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:15.680
Okay... - Don't be alarmed, I am
a different character than before.

151
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.760
But so am I, dude.
Me too.

152
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.400
And remember, it's an act.
You remember, too, it's an act.

153
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.520
Do not interrupt.
No matter how I get in.

154
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:28.680
I am 100% Toni Hamady,
I swear to you. - Okay, Diggi.

155
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.560
Ha! But now we have you.

156
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.920
Toni Hamady?

157
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.360
My name is Ali Hamady.
I beg your pardon?

158
00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.600
My name is Ali Hamady.
Toni Hamady, I thought.

159
00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.920
Look
the file properly, please.

160
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.480
Toni ... Ali Hamady is standing here.
Why do you want to interrogate me?

161
00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.080
You are under arrest,
that's a fact now.

162
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:06.040
You are here in the interrogation room.

163
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.160
We caught you in the U8,

164
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:16.800
Schönleinstraße, in the course of a
of a BVG ticket inspection.

165
00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.120
You said,
that you had a short route,

166
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.280
but did not have a ticket for it.

167
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.480
Mr. Krömer, listen to me.
Not Krömer.

168
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.880
Mr. Tappert, listen carefully.
Herr Oberkommissar.

169
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:31.200
No, Chief Detective Inspector.

170
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.400
Superintendent ... - Inspector.
Inspector Tappert.

171
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:36.480
Duisburg CID.
Listen carefully.

172
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.640
When I was a kid
had a fight,

173
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:42.640
my mother
was not worried about me,

174
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:45.120
but about the children,
who got beatings.

175
00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.400
So watch your tongue.

176
00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.240
I bought the BVG, that's why
I rode the U8, habibi. Okay?

177
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.520
You can't ...
Is the BVG state-owned?

178
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.160
I am Toni Hamady, I can do anything.
Please?

179
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.720
I'm Toni Hamady, I can do anything.
Do you own BVG?

180
00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.600
I own the BVG.
Then it was my mistake.

181
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.400
Uh...
* (CLEARS THROAT)

182
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.560
Uh... Then you are free.
It's called LVG now.

183
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:13.920
Lebanese Transport Community.

184
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:18.160
The passage to the GDR is
is approved and Toni Hamady is free.

185
00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.680
Then you would now be ...
That's exactly how it is.

186
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.800
This now applies, as I read here,
immediately. So immediately.

187
00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.400
You can leave now.

188
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:32.000
But I still want to be interrogated.
No, there is no more.

189
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:34.760
It's an acquittal, after all.
* (clears throat)

190
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.800
Mr. Tappert.
(laughs) Yes?

191
00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:41.480
I have seen you play
with Lars Becker.

192
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.680
Just a moment, please, Kida.
Again?

193
00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:47.680
Can you keep it down, please?
I'm doing business here.

194
00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.360
I hate that.
Do you know it too? - Yes.

195
00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:56.720
Someone has opened
Candy wrappers. - Really, yeah?

196
00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.560
Yes, give it to him, brother.

197
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.760
* Banging *

198
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.800
So.

199
00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.960
That's just...
I swear to you.

200
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:14.320
Mr. Meier? To the director:
We only have four cameras left.

201
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:19.480
Manfred has a headache. - You are
the hottest guy on German TV.

202
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.320
You are gold. - Please?
You are gold.

203
00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:26.080
(laughs) Are we still in character?
No. - No.

204
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.720
Oh, no. - Okay.

205
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.360
Shall we talk about
your biography? - With pleasure.

206
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.200
Your parents fled
because of the civil war in Lebanon

207
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.320
to Germany.
Why Berlin?

208
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.840
I think,
Berlin was not wanted at all.

209
00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.640
Australia was wanted,
but Berlin got in the way.

210
00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:48.080
And then you
landed in Berlin.

211
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.520
And your father
was a businessman in Lebanon?

212
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.760
That's right, the one for ... What's it called?
Persil. - Henkel, right?

213
00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:59.360
Was that Henkel?
Yes, Henkel was Persil.

214
00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.560
Bartels, Bertels? No.
I don't know.

215
00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.800
Persil was Henkel.
And glue, I think.

216
00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:08.880
He did a good job there,
had a good job.

217
00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:12.280
But then there was the balling.

218
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.040
How was the changeover?

219
00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:18.120
As a successful businessman
fled to Berlin ...

220
00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.160
You have to start from scratch.

221
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.480
He started at Burger King.

222
00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:26.560
And he had
an Argentine steakhouse. - Yes.

223
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.200
Why Argentine?

224
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.920
Many Lebanese who worked
worked in Germany,

225
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:37.000
have worked in the kitchen,
also in steakhouses and pizzerias.

226
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.520
Is it called pizzerias?
Pizzerias. - Is that the name?

227
00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:43.200
Pizzas... Pizzas.
Store for pizzas.

228
00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:46.640
Yes, Italian inn.
Anyway, let's cut together.

229
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.320
We are being synchronized,
someone will know.

230
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.760
His brother
worked in the steakhouse

231
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.280
and business was good,
until the BSE scandal.

232
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.680
Then my father went bankrupt and ...

233
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.960
Peace be upon him.

234
00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:08.480
Your father always wanted you
that you become a politician.

235
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:10.120
Was he serious?

236
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:17.040
Yes, my father had a strong
a strong interest in politics.

237
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.800
Back then, "Tagesschau"
8:15 p.m. was a highlight.

238
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.880
That's what they were looking at.
I know. Until um...

239
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.040
What was the regulation?
No more phone calls from 8 o'clock.

240
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.040
That was the Internet.
You were no longer allowed to call.

241
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.320
Lebanon was often
on the news, because of the war.

242
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:37.240
People wanted to know..,
what was going on there.

243
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.320
On the daytime news there were
many politicians and I thought:

244
00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:44.400
"Kida, either
you're going to be a lawyer or a politician."

245
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:47.000
Have you really considered
considered that?

246
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.400
I begged the directors
and producers:

247
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:54.200
Toni Hamady has to become
become mayor of Neukölln.

248
00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:57.240
That was my thing:
To become a politician again.

249
00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:00.560
It's like that anyway,
when you walk through Neukölln.

250
00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:03.880
People are going crazy, aren't they?
You know what I thought?

251
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:07.840
What was the guy's name, the politician?
Ronald Reagan was also once ...

252
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.400
He was an actor. - Yes.
But became president of America.

253
00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:14.960
If I want to become mayor,
what do you have to do?

254
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.880
Once you have the job, I don't think
I don't think you have to do much more.

255
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:23.840
But I have to print posters.
Yes, the employees do that.

256
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.200
"Kida cleans the streets."

257
00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:29.560
Every now and then you have to
give a press conference ...

258
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:31.960
I swear to you,
I can do this.

259
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:35.080
You would be a good mayor
in Neukölln, wouldn't you?

260
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.040
I would do anything ...
But why only mayor?

261
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.720
Why not Chancellor?
Too much work, brother. - You think?

262
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.880
Always small, private,
dribble a little left and right.

263
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:47.800
Or federal president.

264
00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:50.080
No.
You have nothing to do there.

265
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:53.240
That's right.
He has no influence.

266
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.560
He has his speechwriters,
sits in Bellevue Palace

267
00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.840
and gambles
Playstation all day.

268
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.160
Me with my six children
at Bellevue Palace. - Cool.

269
00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:04.920
One room each.
No, three each. - Four each.

270
00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.600
* I should have told you
that you can't smoke.

271
00:15:08.920 --> 00:15:12.240
But I'm in character.
Right, well prepared.

272
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.400
That was a good one.
You're in character, then it works.

273
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.480
So, watch out.
Gun at the table, smoking ...

274
00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.320
Another question: Toni Hamady,
you are now "4 Blocks" ...

275
00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:26.960
Uh...

276
00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:30.880
You were lucky to be known
as Toni Hamady.

277
00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.880
I was at the casting,
I fought for the role.

278
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.000
Who else was in the conversation?
Who was in the conversation?

279
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:40.120
Anyone who had black hair
and said:

280
00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.080
"I'm an actor,
I want to try it too."

281
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:44.720
Everyone was there.
(laughs) Yes?

282
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.200
"Are you guys
Casting for '4 Blocks'?"

283
00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:50.000
"No, what am I supposed to do there?"
Everyone was in the waiting room.

284
00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.840
Yes, all of them. - You know?

285
00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.760
That's a cool role,
Toni Hamady, "4 Blocks".

286
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.920
You could also have
become known

287
00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:06.240
through "Rosamunde Pilcher" films
as Count Coke of Edinburgh Castle.

288
00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.000
But I would not have done that.

289
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:10.840
Are you proud of the role
or do you say:

290
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.720
"Stop it,
"Stop giving me petty criminals all the time,

291
00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.760
To give rapists, etc."?

292
00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.400
So not the bad boys, but ...

293
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.480
The role was extremely good for me.

294
00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:27.320
I wanted to show the German film industry
the German film industry: There's a Lebanese guy,

295
00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.800
who came to Germany
and would like to be an actor.

296
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.360
Don't give him the late-night owner.
Exactly.

297
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.280
I had
radically many facets to show,

298
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.560
which I was allowed to tell
in three seasons.

299
00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.320
That is why I am
very grateful for this role.

300
00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:46.200
It is also good that the series
does not continue in that sense.

301
00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.120
I didn't want to become Winnetou.

302
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.160
It does not go any further,
you just said. - No.

303
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.720
But ... - Huh, we still have
still 10 minutes.

304
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.960
What do you mean, it doesn't go any further?
You have on Insta...

305
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:03.480
What do I have? - At Insta you sat
with a gun and... - Yes.

306
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.760
What did I say?
That it continues.

307
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:10.320
I didn't say that.
They have recast.

308
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.560
No, no. - Kurt Krömer is ...
You never know what's going to happen.

309
00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.400
Did you have a fight? - No, we didn't,
we didn't fight.

310
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.200
We were really a family.
The channel TNT ...

311
00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.480
is as great as the rbb.

312
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.720
If not even better.
TNT pays well, brother.

313
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.640
Yes? - TNT pays great.

314
00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:34.040
You didn't have a fight?
Sure there was...

315
00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.040
Then I have nothing to tell.
We need an arc of suspense.

316
00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.080
Of course there were arguments during the shoot.
Did you ever get punched in the face?

317
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:45.040
Also this.
"Remember the words, you bum."

318
00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.680
You, there was.

319
00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.360
Marvin Kren from the first season
is a full-blooded director.

320
00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:52.960
I celebrate the,
who gives you a whip

321
00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:56.720
and the other moment he embraces you
you and leaves tears. - Psycho.

322
00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:01.760
No, not a psycho. - A psycho,
who just has the right job.

323
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:03.800
No, he's alive, Marvin Kren.

324
00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.720
Like in a family:
You argue and love each other.

325
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.800
You have won prizes without end.
You have ...

326
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.640
Television award. - Television Prize.
I have too.

327
00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.880
Grimme Prize? - Did you?
Did you?

328
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:21.840
How many? - One.
You have one? - I have one.

329
00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.480
Someone here has more,
but we do not say who.

330
00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.120
How many? - Two.

331
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:32.280
Respect. - Can we do that...
Cut! We cut again.

332
00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:37.760
How many? - We noticed
that one has two Grimme awards.

333
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.600
You know what makes me proud?
Let's be honest.

334
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.120
That's a problem among actors.
Are you jealous of me?

335
00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.240
That you hate me now ...
No, your performance ...

336
00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:55.120
When I see who is nominated every year for
nominated for a Grimme Award,

337
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.080
I think:
Dude, what's going on?

338
00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:01.360
If you're nominated,
I say, chapeau.

339
00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.800
Cool attitude.
You have earned it.

340
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:10.480
When you said "two," I thought:
Dude, he only has two?

341
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:13.320
If I've been doing your business
for so long,

342
00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:16.200
I would have ten pieces
or given up this profession.

343
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.080
Brother, you are Kurt Krömer.

344
00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.240
You are legend, cult. - Intrigue.
I was also bullied a lot.

345
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.920
I might have gotten eleven,
but murder and manslaughter.

346
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:32.040
Freddy Lau I always tease ...
What is Freddy Lau like?

347
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.000
He would sit here at the table
and hug you.

348
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.200
You know what I'm afraid of?
I think Freddy Lau is cool.

349
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.760
But I am afraid
that you get to know the

350
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.960
and then it turns out:
Asshole.

351
00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:46.280
No, on the contrary.
Do you know it? - He loves you.

352
00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.720
He celebrates you.
He has such a heart.

353
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:51.440
We are friends.
I always tease him.

354
00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:54.360
You know what I don't like
about that? - What?

355
00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:58.280
He comes from Steglitz.
He is a really proud Steglitzer.

356
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.920
He's always babbling about it, too.

357
00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.280
Wedding, Kreuzberg, Steglitz.
You see for yourself. - Bravo, bravo.

358
00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.160
What do they have there?
Forum Steglitz.

359
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.720
Forum Steglitz. - Okay, good.
* (LAUGHING)

360
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.000
He won the Comedy Award for "Neue Vahr Süd
won the Comedy Award.

361
00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:17.200
I always laugh myself sick.

362
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.840
Yes, laughable.
Why are you at rbb?

363
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.480
* Sigh * Pity.
Why not like Jan Böhmermann?

364
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:27.280
He's doing one on ZDFneo:
"I'm so cult, I'm staying."

365
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.320
Yeah, they don't want me.

366
00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:33.920
I am prejudiced,
because I was at rbb for too long.

367
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.240
Do you have a real contract?
Box office poison is me.

368
00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:42.280
Do you have a contract? - Yes, my
My children have to do shows here,

369
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.200
I have signed
signed a gagging contract.

370
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.960
Really, I have children,
they perform for me.

371
00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.880
Krömer South, Krömer North, you know?
Like at ALDI.

372
00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.440
Is so,
a sad story.

373
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.120
Let's not talk about it.
I celebrate you.

374
00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.080
I get once again
into the character. - Yes.

375
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:03.480
I see, we still wanted to ...
You are now ...

376
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.200
We haven't finished that yet.
Yes.

377
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.760
Are you satisfied with your
Role offerings or do you say:

378
00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.040
"Habibi, now I want to
play a chancellor"?

379
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:19.120
Meanwhile I get the respect
and am often asked for roles,

380
00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.480
where I can speak
German may speak.

381
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.600
Is that racist: "You can't play
you can't play chancellor,

382
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.520
because you come from Lebanon"?

383
00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:31.200
It's racist, isn't it?
I don't think it's racist.

384
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.640
The mindset in Germany,
how to cast actors,

385
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.640
is still somewhat behind,

386
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.360
although Germany
is very progressive.

387
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.440
In France and Scandinavia
plays the Algerian

388
00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.040
the French class teacher.

389
00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:48.680
In Germany, we are
on a good path,

390
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:53.520
that we fill roles better,
not by nationality.

391
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.000
The only one who does,
is Lars Becker.

392
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.920
Lars Becker is one of the few,
who do that.

393
00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.680
He says, "I don't care where you come from,
you're right for the part."

394
00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.320
You are now also a director.

395
00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.640
What's the point?
You are a jack of all trades.

396
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.080
At some point I thought to myself:

397
00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:16.080
As a director, I can make a UFO
land on the Sonnenallee.

398
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:19.840
I can stage things
that a director wouldn't dare to do.

399
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.360
And if I don't dare
to cast the character differently,

400
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:27.960
according to performance
and not according to nationality

401
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.760
or tell my stories
can tell them myself ...

402
00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:34.280
That's a big advantage.
I have used my name,

403
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:39.120
my reputation, I have built,
used my connection.

404
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:42.800
I wanted to make a film,
went to ARD,

405
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:47.800
I bet on risk, on cinema
and have managed everything.

406
00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:51.360
I'm doing a fat series soon
for a big streamer.

407
00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.240
A major world streamer ...
Amazon.

408
00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:58.640
Excuse me? - Amazon.
Not so small channels. - Netflix.

409
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.360
You said.

410
00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:04.480
An excerpt of your film
"There's no orange tree growing in Berlin".

411
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.880
Do you have that one? - Of course, Diggi.
Goose bumps.

412
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:11.320
Enough tobacco for all there.

413
00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.120
* He speaks Turkish. *

414
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.200
Cool.
Yes, a bit arthouse.

415
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.960
Is there anywhere I can see this?

416
00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.080
I'll send you the link.
No, all the viewers.

417
00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:47.800
I do not need advertising, I
am advertising. - Okay, sorry.

418
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.240
You don't need one either,
you are a brand.

419
00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.960
I am ...
You are Kurz Krömer, double K.

420
00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.640
I am 46 now, Grand Seigneur.

421
00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.680
Brother, we are four times K.
We are ...

422
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.760
Kurt Krömer, Kida Khodr Ramadan.
Yeah, right.

423
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:04.760
Kurt Inspector Krause Kurt.

424
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.640
To the ARDs ...
Christian Ulmen was also comedy.

425
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.080
But you're not comedy, bro.
What am I? - Not comedy.

426
00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:15.400
What am I? I have been asking myself that
for 46 years. - You are real.

427
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:19.960
You are real. - Yes?
We have to become crime scene detectives.

428
00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.080
This rbb ...
Who is this rbb?

429
00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.560
Send it in to me, this rbb.
Who are these rbb?

430
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.960
Is there a Tatort on the rbb?
Yeah, sure, the Berlin Tatort, man,

431
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.320
where a highway exit
is shown.

432
00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.240
Then we talk
with the current main actors

433
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.920
and ask
if this shit is going to go on forever.

434
00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.560
We have the best ideas.

435
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.920
The new Tatort detectives
from Berlin. - Kreuzberg CID.

436
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.920
I don't take any other city,
when they say: in Hamburg.

437
00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:51.400
Hamburg is beautiful,
you can party there.

438
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:55.880
Working in Berlin ... - You did
Comedy with Bully Herbig.

439
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.040
Yeah, sure. - Is he funny?
He's funny.

440
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:01.480
This is really cool.
So now ...

441
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.960
Amazon. May I ...

442
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.440
Can I just say that this
a smash hit on Amazon?

443
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.520
I don't find Bully Herbig
that funny. - Yes, he is. Watch it.

444
00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.320
I am being threatened
with three pistols...

445
00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.000
Is it not allowed to say Amazon?

446
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.200
I don't know
whether Amazon belongs to rbb.

447
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:25.160
I'm looking at it. - I do not know
who bought whom.

448
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.040
Is rbb the poorest station in
Germany? - No, Radio Bremen.

449
00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.480
Radio Bremen.
Not Alex TV? - No.

450
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:35.160
Alex TV is an open channel, after all.
Ah, okay.

451
00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.240
Okay, shit.
We are done.

452
00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:41.600
Is Toni Hamady still alive,
was the question, or ...

453
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.520
No, of course you are still alive.

454
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.520
Toni Hamady is still alive,
but your environment is gone.

455
00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:50.120
You are the hottest guy.
(laughs) Everyone is dead.

456
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.320
Uh...
So it doesn't go any further.

457
00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.440
For the time being
unfortunately no further.

458
00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:57.680
What now?
Does it go on or not?

459
00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.600
Clear edge now.
Will it go on or not?

460
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.840
In any case
no further for the time being, no.

461
00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.520
That means yes,
it will continue in three years.

462
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:11.320
If it would continue,
you don't know...

463
00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.160
Would you join us?
Of course.

464
00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:17.360
I am anyway
a little offended that I ...

465
00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:19.760
Look, where is this series set?

466
00:26:20.520 --> 00:26:22.320
Yes.
Where is the series set? - Bravo.

467
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.840
Please? - In Neukölln.
Yes, and who ...

468
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.040
You were born in Neukölln.

469
00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:30.400
Where was I born?
Neukölln Hospital. Rudow.

470
00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:34.840
I have built my entire empire
on this origin.

471
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.440
You've been waiting for this series.
Then comes "4 Blocks" from Neukölln.

472
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.000
Coincidence!
And you are not asked.

473
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:45.680
I'm not even
late-buy owner or anything.

474
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:51.000
I could have said in the Späti once:
Hello, Mr. Hamady.

475
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:54.960
Then you could have said:
Okay, he's in.

476
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:58.080
If it continues,
I honestly don't know,

477
00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:01.480
I will definitely put my hand
in the fire and say:

478
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:04.680
Double K has to be there.
Double K is awesome.

479
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.880
Okay.
But it doesn't go any further.

480
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.240
(groans) This sucks.
How do we end the show now?

481
00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:12.320
Sucks.

482
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:14.760
You ...
We become crime scene detectives.

483
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.920
That would be awesome.
I would do that with you.

484
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.840
Come on, let's have
a press conference.

485
00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.120
Is it closing time?
Yes, unfortunately.

486
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.240
It's only half an hour.
Doesn't rbb give more broadcasting space?

487
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:31.040
What do I do now?
You have to stand here.

488
00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.680
Press conference. - Okay.

489
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:35.480
First let
let the people clap. - Yes.

490
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:37.760
Say thank you. - Thank you very much.

491
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.360
Thank you for being there,
dear ones.

492
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.240
By the way, you have never looked
looked so fantastic as tonight.

493
00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.160
Very nice.
Now you have to say again:

494
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.840
Thank you. - Thank you.
Very ambivalent audience.

495
00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.840
Yes, great people.
But it was fully d'accord.

496
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.880
Ad hoc the situation is great.

497
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.640
Please? - Ad hoc the situation
is super. - Super.

498
00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.400
I try
to speak good German. - What?

499
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:05.160
Your German is fantastic,
but the record is crap. - Okay.

500
00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.560
So, we now announce,
that we,

501
00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:11.480

has just been assured to us
by the Intendanz.

504

506

No, I'm with Jan Böhmermann on that one.

507
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:31.640
Then on April 23 we start

Kida Ramadan.
I do not have to say anything more?

00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.040
Please? - Do I have to say anything else?
You can say whatever you want.

512
00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.160
Greetings,
I am Kida Ramadan.

513
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:46.680
I thank you very much,
that through the rbb

514
00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.560
met the contact
with Mr. Krömer,

515
00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:52.280
who is very sympathetic to me.
Go ahead and say you.

516
00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.280
I wanted to be serious.
Oh, yes.

517
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.320
Because of this pedestal.

518
00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.800
We fade in that you are
Mayor of Neukölln.

519
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:03.760
I will be the next mayor of the...
What is it called?

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.360
Win the mayoral election.
No, first try ...

521
00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:10.080
With an assurance of the people
of 100%.

522
00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:14.440
Who would like to see me as Neukölln's
mayor? - Me.

523
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.280
Write me on Insta
and tags Kurt Krömer.

524
00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.720
* Laughter *

525
00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.360
Was that serious?
I think so. - Only.

526
00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:26.040
Well, then I thank you
for watching. Bye.

527
00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.880
We're going to learn text now, come.
