00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
.

2
00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.760
* Music *

3
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.560
(Berlin dialect) Mrs.
Krozeschewski, the Höller file ...

4
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.400
It's not on top, no.

5
00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.560
That's where I would see them.

6
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.480
Heated, Hectic ...

7
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.200
Hitler ...
* Audience laughs. *

8
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.000
Höller, all clear.

9
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.000
Please take
the rest of the evening free.

10
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960
Yes, see you
tomorrow morning 4:30 in the office.

11
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.480
Yes.

12
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.520
So ...

13
00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.560
Let's see what the cat
put in front of the door.

14
00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.200
Name: Jürgen Höller.

15
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.280
55 years old, most successful
motivational trainer in Germany.

16
00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.400
Role models:
Nelson Mandela, Muhammad Ali,

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.000
Steve Jobs and Jesus Christ.

18
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.800
* Laughter *

19
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.760
It's actually like me.
* Laughter *

20
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.040
I would only add
David Hasselhoff.

21
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.560
Let's have a look then ...

22
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.760
Mr. Höller?
Yes?

23
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.040
Mr. Höller?
Yes?

24
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.760
I would come in now.
Ouch.

25
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.680
You do not need to respond to it,
that was just an announcement.

26
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.760
Okay. Not Okay!
I'm coming in now.

27
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.200
Period, end, out.
I am glad.

28
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.800
* Hum *

29
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.640
* Hum *

30
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.680
* Laughter *

31
00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.120
* Hum *

32
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.280
* Hum *

33
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.200
You're Höller, aren't you?
Yes.

34
00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.360
* Clearing throat *
* Laughter *

35
00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.440
Do you want a drink or do we
or are we going to start like this? A little water.

36
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.080
A silent one.

37
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.000
Can you open it yourself?
I don't have an opener. * (LAUGHING)

38
00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.920
Here, another cup.

39
00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.560
* Audience laughs. *

40
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.160
So, you are so...
Um, you are...

41
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.040
Motivational speaker, yes?
Yes.

42
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.680
Successful for 20 years.
30.

43
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.760
For 30 years, successful ...

44
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.960
Do you want...
What to drink you already have.

45
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.680
Good. If you are now a successful
Motivational Coach ...

46
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.920
Can you tell immediately whether people are
are successful or not?

47
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.440
In the past it was easily seen
on clothes,

48
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.080
certain accessories and attitude.

49
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.320
In the meantime, it is the case that, for example.
when people make a start-up ...

50
00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.000
You have a lot in Berlin.
* Audience laughs. *

51
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.080
Lots of startups. They come
in T-shirts and sneakers.

52
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.080
You can no longer see from the outside
who is successful. Okay.

53
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:37.720
As a success coach, do you only have
unsuccessful people around you?

54
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.200
You only have
with unsuccessful people.

55
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.560
On the one hand ...

56
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.600
On the one hand, it is the case that ...

57
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.840
For one thing, it's fun,
bringing people to the top.

58
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.400
Many young people
attend our seminars.

59
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.280
But we also have people,

60
00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.520
who are already successful and want to
want to go one step further.

61
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.040
This is my work. Good.
It's warm here, Mr. Krömer.

62
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.840
You do not have to be afraid. Please?
You have sweat on your brow.

63
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.400
I sweat even in winter.
I am not afraid.

64
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.560
He already slammed the door
the door next to me three times. Where?

65
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.240
In the dressing room. That was
a first attempt at intimidation.

66
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.200
Is this an attempt to be funny?
No.

67
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.480
Bit loose. Do you now have
unsuccessful people around you?

68
00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.200
No, we have people on the one hand,
who want to develop themselves further...

69
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.840
How's this: Let's say ...

70
00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.600
I always wanted to go to RTL,
but only made it to rbb.

71
00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.760
What am I doing wrong?
* (LAUGHING)

72
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:43.320
Visit first of all
a seminar with me.

73
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.640
Now runs this ...
What are you... Let me finish!

74
00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.240
(laughs) What is
the mindset of Kurt Krömer?

75
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.000
It was only enough
for the public broadcasters.

76
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.400
Have you been on RTL?
Yes.

77
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.360
Can you give me ...
I am afraid of hurting myself.

78
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.240
I have the table
broken anyway.

79
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.160
Great damage done.

80
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.800
The furnishings here
is still from the last show?

81
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.240
That's nice.

82
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.320
So ...

83
00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.840
For the people,
who do not know you yet ...

84
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.920
We take a look at an MAZ to get an
get an impression,

85
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.000
what you do during the day.

86
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.560
There we see
Your own private jet?

87
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.840
No, I rent it from time to time.

88
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.560
Is that supposed to
symbolize down-to-earthness?

89
00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:37.920
* Laughter *

90
00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.320
Now at work.
What are you doing?

91
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.520
I am on the stage ...
Looks like aerobics.

92
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.880
Is now also included. The
Jane Fonda of motivational coaches.

93
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.480
Something like this. Here, Halligalli!
We need movement.

94
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.760
Dance, clap and ...

95
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.280
Is this your private jet?
No.

96
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.480
But when I have business in Switzerland
and eight hours to get there ...

97
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.120
What do you do in Switzerland?
Seminar work. I see.

98
00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.080
Money? Please?

99
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.440
Take money to the bank?
* Laughter

100
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.480
* (LAUGHING)
No more.

101
00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.720
Can't do it anymore, huh?
It's simply a question of time.

102
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:21.560
If I had two days
to and from

103
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.200
and in half an hour
can fly there,

104
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.320
I can invest two more days
in my company.

105
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.000
A weighing of costs and benefits.

106
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.960
You need from Schweinfurt by
two days by train to Switzerland?

107
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.400
When you run.
One day arrival and one day departure.

108
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.080
Is there an airport in Schweinfurt
an airport?

109
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.080
* (LAUGHING)
Near Schweinfurt, yes.

110
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.600
How long do you fly
to Switzerland?

111
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.520
35, 40 minutes. That's not
not even that interesting.

112
00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.840
* (LAUGHING)
But tell me...

113
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.680
Let's say,
I've been through a divorce,

114
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.480
am in debt,
the wife is gone,

115
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.400
the children she has
thankfully left them with me.

116
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.240
I'm completely screwed. Mhm.
Then I go to you?

117
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.040
Yes, people also come,
who are at the very end.

118
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.960
Some have
a problem in one area.

119
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.400
Others are successful
and want to go one step further,

120
00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.760
because they
through continuing education and learning ...

121
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.720
From when can you ... Wait.
I'll ask the questions.

122
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:26.640
Let me finish,
otherwise...

123
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:31.200
We can also cut it so,
that you do not talk out at all.

124
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.840
We can do that.

125
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.480
Nevertheless, I would like to
tell something for the audience.

126
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.680
Which viewers?
The viewers at home.

127
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.480
Hopefully there are a few.
Are you all right? Yes.

128
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.360
Do you see spectators? Yes.
Then you are not well.

129
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.760
When can I
record the first successes?

130
00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:55.520
Some walk out of the seminar
and have an impulse,

131
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.400
to change something
and start doing so.

132
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:03.040
Some start the next day
with sports or losing weight

133
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.200
or to finally tackle a project or dream
finally tackle.

134
00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.640
Can the man afford it at all
afford, who is on the verge of ruin?

135
00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.120
With three, four children,
the wife is gone,

136
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.920
he may have
a drinking problem.

137
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:20.200
Can he afford your seminars?

138
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:24.120
A two-day introductory seminar
costs 49 to 99 euros.

139
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.640
Anyone can afford it.
How much? 49 to 99 euros.

140
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.400
For two days.
I see. We still have a VTR.

141
00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.760
We have looked at the prices
on your homepage.

142
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:40.520
Power Days ... Has become more expensive
in the last three seconds.

143
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.040
And lifting ... No, what?

144
00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.320
Lifing. Lifing. I thought..,
it was a lifting seminar.

145
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.040
There come then ...
These are the prices with asterisks.

146
00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.320
2,700 euros on top of that.
For how long?

147
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:58.880
People start with the Power Days

148
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:03.600
and can then decide whether they
do a continuation seminar.

149
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.440
People come first
to the Power Days.

150
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.680
That's VAT included.
There they dance and make so?

151
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.960
There dance for two days
10,000 people on the tables.

152
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.440
That's why we are so successful.
No, we make content.

153
00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.520
But we also have to offer
also have something to offer them.

154
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.760
It is a mixture
of continuing education and entertainment.

155
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:30.240
People have to have fun,
otherwise they won't learn.

156
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.880
I never enjoyed school,
I'm a school dropout.

157
00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:37.640
Oh, you have
no school education?

158
00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.640
A little bit.
What now? Two years or what?

159
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.240
Yeah, about that.
Second grade and then straight off?

160
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:49.360
After elementary school it was closing time.
Mhm, yes.

161
00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.120
After the tenth grade

162
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.320
I thought: Thank God
I don't have to study anymore.

163
00:10:55.480 --> 00:11:00.720
That was already question 47 of 30,
which we only ask today.

164
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.040
For example, when I'm
am really rocked down

165
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:08.640
and I'm not doing well:
Wouldn't therapy be better?

166
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:14.320
With the health insurance
one hour of therapy costs me nothing,

167
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.960
because it pays the insurance.

168
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:20.200
When it has to be fast
and I have private insurance,

169
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:22.200
it costs 120, 150 euros an hour.

170
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:26.000
After 5 hours a separation thing is
is completed, isn't it?

171
00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.880
Hopefully, you will then go ...
What were those? 2,700 euros?

172
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.080
That would be 27 private lessons.

173
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:36.240
That must have been a terrible
woman. * (LAUGHING)

174
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.840
Hopefully someone like that
to the therapist.

175
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.640
We do not work with sick
but with healthy people,

176
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:46.640
who want to learn mental motivation techniques
want to learn.

177
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.520
Someone who has been abandoned
is not sick.

178
00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.120
When he suffers
or has a trauma ...

179
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:56.920
Some suffer a lifetime
under a separation.

180
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.120
Then I am the wrong partner.

181
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:03.320
We have healthy people learning with us,
who have no trauma,

182
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.320
methods,
how they get ahead in life.

183
00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.520
And which of your participants ...
You've been doing this for 30 years.

184
00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:15.640
You must have
have coached thousands of people.

185
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.440
Yes, almost 1.8 million
1.8 million people? Mhm.

186
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.880
Which three of them are now

187
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:26.480
in the Forbes list of the richest
men and women in the world?

188
00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:31.160
Who took a seminar with you
took a seminar 30 years ago

189
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.280
and is now Bill Gates?

190
00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:35.480
After all...
Name three names.

191
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:40.240
Last year
three companies were coached by me,

192
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.160
among the 500 fastest growing
growing companies. Which?

193
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.480
I would have to ask my customers.

194
00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.480
One is, for example
Christian Schwendner.

195
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.200
Who is this? Christian Schwendner.
Schwendner? Yes.

196
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.600
The Schwendner? I do not know
whether it is the Schwendner.

197
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:01.480
The Bus-Schwendner? Among the 500
fastest growing companies.

198
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:05.320
Who the hell is Schwendner?
* (LAUGHING)

199
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.520
What does he have,
that grows so fast?

200
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.000
He repairs buses
all over Germany.

201
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.760
He could not repair buses,
went to you and now can?

202
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:21.240
No, but he can ...
Chapeau, Mr. Höller.

203
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.280
He can build it successfully.

204
00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:27.680
He is now in the Forbes list
of the richest men in the world? No.

205
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.640
His company
is one of the fastest growing ...

206
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.040
Why don't you name one?
No ...

207
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:35.960
So we still have something to laugh about.
* Laughter *

208
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.600
It is not about
that someone can do something.

209
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.440
No, that is
a prerequisite, isn't it?

210
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.040
Would all have success,
who can do something,

211
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.080
then my job would be superfluous.

212
00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.000
Unfortunately, this is not so.

213
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.720
Many people who
have a smaller business ...

214
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:55.680
Well, we don't want to get
get into the chitchat.

215
00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.600
I don't have to defend myself.

216
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.920
I have received 65,000 responses
from the 1.8 million.

217
00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.720
Yes. Do you have one with you?

218
00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.080
No, I was forbidden
to take anything with me.

219
00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.680
Why?
No things, no books ...

220
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.560
No firearms we said.
* (LAUGHING)

221
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:17.080
If you want to become a successful
Motivational Coach,

222
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.960
how do you get started?

223
00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:23.000
First very small as a
a shell player at Alexanderplatz?

224
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.600
This is the basic requirement ...

225
00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.720
No,
nowadays it's relatively easy,

226
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:32.600
by using, for example
making use of modern media.

227
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.080
You can get a lot of information on the internet, Instagram,
Youtube, podcasts and Facebook

228
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:42.480
transport its contents,
by putting them in.

229
00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:45.200
The people
watch and listen to it.

230
00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.120
If they like it,
they might buy a book,

231
00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.720
download a video
or attend a seminar.

232
00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:57.560
You have the Höller Academy,
where you send people off,

233
00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.440
who again bring in people
for these lifing seminars.

234
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.480
My company
has almost 100 employees.

235
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.320
We work with all ...

236
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.480
They get people
into these seminars?

237
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:16.160
Do you run some kind of pusher crew?
No, that's normal marketing.

238
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.600
Well, that's what they say when ...

239
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.320
Every company must
market itself. Of course.

240
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.440
I once gave a lecture
at a bishops' conference,

241
00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.880
with the provocative title
"Jesus was the first manager".

242
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:32.960
Even Jesus Christ
went out of his hut

243
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.200
and proclaimed the good news
of Christianity.

244
00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:41.080
No one comes to your company,
your workshop.

245
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:46.040
You have to get the message
to the world. Yes. Hallelujah.

246
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.320
So, we have another VTR.

247
00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.880
It is often just money-making:
One uses the mood at the seminar,

248
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.840
to quickly get people to
to book the next seminar.

249
00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
From the point of view of psychology
such seminars bring little success.

250
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:05.440
People book seminars all the time,

251
00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:08.600
because one becomes addicted
to this feeling of happiness.

252
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.800
It is comparable to feelings
that gambling addicts experience.

253
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.600
This dependency
is created here.

254
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.120
It benefits in the end
only the coaching provider,

255
00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.040
because he earns his money with it.

256
00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.960
* Laughter *

257
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.360
Well. What do you want to know?
Money-making, man.

258
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.560
Are you a bad person?
Who is that, anyway?

259
00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.280
This is Sabine Riede.
Yes.

260
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.680
She deals
with people,

261
00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.680
who, for example, are with Scientology and are
dissatisfied with the overall situation.

262
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.960
* Laughter * That is,
all training providers

263
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.880
create
an addictive structure?

264
00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:54.080
Okay, Mr. Höller.
We'll cut that together.

265
00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:57.640
They come across great.
(laughs) I think.

266
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.440
You have written many books.

267
00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.280
I have here four ...
seven books from you,

268
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:08.360
you give away.

269
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.440
Also, yes.
Don't the books have value?

270
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.160
I have sold 8 million books.

271
00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.880
Two of them
were bestsellers in Germany.

272
00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.480
Then I decided,
to give them away.

273
00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.200
You pay the shipping fee ...
That adds up to quite a bit.

274
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:27.480
(ironically) Yes, madness.

275
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.520
The messages in the books

276
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.280
also fit into a loose-leaf binder,
right? * (LAUGHING)

277
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.080
But when the ...

278
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:43.160
We put someone on it,
who read through them.

279
00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:48.600
He's in the psychiatric ward.
(LAUGHS) Yeah, yeah. * (LAUGHING)

280
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:52.600
He no longer has any desire to live.
The head of the psychiatric ward. No.

281
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.600
It's really ...

282
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.000
He wanted to jump off the bridge yesterday
with your books around his neck.

283
00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:00.640
* Laughter *

284
00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:04.520
And he yelled "I'm the best!"?
Of course.

285
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.600
If the contents
not work,

286
00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.960
no one would
would buy the next book.

287
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.200
I have been successful for 30 years. Yes.
I have also had crises.

288
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.360
We'll get to that in a minute.
Come on, we'll get to that in a minute.

289
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.160
It's not like people are stupid.

290
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:23.400
We always talk about vacation.

291
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:25.720
In a newspaper interview
you said,

292
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.080
You are
16 weeks a year on vacation.

293
00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.480
Seems to be going well.
12 to 16 weeks.

294
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.840
Life-work balance is important.

295
00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.760
I work hard and in between
you have to recover.

296
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.040
This is also a message,

297
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.440
that we want to convey to
want to convey.

298
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:49.760
16 weeks is already
a cowardly affair, respect.

299
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.840
Let's talk about ...
What does feist mean? Is there envy?

300
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.200
No, I admire you for that.

301
00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.760
I also want to take a 16-week vacation
vacation. Why don't you do it?

302
00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.000
Will do now. Our
conversation has already paid off.

303
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:07.200
Yes, wonderful.
I'm really motivated now.

304
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.080
* Laughter *

305
00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:14.240
Let's talk
about your huge vacation. Yes.

306
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:19.440
That was a mega bash, Höller has
a big Otto.

307
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.160
Even the Tagesschau reported.
Here is a MAZ.

308
00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.920
He was once
the star of motivational trainers

309
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.480
and filled concert halls,
his books were bestsellers.

310
00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:32.480
Today Jürgen Höller had to

311
00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.160
for misappropriation of company funds.
to stand trial for misappropriation of company funds.

312
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.560
A defendant pale as a corpse

313
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:42.040
and without the well-known victor's smile
appeared in court.

314
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.160
1.8 million marks he had
embezzled from his companies

315
00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:47.440
and used for private purposes

316
00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:52.200
and also concealed his assets in a
Swiss account.

317
00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:56.200
That weighed heavily and brought him today
a prison sentence.

318
00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.360
For three years
Jürgen Höller has to go behind bars.

319
00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:04.920
Then you will be familiar with
such an interrogation sounds familiar, doesn't it?

320
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.760
* Laughter *

321
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:09.600
Do you have deja-vus?
Unfortunately yes.

322
00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.880
No, that was ...
Three years in jail for embezzlement,

323
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:17.480
willful bankruptcy and false
affidavit. Mhm.

324
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.000
That was the end of Jucuzzi,
private jet and caviar, right?

325
00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:24.920
That was the low point of my life.

326
00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:29.440
For my mistakes
I have paid hard.

327
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.400
And unfortunately also my family,
my wife, my children.

328
00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:37.720
You have to know the background.
It was almost 20 years ago.

329
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:41.280
At that time I wanted
go public with a company.

330
00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.960
It was worth 0.5 billion
in the hype of the new market.

331
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.760
Then came the stock market crash and ...
Pillefitz.

332
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:52.960
550, 50 million? Screw it.
No, that was... Peanuts.

333
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:55.720
It wasn't peanuts,
it was a time,

334
00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:58.600
where due to the stock market crash
everything went wrong for me.

335
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.080
In the phase
I made terrible mistakes.

336
00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.720
It's been almost 20 years,

337
00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.760
today I am hopefully
a different person.

338
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:09.640
But in the panic
I was in at the time...

339
00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.480
Everything collapsed on me.

340
00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:17.120
I was younger 20 years ago, too.
Twenty years? I'm sure.

341
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:22.280
I have bathed it out
and started again in 2004 with ...

342
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:27.480
Say... Wait. With
6.6 million in debt and a ruined reputation.

343
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.920
Your interrogation is nothing
against the press at that time. Of course.

344
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:37.000
Man, you are driven like a pig
through the village, right?

345
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.280
Also rightly so.

346
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:43.120
I made mistakes
and took the mouth full.

347
00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:46.400
The nose too? Nose too.
* (LAUGHING)

348
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:49.600
That was Christoph Daum,
a good Freud.

349
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.000
In the 90s you were
most successful, weren't you?

350
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:57.640
Let me finish the story.
I forgot the question again.

351
00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:00.920
I'm on to the next one.
That's what the viewers are interested in.

352
00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:06.120
Are you seeing viewers again? If you see
see white mice, we abort.

353
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.840
No, Mr. Krömer ... Mr. Höller,
Mr. Höller, Mr. Höller.

354
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.840
Let me finish.
Feel free to touch me. Jeez!

355
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.040
If you are asked for advice
asked for advice as a motivational coach

356
00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.800
or is everyone the same?

357
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.680
It was different.

358
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:26.280
If you are a prominent person
there, you polarize strongly.

359
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.600
Some seek closeness,
others reject one,

360
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.880
because they believe
one is arrogant.

361
00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:36.080
The funniest thing was,
when one of the guards

362
00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.880
wanted an autograph,
but no one was allowed to see it.

363
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.160
Has there already been
A movie about it? * (LAUGHING)

364
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.480
No, but that's what you should do.
Yes, a two-piece.

365
00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:51.800
Shall we toast?
No, I have bumping phobia.

366
00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:58.280
In your book you write,
You found much comfort in the Bible

367
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:00.320
and masturbated a lot.

368
00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.280
Also.
* Laughter *

369
00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.840
But one thing at a time?
* Laughter *

370
00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:10.680
At that time I wrote
"Always get up again" ...

371
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:14.360
Oh, not the Bible!
No ...

372
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:19.560
I described in the book,
how the time was in there.

373
00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:23.280
That was allowed.

374
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:28.400
When they say that's a vacation:
Nonsense, this is traumatic.

375
00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:31.480
The first four weeks
I had no books,

376
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:33.960
no radio, no television.

377
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.920
Just a little Bible,
which the prison priest gave me.

378
00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:40.600
At 16 I had
as a catholic altar boy

379
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.840
lost faith in God.

380
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.280
I read the Bible
through twice out of desperation

381
00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:52.640
and pulled something out for me,
so that today I can say:

382
00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.320
Yes, Jesus is ...

383
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:57.200
I do not know
why people laugh then.

384
00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.840
Who is laughing?

385
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.320
"Höller's role models
are Arnold Schwarzenegger,

386
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.920
Steve Jobs and Jesus."
Then there is laughter.

387
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.600
I find the message
of charity is good.

388
00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:14.160
One should put this more into the world
and laugh less about it.

389
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:16.640
But everyone must know that for themselves.

390
00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:19.000
I'm not laughing.
No, no.

391
00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:23.920
You were a motivational coach,
taught people,

392
00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:26.800
how to be successful
and then are in jail.

393
00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.200
Were you ashamed?
Yes.

394
00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:34.360
But not for the fact
that I have failed,

395
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.160
but for the fact
that I made mistakes.

396
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:41.320
If you ask me today,
why I made the mistakes I did:

397
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.960
I was in a panic at the time,

398
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.720
there was still money in Switzerland,
of which no one knew anything ...

399
00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.480
What do you mean, it was just lying there? No,
I've had it for years...

400
00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:56.120
I have been successfully
successfully self-employed, or ...

401
00:24:56.280 --> 00:25:00.480
How did the money get to Switzerland?
I took it across with me.

402
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.480
And then forget about the deposit?
No, I still knew that.

403
00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:08.480
But I was
the only one in the company ...

404
00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.240
It was a big company
and worth 550 million no small thing.

405
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:17.480
We wanted to go public
and I was the only one privately liable.

406
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:23.160
I just kept my mouth shut and ...
Today I am ashamed of it.

407
00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.320
But I take responsibility
for this, can only apologize

408
00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.680
and try to use the rest
of my life to help people

409
00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.880
and make something positive
something positive out of my life.

410
00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.520
But you have also learned from it,
haven't you?

411
00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.160
You go on, one to one.
No, not one to one.

412
00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:47.520
You pull money out of your pockets,
but don't get caught?

413
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:50.320
Why pull from the pockets?

414
00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.920
We are
a commercial enterprise ...

415
00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:56.680
The public broadcasters
are pulling money out of their pockets.

416
00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:00.000
I have to pay my dues.
Do you have it with you?

417
00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.160
No ... Do you have it with you?
It will be debited from your account.

418
00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:08.040
And then goes to Switzerland.
Yes, or to Kurt Krömer.

419
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.040
I have to pay that.
But with us, no one is forced.

420
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.720
No one is forced
to go to Aldi,

421
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:18.400
to drive a BMW
and to attend a seminar with us.

422
00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:23.240
Why should I apologize,
that for an asset ...

423
00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.440
and I have 100 jobs ...

424
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.400
I don't understand.

425
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.360
I don't understand anymore right now either,
what that is supposed to

426
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.120
and which direction
this conversation is taking. Yes.

427
00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:38.200
You wanted to go public with
1 billion on the stock market?

428
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.040
Didn't a friend take you aside
a friend aside and asked:

429
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.360
"Höller, do you still have
all the blocks in the bag?"

430
00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.920
When banks like HypoVereinsbank,
WestLB and JPMorgan,

431
00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.600
what is today
is the largest bank in the world ...

432
00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.320
If they give the company
such a big rating

433
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:00.880
and it says 550 million in black and white,

434
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:04.840
should I then, as little Jürgen
Höller with medium maturity say:

435
00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.040
"I don't believe you?"
I wanted to believe it...

436
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.520
They screwed you.
No, they didn't.

437
00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.560
All companies,
that have survived from that time,

438
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:21.520
have been making minus for years and
invested in the future market.

439
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.720
Still happening.
Tesla is not making a profit ...

440
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.960
We're coming out now.
Uber doesn't make a profit either.

441
00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.560
Nevertheless, they are worth
billion on the stock market. Yes.

442
00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.760
Keep talking, I'm going out.
* (LAUGHING)

443
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.200
What do I do then? Please?
What do I do?

444
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.440
They're coming out now, it's over.
Oh, already?

445
00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.120
I go out with? Please?
I go out with?

446
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.920
Do you want to spend the night here?
I found it cozy.

447
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:49.200
Do you know where
I put the key? No.

448
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:54.080
Take a little distance.
Please go back.

449
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.720
* Laughter *

450
00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:59.080
Please wait. Say nothing.
Like 20 years ago.

451
00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.760
* Hum *

452
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.600
There you go.

453
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:07.800
Imagine ... Old memories
old memories come up. Yes, yes.

454
00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:11.440
(groans) What have we learned,
Mr. Höller?

455
00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.840
Apologize again.
* (LAUGHING)

456
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.760
Apologize
to all the people.

457
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.080
If you
said anything and then ...

458
00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:26.200
I don't want to get ent...
Say again that you ...

459
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.160
guilty of a crime
have been guilty of a crime.

460
00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:32.600
I care about ...
A convicted criminal.

461
00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:36.520
"As a standing here,
convicted felon,

462
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:38.280
I apologize."

463
00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.200
As standing here ...
Do not touch me.

464
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.560
As standing here, culpable ...

465
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.520
As standing here, guilty ...
Hand over.

466
00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:50.880
No, it's more important to me ...
Yes.

467
00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:54.320
The message that I
I pass on in my seminars:

468
00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.360
Every day
someone tells you ...

469
00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:01.200
Yes, we have ... You have assured me
a statement.

470
00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:04.120
We don't have all the time in the world.
But 30 seconds.

471
00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.960
No, the credits are already rolling.
* (LAUGHING)

472
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.680
I don't care.
What I say is more important.

473
00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.760
Praise be to Jesus Christ!
* Laughter *

474
00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.880
Take care, neighbors. Bye!
Bye. Ciao.
