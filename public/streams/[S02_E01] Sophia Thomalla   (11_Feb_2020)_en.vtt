00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.360
* Music *

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.400
* Cough *

4
00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.760
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

5
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.240
Sophia Thomalla: 30 years old,
1 million followers on Instagram.

6
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.720
That's quite an achievement.

7
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.480
One does not know at all,
what she does for a living,

8
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.440
but so many followers.

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.520
We'll clarify that with her in a moment.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.760
Mrs. Thomalla?
(Berlin dialect) What do you want?

11
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.280
Are you there yet?
I am already there.

12
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.440
We start now.
Then departure.

13
00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.320
One question, I just came:
Are you the daughter or the mother?

14
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.960
* Audience laughs. *

15
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.440
I am fine with both.
Okay.

16
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.160
Please put
your hands on the table,

17
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.880
so that I can see them.

18
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.440
Should I take off my clothes too?
No!

19
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.120
* Laughter *

20
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.240
I would come in now.

21
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.640
Oh, I've locked up.

22
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.960
* Hum *

23
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.160
Well? Hello.
My favorite turd.

24
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.920
Well, how are you?

25
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.200
Did you get me shitbratze ...
No, sit down.

26
00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000
What were you going to do?
Is this an interrogation?

27
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.760
Then I would
would also like a cigarette.

28
00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.160
Look...
No, you can't.

29
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.760
Why? You are not allowed
smoke on television.

30
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.080
Is that so? What happens then?
I am allowed to smoke.

31
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.000
Mhm. Because I ...
First of all, this is satire.

32
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.560
And because I'm a character.
* Laughter *

33
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.760
Now you're getting stressed.

34
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.120
Now there is real stress.

35
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.200
As a fictional character
I do not exist. I see.

36
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.040
Fix und Foxi, Porky Pig
and Kurt Krömer can smoke.

37
00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.080
Okay. Nothing will happen to us.

38
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.680
I don't have any internal organs.
I see.

39
00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
I don't even have a gender.

40
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.400
As little as we are allowed to smoke ...
It says "rbb" under my pants.

41
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.320
I brought us some eggnog.
Oh, great. In a chocolate cup.

42
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.040
The best gift for an alcoholic
alcoholic sober for ten years.

43
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.320
Really?
It's a thing.

44
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.600
Then I'll drink for you.
Drink this alone.

45
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.240
Can I drink anything else?
What do you want?

46
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.520
Wait ...
(laughs) You're not serious.

47
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.360
Yeah. They taped it off,
because of advertising.

48
00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.000
I have really been a
a dry alcoholic for ten years.

49
00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.120
Then I drink for myself alone.

50
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.240
I would then ...
* Audience laughs. *

51
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.680
Go ahead,
give me the bottle.

52
00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.560
Alright.

53
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.920
Where is the bottle?

54
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.880
Do you have anything else? No.
Chocolate or something?

55
00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.080
Chocolate? Here.
Look.

56
00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.080
Is that nice.
Drink everything alone.

57
00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.760
* Audience laughs. *

58
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.520
Do you need a straw
or party umbrella?

59
00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.960
* (LAUGHING)
Okay, let's get started, shall we? Good.

60
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.760
* (clears throat)

61
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.200
Ms. Thomalla, you are
an actress, according to Wikipedia,

62
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.920
Moderator, Model ... Yes.
The only thing missing is jewelry designer.

63
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.800
That only comes when I really
have nothing left to do.

64
00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.080
Did you really smoke any of that?
Yes, mhm.

65
00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.520
Your own Dirndl collection.
Do you have that?

66
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.520
That's what you do
when you know nothing more.

67
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.320
Do you have a Dirndl collection?
No.

68
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.680
But that's also what girls do,
who make jewelry design.

69
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.360
Okay, your last roles

70
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.240
you had with "Bergdoktor"
and "Die Dreisten Drei".

71
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.800
A long time ago.
What have you done since then?

72
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.720
I made a feature film
with Detlev Buck.

73
00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.600
Do we have a cutout?

74
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.720
No, but it's coming out
this year for Halloween.

75
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.920
Halloween is in October, right? Yes.
We now have the ...

76
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.080
Which one do we have today?
Today is Tuesday.

77
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.720
It's 10:00... * (LAUGHING)
The 10th is today.

78
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.520
No, the 11.

79
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.120
Okay, then the 11th
Today is Tuesday.

80
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.840
I've already had one.
What? I have already drunk.

81
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.080
* Laughter *

82
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.760
What is the name of the movie?
The movie is called ...

83
00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.160
That much is gross, right?
It's weird, yeah.

84
00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:03.800
But go ahead, come on.
Dare.

85
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.000
"Because they can't help it".
And what are you playing?

86
00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.280
Can you open this
open it with your fingernails?

87
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.920
* Laughter *

88
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.680
Uh...

89
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.640
Very good, cheers then.

90
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.640
Yes, cheers.
Here's to loosening up nicely.

91
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.880
Yes.
Are you drunk yet? No.

92
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.120
It takes ... Do you drink
a bottle like that every day?

93
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:32.200
Two.

94
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.840
Tastes great,
the Spreequell water. * Laughter *

95
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.480
I like the quiet one best.

96
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.560
The spider.
Here is also taped off.

97
00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.280
If the money is right,

98
00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.520
you would also moderate a colonic irrigation
too, wouldn't you? Um...

99
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.560
Or a gala by Jürgen Höller?

100
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.560
Yes, if the money is right ...
You did once.

101
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:04.840
By the way, greetings to Jürgen Höller,
who has become a good friend.

102
00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Is he? That is
the beauty of this show.

103
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.440
The guests come as guests
and leave as friends.

104
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.240
Okay, I see.

105
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.040
Did he throw coal at you?
Yes, he did. Drink some more.

106
00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.320
Mmm, he did.
But that does not taste good.

107
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.080
Like this.
* Clearing throat *

108
00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.080
They also do advertising,

109
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.400
z. e. g. Christmas 2017
for an online lottery portal. Yes.

110
00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:35.160
The one on the cross, mmm.

111
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.880
* Audience laughs. *

112
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.120
It's not obvious at first,
that it's about the lottery, huh?

113
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.800
* Laughter *

114
00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.960
No. No.

115
00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.240
The text: "Christmas
will now be even more beautiful."

116
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.960
Did no one notice,
that this is an Easter motif?

117
00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.720
It is, actually.
But didn't matter? Was no matter.

118
00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.880
"Take off your clothes, hang on the cross,
Merry Christmas!"

119
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.240
We took over
the campaign from Spain,

120
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.560
there they advertise
with Christian motifs.

121
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:07.280
At Christmas, at Easter.

122
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:13.120
El Gordo, a Spanish lottery.
That's where we took it from.

123
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.480
How long ago was this?
Three years?

124
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.960
2017, that should be three years.
Exactly.

125
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.120
Did you carry the cross
to the filming location yourself?

126
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.600
This was put in front of me and I was
was allowed to hang on it for two hours.

127
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.800
Well, good.

128
00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:37.400
Many got upset,
especially the church.

129
00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.960
But that's not really shocking.
A little water in between ...

130
00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:45.280
Hey, don't get it mixed up.

131
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:49.280
This is with action in the mouth.
This is with, this is without?

132
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:54.080
After all, there is only pink and blue.
One is with, the other without.

133
00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:00.520
Did you answer the question?
What did you want to know?

134
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.560
Many got upset,
especially the church.

135
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:07.120
But that doesn't really shock you.
Not me anyway.

136
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.360
If I let myself
naked to be nailed to the cross,

137
00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:15.360
Does that shock? Should it be shocking?
No, not really.

138
00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:19.760
But people were shocked.
But I'm used to that.

139
00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.760
And why are you doing this?
Because of headlines in Bild?

140
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:29.840
The headlines are everywhere.
Always this "Why do this?"

141
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.240
I do advertising,
and it can be provocative.

142
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.040
The point of an advertisement is, after all,
is that people discuss it.

143
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.680
That they discuss or say:

144
00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:44.760
"Oh, nice commercial,
it's about crosses, I'll buy it"?

145
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.200
After all, it's not about buying,
It's about playing the lottery.

146
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:52.280
Has been solved what this has to do with
to do with the lottery numbers on the cross?

147
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:55.200
Ey, this has been resolved.
Did you say Ey?

148
00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.120
What if I say Ey again?

149
00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:01.960
I don't know, then I'll hit you
the bottle of eggnog over your head.

150
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.920
How much
do you earn on Instagram?

151
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.040
Nothing at all.
You have 1 million followers.

152
00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.520
How much do you earn per month? I
don't make my money with Instagram.

153
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:17.720
Then what are you doing it for?
You are doing it too.

154
00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.960
Well, I make millions.
* Audience laughs. *

155
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.720
Are you doing this for free? All those
All those crappy reports about your food...

156
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:30.040
If you earned millions, you wouldn't have to
you wouldn't be sitting here with me right now.

157
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.600
I'm just bored.

158
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:37.200
When the account is full of ash,
it is also boring.

159
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.080
I said, "Come on, let's play
TV show." Mmm.

160
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.440
And now you're here.
All right.

161
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:46.440
Are you bored right now?
A little bit.

162
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.360
What should we do?
Party games?

163
00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:52.240
It's the booze, isn't it?
I have to drink alone.

164
00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:55.000
Since I stopped drinking,

165
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:59.080
I always stand around with a water
and then I'm considered sick.

166
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.240
Really?
You've lost weight too. Suits you.

167
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.000
Well, it was liposuction.
No, not true.

168
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.640
25 kilo
I have at home in the refrigerator,

169
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.120
that I let
in the ass can be injected.

170
00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.560
When you lose weight,
the ass is flat.

171
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.400
That's where the legs come out of the back.
The legs come out of the back?

172
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:24.600
Maybe I'll have my lips injected
two kilos to have my lips injected.

173
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.960
I have
so much fat in the refrigerator.

174
00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:29.280
Chicken broth I made. Mmm.

175
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.440
What?
* (LAUGHING)

176
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.160
God is up there.

177
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.560
At one point, things really took off.
Yes?

178
00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:44.600
In 2016 you posted:
"Small tits are like refugees:

179
00:10:44.760 --> 00:10:47.800
They are there,
but no one wants them."

180
00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.080
That was
our friend Micky Beisenherz.

181
00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.720
You did it with Beisenherz?
No, him alone. How?

182
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.800
He had access to your account?
Exactly.

183
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:02.640
For his show
he had access and uploaded that.

184
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:07.640
Did you delete it again? No,
It was still there for quite a while.

185
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:10.200
But it was deleted.
Yes, of course.

186
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.040
So it was deleted.
Yes, but not immediately.

187
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.200
It was in, but it was deleted.
Yes, but not immediately.

188
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.000
What is no longer there ... It makes
no sense to delete it immediately.

189
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:23.800
It went anyway ...
Were you scared? No, why?

190
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.600
Did not say the AfD:

191
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.280
"Great post,
Thomalla is one of us!"?

192
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:32.400
I don't give a shit about that.

193
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.760
But I was not afraid.

194
00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.120
I could have pointed the finger
at Micky Beisenherz:

195
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.960
"You asshole, what did you do?"

196
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.680
But I was there
and gave him my access.

197
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.080
If, then we both go
through hell.

198
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:50.400
Ah, Kurti.

199
00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:56.240
We now come to the topic
Machos and equality.

200
00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.200
You like to provoke. Mhm.

201
00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.960
We have such a ...

202
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.560
We have a clip from 2012.

203
00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:09.000
What. My last relationships
were all Susi's.

204
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.080
My very first boyfriend did not,

205
00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.120
but after that I only had Susis.

206
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:17.880
I realized
that I'm not into that anymore.

207
00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.360
I always either cheated
or run away.

208
00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.640
One of the two was always the case.

209
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:28.040
I was extremely bored with that.

210
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:31.920
I just knew
that I could do what I wanted.

211
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.680
That made it
somehow unattractive.

212
00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.080
Yes, it's the same.
Say a little more.

213
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.280
I wonder,
how I looked in 2012.

214
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.840
How old were you then? Twelve?
Can I have a go now?

215
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.520
You are not a fictional character,
but a real woman on Insta,

216
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.640
that doesn't even make coal.

217
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:56.040
Do you make any money at all? Yes.
Can I lend you some? Not here.

218
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.760
That's why I have to
I have to drink it up. Yeah, right.

219
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:06.120
Currently you are with the footballer
goalkeeper Loris Karius.

220
00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:11.080
Is he a Lady or a Tramp?
No, he's not a Susi.

221
00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:15.600
Can you explain offside?
Offside? In one sentence.

222
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.160
There can be as many as two.
But not three.

223
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:23.040
Offside is when ...
I know what offside is.

224
00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:26.920
But explaining that is difficult.
Offside is when ...

225
00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.400
Can I explain this with glasses
and bottles? Yes.

226
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.800
So: Schalke against Dortmund.

227
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.920
Schalke player plays here,
one there, a Dortmund player here.

228
00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.480
Ball ... When he wants to pass
and here is the goal,

229
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:49.640
the player is allowed by his own club

230
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.240
not stand in front of the player
stand in front of the player of the opposing team.

231
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:57.760
That's offside. If they are on the same
If they are on the same line, no, otherwise it is.

232
00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.440
I always thought offside ...

233
00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:04.320
* Laughter *

234
00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:09.200
A player
is offside ...

235
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:10.880
* Laughter *

236
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.360
Hold the cardboard straight!
Now it's blown!

237
00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:20.120
Jesus, you also
your fingers on it!

238
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:24.000
I'm about to smack you.
What are you doing?

239
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.400
Now I look stupid,
can't even explain offside.

240
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:31.080
I can't even compare it
with your statement.

241
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.800
For this you know the rules of handball.
A player finishes ...

242
00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.160
* Laughter *

243
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.200
I'll punch you in the face, for real.

244
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.120
* Laughter *

245
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:45.840
A player
is offside ...

246
00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.800
I can't even read it
when it's so dense.

247
00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.560
... when it is closer to the opponent's
goal line than the ball

248
00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.840
and the penultimate counterpart.

249
00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.720
Including goalkeeper.

250
00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:02.520
I have explained it better.

251
00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.240
You needed bottles for that.
Yes, that's right.

252
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.440
Anyway, screw it. Mhm.

253
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:12.840
Let's cross out, we have not
explained. What? I have explained.

254
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.680
In 2015, you gave real substance
on "Hart aber Fair" and said:

255
00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.200
"If you're a woman and you want equality
and against sexism,

256
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.040
has obviously never
ever received a compliment."

257
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:27.680
Are you happy
about every compliment? Yes, I am.

258
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:30.520
Depends.

259
00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.240
What was the excitement there?
I still ask myself that today.

260
00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.560
What kind of letters did you receive?
I have not received any letters.

261
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.120
Being shielded, huh?
I am not being shielded by anyone.

262
00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:46.280
Have you become smaller?
(laughs) No.

263
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.640
Are you sitting or standing?
I sit.

264
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.400
I'm not that small.
You were just smaller.

265
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.240
Really?
Do we have electric chairs today?

266
00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.840
So ...

267
00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:01.480
We have that tweet there.
Mmm.

268
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.520
Yes. Like this.

269
00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:07.400
(Krömer reads aloud.)

270
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.840
Who is provoked by this now?

271
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.600
Uh...

272
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:20.040
Probably the woman who
actually just standing in the kitchen.

273
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.680
I don't know, I don't know.
I think it's funny, still.

274
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:28.400
Do I have to imagine it like this:

275
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.280
You are at home, waiting for
your husband Lorius Karius Baktus ...

276
00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.520
and make sure
that the pudding is nice and warm ...

277
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.280
I actually cook.
Yes? Yes.

278
00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.920
But is he such a ...

279
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:47.760
That reminds me
of grandma and grandpa back then. What?

280
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.280
This image of women: The woman has
made beautiful pudding at home ...

281
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:55.280
There's nothing wrong with that.

282
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:58.320
I can still be
be Sophia Thomalla, travel around

283
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.320
and on my days off
stand in the kitchen.

284
00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.360
One does not exclude the other.

285
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.320
Wait a minute, look.

286
00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.360
* Music *

287
00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.760
Yes, a woman has two questions of life:

288
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.520
What should I wear?
And: What should I cook?

289
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.800
It's amazing what a man can
can eat when he is married.

290
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.640
Apparently
appetite also comes with marriage.

291
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:27.040
Yes, and the most important thing for him
is the pudding.

292
00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.120
Right. You know:
Men who like to eat sweets,

293
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:31.880
have a good character.

294
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.440
Confusingly similar, isn't it? Yes.
It's like you guys. Totally.

295
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:44.360
The feminists get upset,
the men jerk off

296
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:46.920
and the Bild
has a nice headline.

297
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.720
Everything explained in one sentence.

298
00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Why do so few women
see your position? Um...

299
00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:58.160
Did you blow into it?
Everything here is full of ash.

300
00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:02.800
(laughs) I'm not even allowed to smoke.
Because you're not a fictional character.

301
00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.600
Drink some more eggnog.
It's no fun out of the cup.

302
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.240
Why do so few women see this
position that you take?

303
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.680
Well, because ...

304
00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:20.760
I think that feminism is
misconceived by some women.

305
00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.840
People always deny me
that I am a feminist.

306
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.560
I think,
that's pretty unfair.

307
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.960
Just because I joke,
like to wear and say what I want,

308
00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.560
I am denied
that I am a feminist.

309
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.440
That's bullshit.

310
00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.120
A feminist has spoken out
Christine Kurmeyer, has commented on this,

311
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.240
first chairwoman
of the Women's Council Berlin. Okay.

312
00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:50.120
Who is Ms. Thomalla?

313
00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:54.720
Sorry,
the image of women in this statement

314
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.320
is completely anachronistic,

315
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.200
borrowed from the 50s.

316
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.560
I can't take that seriously at all.

317
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.480
Such people
are not good role models,

318
00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.120
because they reproduce something
what has long since become old-fashioned

319
00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.320
and has gone out of fashion.

320
00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.280
For those who deal with the
role of women,

321
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:17.520
this is completely undiscussable.

322
00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:21.880
Man, then we must
immediately stop with such posts.

323
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.560
Don't we do that anymore?
Yes, all the more so.

324
00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:28.280
Was the goal to make her angry?
Not at all.

325
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:31.880
Actually, everyone is served:
Men who are into it,

326
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:35.600
that the woman is in the kitchen,
she is served...

327
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:39.800
The worst thing
about this thing is:

328
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.800
If you don't put a
winking smiley behind it,

329
00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:45.800
everyone takes it at face value.

330
00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:49.760
Of course, I'm not serious about all the crap
that I post, not seriously.

331
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.560
No?
Of course not. Too bad.

332
00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:55.440
Although I
actually like to stand in the kitchen.

333
00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.680
It's okay to say that.
Is it okay to say that in public?

334
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.360
Of course. Yes?
Yes, I like to cook for my friend.

335
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.400
Not that you
into the shit.

336
00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:11.320
And he doesn't even bring
his dishes back to the kitchen.

337
00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.920
Even that I take back
into the kitchen and wash it off.

338
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.720
However, I find that ...

339
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:22.160
And then you clean the kitchen
and do the laundry.

340
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.200
Yeah, sure. That too?
Yes, I do that too.

341
00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:28.840
I also like ironing. Yes?
Ironing totally relaxes me.

342
00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.600
Does he do anything?
At home?

343
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:34.920
He can't, the training
is exhausting. That's how it is.

344
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.160
Today I can
no longer wash either.

345
00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.280
He does not
and he doesn't have to.

346
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:43.440
So, we come
to Merkel and the CDU. Mhm.

347
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.440
You are a CDU member.
For seven years or so.

348
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:50.080
Why? How, why?

349
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.880
* Laughter *

350
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.800
Why not? Why?
I like them.

351
00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:59.360
Seven years ago you were 23. Mhm.
What's going wrong there?

352
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.280
What do you mean?

353
00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:06.320
Why did you say:
"The CDU, that's where I have to go.

354
00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.160
They are people like you and me,
that's where I go!"?

355
00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:14.720
I am interested in politics.
But not for those of the CDU.

356
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:19.040
I like Dr. Merkel.
You say Frau Dr.?

357
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.040
She is a good politician

358
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.800
and can not be
out of the calm.

359
00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:27.360
She does not have to constantly
rattle the chain,

360
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.160
but has remained on the ground
and does not allow itself to be distracted.

361
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.000
I think she's good.
When she is no longer in office,

362
00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.200
we only know
what we had in her.

363
00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.520
It won't be long now.
That's right.

364
00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.440
How much do you pay?
I do not know.

365
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.120
I turned something off.
Ah.

366
00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.800
With the CDU
you have to be careful, otherwise ...

367
00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.880
Do you have a transfer order?
"Take what's there."

368
00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.000
You actually decide for yourself
how much you pay.

369
00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:59.560
Merkel and you have
met a few times. Mmm.

370
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.440
Yes. What was there?
Schnitzel with potato salad.

371
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.240
What's in the jar?
Friedrich Merz's brain?

372
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.600
No, that was...
Oh God, what was that?

373
00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.360
That was before
a salad in a glass.

374
00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.360
And then what do you talk about?

375
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.360
About the new girlfriend of the Wendler?
What are the topics?

376
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.000
They didn't even exist then.
(laughs) Was she already born?

377
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:34.160
When was the picture?
Oh, it's so young. Yes.

378
00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:36.640
How old is she?
No idea.

379
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.080
18, but he has already been
with her for eight years?

380
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.160
* (LAUGHING)
I do not know.

381
00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:47.680
Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer
is now throwing in the towel.

382
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:52.120
Was that a big shock for you
or did you not know who it was?

383
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.120
This was not a big shock to me.

384
00:22:58.280 --> 00:23:02.520
I was counting on it.
Yes? Mhm.

385
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:07.000
Would you run as a candidate for chancellor for the
for the CDU?

386
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.920
Oh God, poor Germany.
Poor Germany.

387
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.120
Wouldn't you like to?
Do that to people as well?

388
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.800
Then you would
finally earn some money.

389
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.360
Then something would come in.
I know.

390
00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:21.840
You need to use that more.
I know

391
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.680
More Instagram, you say.
Yes, more advertising.

392
00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.040
Would you like to
take over my account?

393
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.520
But then nothing is deleted,
okay?

394
00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:33.800
You may also quiet times with me ...

395
00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.320
You also like to tell stories.
I like to follow you, by the way. Yes?

396
00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:39.360
Yes. Ah. Yes.

397
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:44.480
Have you ever written anything?
Yes, now and then. Can't you see?

398
00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.160
That's what your social media team does.
Yes, a team of 150.

399
00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:51.320
* I'm sending
ten pictures to my management

400
00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.120
and they put authors to work.

401
00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:56.960
Videos you send too. The
I have the advertising money transferred to me.

402
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.240
You upload conversations.
You're doing a good job. Yes? Yes.

403
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.600
Beautiful, thank you.

404
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.960
At my age, huh?

405
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:07.960
45 are you, right?
Yes, 45.

406
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:12.160
You've done well.
Thanks, but is all fake.

407
00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.440
What all?
Liposuction. Oh, right.

408
00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:18.520
Toupee. Also?
Yes, for four years.

409
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.920
Eyelid lift already?
Yeah, sure. Really?

410
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:25.120
I have threads in here everywhere.
Crass.

411
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:29.120
When I raise my arms,
I laugh. * Laughter *

412
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:32.720
When you close your mouth,
the asshole opens. Exactly.

413
00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.760
You can use that when watching TV
from time to time. Yes.

414
00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:37.560
* Laughter *

415
00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:41.280
Do we have Merkel now?
We do, too.

416
00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.120
Tell me,
is Karrenbauer a Susi?

417
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.920
I wonder if this is a Susi?

418
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.960
We were talking
about men and Susi.

419
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.680
She is also a Susi,
has nothing under control.

420
00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.640
I find Susi
a beautiful term for men.

421
00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.280
Is that a nice term?
Well, to describe.

422
00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.280
I thought: "Fuck off,
you're a Susi!"

423
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.800
You are a Susi,
don't drink with me.

424
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.360
You're not an alcoholic at all.
A dry one.

425
00:25:11.640 --> 00:25:14.480
I'm an alcoholic, but I'm sober.
Really?

426
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.160
At the last Handball World Cup
we drank together.

427
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.000
When. Last year.
What did we drink?

428
00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.240
Hmm.
* Laughter *

429
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.040
Go ahead and say it. You've been drinking,
I've been taking trips.

430
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.920
You know?
I'm not stupid.

431
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:34.080
No, I can't drink.
Good, Mrs. Thomalla.

432
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.440
Then the file ends already now.
Mhm.

433
00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.120
We're going out for a bit.
Do you want to have another drink?

434
00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:44.880
Well, at the very end ...

435
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.080
Come on, Susi.

436
00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.600
Alright.

437
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.760
What is it? Do you eat it?
Actually yes.

438
00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.040
But they are a bit thick.

439
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.000
Did you tape that off?
No, your team. First take it off?

440
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.320
We can immediately
write the invoice.

441
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:12.160
It doesn't say anything.
So, we're going out, come on.

442
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.400
I have you here still ...

443
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:22.040
* Laughter *

444
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:25.200
A gift. Thank you.
For the kitchen. May I?

445
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.680
Stand here for a minute,
we're gonna do the graduation thing.

446
00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:30.760
I have always wished for something like that.

447
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.360
This belongs only to you,
not your husband.

448
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.680
You are a strong woman.
You can use it alone. Thank you.

449
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.160
For me you are
the woman of the year.

450
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.520
So. You were the daughter, right?
I was the daughter.

451
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.640
Ladies and gentlemen,
Thank you to Sophia Thomalla.

452
00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.800
* Applause *
Gladly.

453
00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.800
If you want,
you can still ...

454
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.680
say that you're going to be
Chancellor or something.

455
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.160
Keep it higher,
so that you can see it well.

456
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.600
I don't want to be chancellor.
That's all right.

457
00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.240
You won't become chancellor like that.
I don't want to!

458
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.800
You have to make an effort.
I don't want to be chancellor.

459
00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.720
Sophia Thomalla
sets herself up to become chancellor.

460
00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.560
We cut it so,
that it fits for you.

461
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:24.720
I don't think it's a good idea,
because she is still very young.

462
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:28.360
But she has her own head
and needs her space.

463
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:30.920
Too young,
but too old for the Wendler.

464
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.480
Right.
Take care, neighbors. Bye!

465
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.400
* Applause *

466
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.200
Uh...

467
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:42.480
* Applause stops. *

468
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.560
Do we have it in the can or do
we do it again with the mother?

469
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.320
* Laughter *

470
00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:52.920
(man) We are very fine.
Good.

471
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.320
Thank you,
that's it.

472
00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.800
By the way, the show comes tomorrow,
on 11.2. That was perhaps ...

473
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.960
What?
a bit stupid.

474
00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:09.680
Is yet a recording
for tomorrow, 11.2.

475
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:12.920
So you know!
What do we have today?

476
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.000
Today is Monday.

477
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.360
We record,
is not live.

478
00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.280
So, for rbb, this is live,
because it comes 38 hours later.

479
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.800
Ah, the 10th.
Now I get it.

480
00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.920
We have recorded this
with cameras. All right.

481
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:31.320
Take it away, don't,
that it gets into my picture.

482
00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.280
I thank you all.
Take care, thank you!
