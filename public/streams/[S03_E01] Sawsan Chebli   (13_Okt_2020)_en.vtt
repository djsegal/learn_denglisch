# You are the one for me, for me

Sawsan Mohammed Chebli,

for civic engagement

and International Affairs of the Berlin
State Chancellery. * Clearing throat *

10
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.240
Tritt in the constituency
Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf

11
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.160
for the SPD for the Bundestag election
against Michael Müller.

12
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.280
Cardigans-Müller,
you may know.

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.080
* slurps *
Ah!

14
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.040
Ms. Chebli are you already in place?

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:51.920
I am there, yes.

16
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.800
I hear them badly.

17
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.000
Maybe it's the sound,
I don't know. I am there.

18
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.640
Lukas is making sound today,
so it's going like crap.

19
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.160
This is an internal one, you don't
not need to further tangent.

20
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.800
Uh, Ms. Chebli.

21
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.120
Yes?

22
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.680
You're from the SPD, aren't you?
Looks like it, yes.

23
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.080
It showed
from the past,

24
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.520
that SPD politicians
like to stumble from time to time.

25
00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.320
I have seen it, yes.

26
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:24.920
I will not ...
And already coped with?

27
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.040
When I ask,
you can answer then.

28
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.320
All right, I'm glad.

29
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.480
Mr. Krömer!

30
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.520
Do you smoke?

31
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.400
Um, hookah.

32
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.160
Mh, cool.
Do you have there, 'ne?

33
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.360
(sings) Better leave Shisha bar,
Shisha bar.

34
00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.400
I know it.
Like this!

35
00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.040
* (clears throat)

36
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.920
* Door buzzer *

37
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.520
Do you keep closed from the inside?

38
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.880
Oh no, it was locked.

39
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160
So, Ms. Chebli.

40
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.200
Do you have your hands ...

41
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.280
All right.
Must be right because of security.

42
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.680
Do it, please.
I think that fits. Thank you.

43
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.920
Yes, Ms. Chebli, this is now my first
my first program under Corona.

44
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.760
Will you be okay or do you want
anything else? - Go, all good.

45
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.720
Have you had any television appearances
before, um, during Corona?

46
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.960
Yes, some.

47
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.120
But this,
I have not had anything like this.

48
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.720
Do you want a drink or
do you drink the disinfectant?

49
00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.400
Nah, it'll fit.

50
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.240
Are you there now ...
they are afraid of catching

51
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.880
or do you do tests?

52
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.720
Silent or ...
Silent. - ... or with action?

53
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.520
Silent would be good.
There will be enough action later.

54
00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.840
Um, yeah, I'm careful.

55
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.320
I wear mask,
keep the safe distance and ...

56
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.120
Now I have with bubbles.

57
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.920
Turn with your finger until the bubbles are out,
until the bubbles are out.

58
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.480
Do not touch me.
Only the bottle.

59
00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.800
Do they take their hands off?
All right.

60
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.760
Do not touch!
It's okay.

61
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.400
Man.

62
00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.040
Safety is
is a top priority here.

63
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.360
Is that in Turkish?
Turkish hand water, you want?

64
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.000
Nah, it's good.

65
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.400
So, Ms. Chebli.
* Clearing throat

66
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.320
Berlin is a risk area, new
new contact restrictions apply.

67
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.640
There is a closing time.
Is that enough?

68
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.160
Hopefully
people stick to it.

69
00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.640
Sad that we had to reintroduce
had to introduce measures.

70
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.520
That not all
have followed the rules.

71
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.400
Shit, that all suffer from it,
because a few don't participate.

72
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.280
What do you have on anyway,
Leather, awesome. - Yes.

73
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.960
Wow! - I think so too.

74
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.560
Are you a motorcycle freak or something?
Nah, not at all.

75
00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.880
I am also afraid of driving,
but like leather.

76
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.440
Hm. May I write that down?
You may, yes.

77
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:14.040
Mag leather.

78
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.560
So, pay attention,
it's not super,

79
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.880
to have such a mayoral titan
as Michael Müller on board?

80
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.600
The rock of us all
in the surf. - Yes.

81
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.800
I think he's doing a
a good job for himself.

82
00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.040
I'm on parental leave, so
I don't really get it,

83
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.840
how the measures are going.

84
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000
On parental leave you have no
TV and radio is turned off.

85
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.040
I have not had my
my TV on for 4 months,

86
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.040
because the little one is there.
Newspaper also abolished?

87
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.400
I only come to Kurt Krömer...
Internet turned off?

88
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.120
No information?
I don't get anything.

89
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.560
Do you know what day it is?
Nope.

90
00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.400
What day is today?

91
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.880
Tuesday.

92
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.880
No, honestly,
for me, every day is the same.

93
00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.520
You know that it will be
will be aired.

94
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.320
You've got a lot of nerve, Ms. Chebli.

95
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.840
And they want
now into the Bundestag

96
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.480
and are competing, of all things
against political titan Michael Müller

97
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.960
in the constituency of Charlottenburg-
Wilmersdorf constituency. What's the point?

98
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.160
It's not me against him,
but he against me.

99
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.280
I already said in 2019,
that I wanted to be in the Bundestag,

100
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.400
in Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf.

101
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.720
Now we are both there to see
what the members decide.

102
00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.360
With you politicians ...

103
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.200
I think it sucks
that everyone says I'm against him.

104
00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.640
You can't say: I think he sucks
I think he sucks and I'm going to get rid of him.

105
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.920
That's not the point, whether
I think he sucks or not.

106
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.160
Do you think he sucks? - Nope, otherwise
I wouldn't work for him.

107
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.160
Working against him now yes.
No, not against him.

108
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.280
That is not against him,
but it is about that,

109
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.520
that hopefully these
2500 members get this.

110
00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.600
This?
That they are then so convinced ...

111
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:05.440
You hope now,
that this is your springboard?

112
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.560
That's the only reason I said yes.

113
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.320
They need to get out of parental leave,
they don't know what's going on. - Yes.

114
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:15.960
Do nothing else,
is it the only one?

115
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:17.600
I only do Bundestag.

116
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.520
You come to Chez Krömer
and everything runs by itself?

117
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.680
Do you think
I'll help you with that?

118
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.000
I hope to walk out of here
and be satisfied.

119
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.200
That's campaigning,
what you do, right? - Yeah, sure.

120
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.600
Now everyone has to
somehow find you great and say:

121
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.120
It's great,
I'll put my cross there.

122
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.400
Not all,
only 2500 SPD members for the time being.

123
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.440
4 years ago you brought
Michael Müller to the Senate Chancellery.

124
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.080
How did it come about?

125
00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.520
I think he was looking for a good
Secretary of State and asked around

126
00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.280
and asked Frank-Walter Steinmeier,
today's president,

127
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.520
and Ehrhart Körting,
then Senator of the Interior, and so on,

128
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.760
and they said:
It's good, take it.

129
00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:02.200
Now they are competing against him.
I am not competing against him!

130
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:05.840
That's a beautiful thing ...
If, then he competes against me.

131
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.480
A great way ...

132
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.680
Can you hear me through the glass?

133
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.800
A great way,
to say thank you.

134
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:15.280
He gets you into the Senate office,
now you're running against him.

135
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.200
You don't mob him out,
but you want to win.

136
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.640
This has nothing
to do with gratitude.

137
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.680
We are both in the SPD.
There is no gratitude?

138
00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.680
However ... - Gratitude
in the SPD is something we do not know,

139
00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.320
we don't start with that.

140
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.080
I am grateful
that I am Secretary of State.

141
00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.720
I also delivered.

142
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.920
If I had sucked,
he could have kicked me out.

143
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.600
But I delivered.

144
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.240
Yeah, cool picture, right?

145
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:42.240
Shows everything.

146
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.720
This looks
like married 40 years

147
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.600
and he never did the dishes.

148
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.200
I believe,
that was in the Bundesrat or where?

149
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.320
You are both in a bad mood.
Have you been bickering?

150
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.240
I don't know what was there again.

151
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.920
He was probably
again about my Twitter.

152
00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.560
Does he have Twitter? Does he know how to use it?
Yes, he does now.

153
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.400
I think he doesn't do it
not himself, but has.

154
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.200
In your candidate letter
you write that you were surprised,

155
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.240
that Michael Müller
for Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf

156
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.040
is running for the Bundestag.
Why surprised?

157
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.160
I thought that if he
wants to run for the constituency,

158
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.920
he would contact me beforehand.
But he did that only 1 day before.

159
00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.040
That's why I was a little surprised.

160
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:28.000
But Michael Müller
is in the SPD and they are ...

161
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:31.120
Also in the SPD.
... also in the SPD, yes.

162
00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:33.760
Don't people talk to each other there?

163
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.960
I would have wished that we had
talked to each other beforehand.

164
00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.440
Now it is not so.
But what is it about?

165
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.320
It's about getting this constituency back for the
constituency back for the SPD.

166
00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.960
He is with the CDU.

167
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.720
It's about which one of us
is elected by the members,

168
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.360
who is more convincing?

169
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.600
Who convinces people,
that he is the one,

170
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:57.560
who will take back this constituency
- him or me?

171
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.800
He is not my opponent.

172
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.040
It's a question of how we
SPD get this constituency back.

173
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.960
How do you convince now?

174
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:10.360
You mean now in the preliminary phase
or afterwards? - In general.

175
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.560
Why should I say,
Ms. Chebli is now ...

176
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.800
Bomb the woman, I'll take it.

177
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:19.040
I think if you look at
where the SPD stands right now,

178
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.360
there is nothing to suggest
that we can go on with "business as usual".

179
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.400
somehow get above 17%, right?

180
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.000
I don't think
that I am the typical ...

181
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.320
Keep above 10,
it would be bomb.

182
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:32.160
I think,
we won't do worse than 15.

183
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.880
You're at 15 now, right?

184
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.440
Yes, I think
it won't get any worse.

185
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.400
14.8 or so.

186
00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:42.920
But I believe
that we need new impetus.

187
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.960
We need people who speak plain
speak plainly, are passionate.

188
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.280
I have the feeling
that I can do that.

189
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.280
I stand for a message.

190
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.840
Look at,
how many with a migration background

191
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.840
are at the top.
None.

192
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.880
No one in this federal government
is not white.

193
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.400
With me we would
send a message,

194
00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.320
that the country has learned
from the past,

195
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:08.640
that we are ready
for someone with my biography,

196
00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.600
that we are courageous.
I cause a stir, I polarize.

197
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.240
Not everyone loves me.

198
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.880
You stand
for the dynamic Berlin?

199
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.400
Yes, it is.
But... I am young...

200
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.280
Anyone who competes against Müller,
is the dynamic Berlin.

201
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.240
I wouldn't see it that way, no.

202
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.640
There are also many who tick like him
like him and who vote for him.

203
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:31.320
He has his supporters,
otherwise he wouldn't be doing this.

204
00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:34.280
Will not
every mayor in Berlin

205
00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.080
always chased from the yard at the end?

206
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.120
Wowereit was not chased from the court.

207
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.520
He left
because of the airport.

208
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:44.960
... the airport.
Was already a Cooler.

209
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.280
Do we know anything?
Oh no, they are ...

210
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.080
Is there an opening...

211
00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.720
I am on parental leave
and have no idea.

212
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.360
What about the airport?
It will be ...

213
00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:56.960
He'll be fine...
We'll leave it at that.

214
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.880
It's going to be okay.
It will be all right.

215
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.720
I trust Lüdtke Daltrup,
say politicians.

216
00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:05.800
What do you promise the people of Charlotten-
burgers and Wilmersdorfers?

217
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.320
Will they get
a freeway ring of their own,

218
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.840
a dome or
French fries barrier for all?

219
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.040
Do you live in Charlottenburg? - Nope.

220
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.960
Not yet, when I'm 65,
I'll move to Savignyplatz.

221
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.600
Is beautiful there.

222
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.840
When the one-bedroom apartment
costs 9000 euros. - That's it.

223
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.960
Do you live there?
You have to live there, don't you? - Yes.

224
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.360
Or can you ...
I live there.

225
00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.520
The miller
is Tempelhofer, isn't he?

226
00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:34.560
Yes. He could have run for
could have run for office in Tempelhof.

227
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.200
But there's Kevin Kühnert.

228
00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.520
Then he said: Well,
Kevin Kühnert is too strong for me,

229
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.120
I prefer to go
to the Charlottenburgers.

230
00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.680
They don't hear and see
no longer really.

231
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.040
Invite him and ask him.
Mr. Müller? - Yes.

232
00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.040
Not interested.
Not him or not you?

233
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.280
Nah, not me.
Ho-ho. - Nope.

234
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.600
This is cardigan miller
- does not interest me

235
00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:00.600
They are not given a chance to win against the mayor.
no chance of winning against the mayor.

236
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.280
Do you have a plan B? - Nope.

237
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:05.400
Then you'll go to the Greens?
Nah, never!

238
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.600
Nope? Nah! I am
so far away from the Greens.

239
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.960
You're with the SPD, and the SPD is
an absolute downward spiral.

240
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.200
I want to help
to get back up again.

241
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.440
After almost 20 years you would
I'm sure you'd like to join the Greens.

242
00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.680
That works better.
Never ever, never.

243
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.920
There's the better party.
Nah, honest.

244
00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.440
But that would make you
untrustworthy.

245
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.080
Can you imagine
Party Hopping,

246
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:28.920
sometimes with the Greens, sometimes ...

247
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.240
I wouldn't give a shit about unbelievable.
* thud *

248
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.320
Sorry, the mic...
What did you do? - Nah...

249
00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.560
Did you break something?
You have to pay for that.

250
00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.920
But the Greens are out of the question for me
out of the question for me. - Why?

251
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.320
That is already patronage politics.

252
00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:48.120
Social Democracy
at least has the claim,

253
00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:50.000
to speak for more people.

254
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.440
I am a refugee child.

255
00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:56.160
We have lived forever on Hartz IV,
social welfare.

256
00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:00.280
The fact that I am State Secretary also has
also to do with the policies of the SPD.

257
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.320
She made sure
that we are not left behind.

258
00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:06.840
That is why I am convinced
the SPD is the right party.

259
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.560
I know we are
totally unattractive right now.

260
00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:11.960
I was just about to...
Why the SPD?

261
00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.680
We have behind me camera 4.
... yes, full.

262
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.480
What?
Why SPD?

263
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.000
Because it is the party,
that ensures...

264
00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:21.680
Look in there? - Yes.

265
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.680
Shall I put crosses there for you.

266
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.360
Yes, I think ...

267
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.080
Here like this,
speak on the bottle.

268
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:34.240
So, why the SPD?

269
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.600
Because the SPD makes sure
that this country stays together.

270
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:42.280
Because the SPD makes sure,
that if you have no money ...

271
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.880
It's like a button with you guys, wa,
when you say why...

272
00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.720
I can do it even in my sleep.
... Chocolate ice cream with banana crumble.

273
00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.360
Then you talk ...
Yes, but with conviction.

274
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:54.040
Yes? Uh-huh.

275
00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.080
Really, with conviction.
Now comes the dachshund look to it.

276
00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.520
Do you have another rose with you?
Nope.

277
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:03.160
Do you have any promotional material with you?
Nope.

278
00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:06.400
I saw with Raed Saleh,
that it did not work.

279
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.520
How is he? There was
something going on after the broadcast.

280
00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.840
No one at the
no one at the SPD spoke to him anymore.

281
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.280
Not true, I spoke with him.
It was in the Morgenpost.

282
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.680
Really, yes? Morgenpost ...
Fuck it.

283
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.440
The SPD has been in power in Berlin
in power since 1989,

284
00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.040
since 2001 it has provided
the mayor.

285
00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.240
It also reacts for a long time in the federal government.

286
00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:28.880
The party is currently
in the state and federal governments at only 15%.

287
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.920
Why do voters
no longer want the SPD?

288
00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.960
Because people don't know
what we stand for.

289
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:39.280
Because people don't believe us.
Because people always just ...

290
00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:42.120
They have such
a preconceived opinion.

291
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.240
You'll know when ... - Who?

292
00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.560
A lot of people out there.

293
00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.640
They no longer understand
what the SPD stands for.

294
00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.760
What I mean is that we ...

295
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.280
Honestly, I believe
that Germany

296
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.960
would be so much worse off
without the SPD.

297
00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.880
Minimum wage, all of this,
Improvement of living conditions.

298
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:04.520
But the problem is,
that people don't see that.

299
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.240
People no longer know
what we stand for.

300
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:08.920
Have you got it? - Hm.

301
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.160
They say education is
key to a successful life

302
00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.800
and to the ascent. - Yes.

303
00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.800
Perhaps the misery of the
of the SPD is due to the issue of education.

304
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:20.040
Every 4th school in Berlin
is a "hot spot school".

305
00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.960
12% of kids leave
leave school without a diploma.

306
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.960
Schools are named instead of
after German celebrities,

307
00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.640
named after suburbs of Aleppo.
Why? - There is something to it.

308
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.560
Now you come,
now it's your turn.

309
00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.400
What do they change about it?

310
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.320
I am mentoring
in quite a few school projects.

311
00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.960
For example, there are ...

312
00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.640
I am of the opinion, there,
where parents can not deliver,

313
00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.280
the school must deliver.

314
00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.360
Where the school does not deliver,
the state must deliver.

315
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.320
There are many organizations
and initiatives,

316
00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:54.480
who help, for example, kids,
who have difficulties.

317
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.520
They take them by the hand and
enable them to climb the ladder.

318
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.640
In the Education Monitor, Berlin is

319
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.720
among all federal states
traditionally last.

320
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.760
This year, after all, in 13th place.

321
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:07.400
Now the price question:

322
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:10.760
Since when has the SPD
the senator for education in Berlin?

323
00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:12.680
* Gambling melody *

324
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.400
I don't know,
it was a long time ago.

325
00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.160
I don't know.

326
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.120
Many years and we should have
done better, I know.

327
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.120
* Gambling melody ends *

328
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.840
24 years. - Wow!

329
00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:32.200
That's an indictment, isn't it?
Is ... um, yes, is not good.

330
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.920
How many generations
ended up in construction,

331
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.720
because school sucked.

332
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:38.920
They were 12th out of 13 children

333
00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:42.360
a Palestinian refugee
refugee family.

334
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.600
They lived in a small apartment.

335
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.520
How is living together possible

336
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.400
with so many brothers and sisters
in a very small space?

337
00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:52.280
Was hard.

338
00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:54.880
Was that still Wedding
or Moabit? - Moabit.

339
00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:58.120
My parents later moved
first to the Märkisches Viertel,

340
00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.160
because they could no longer
could walk up the stairs.

341
00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:03.880
Yes, it was hard.
That was totally hard.

342
00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.360
We were fighting, fighting for space,
about every centimeter in the apartment.

343
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.840
Especially when I had to learn,
it was always a struggle,

344
00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.360
to find a quiet place.

345
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.720
I was a bit of a nerd.

346
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:19.120
It was not easy.

347
00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.280
As the 12th child
you are the runt of the litter.

348
00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:26.840
But hard time at home.

349
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000
They fled from Palestine
then to Lebanon.

350
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:31.680
Yes, my parents.

351
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.080
Then to Berlin?
Why Berlin?

352
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.640
My father had ...
they lived in the camp for 20 years.

353
00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.400
11 of my brothers and sisters
were born in the camp.

354
00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.640
How do you live in a camp for 20 years?
Refugee camp, yes.

355
00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.800
How cool is that?
Do not you go crazy?

356
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:50.440
Well, they had 11 children.
In the camp? - Yes.

357
00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.560
Oh, well, then ...
They have so the time ...

358
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:55.560
No, that's cynical now.

359
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.720
My father ...
But funny somehow also, right?

360
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.120
There knew two people,
how to kill time.

361
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.200
My father had
heard from friends, anyway,

362
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.880
in Berlin you can work
and there is a perspective.

363
00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.120
First he went to East Berlin, GDR,

364
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:14.880
and then across the border
Friedrichstraße to West Berlin.

365
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.840
He looked to get a foothold

366
00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:20.880
and then caught up
gradually caught up with the family.

367
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.120
I was then born here in '78.

368
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:26.320
But we were
only tolerated for so long, stateless.

369
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.760
My father was
deported three times and all that.

370
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.240
What is it like to be tolerated
and stateless? - Shit.

371
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.960
You are not allowed to travel.
You are not allowed to do anything.

372
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.640
What did you think,
if they deport us?

373
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.440
They deported my father.

374
00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.440
That was bad. You didn't know
whether we would ever get together again.

375
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:46.480
The time was already not good.

376
00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:50.000
But I am grateful to a father
that he came here,

377
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.200
otherwise I would not be here with you.

378
00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.600
That's where the ambition came from,
I want to get to the top?

379
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.680
From this came the ambition,

380
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:02.080
that not any politicians
should decide about my life.

381
00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.200
That is why the first row and the Bundestag.

382
00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.280
They wanted to have a career.

383
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:10.400
In the process you made
a far-reaching decision.

384
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.200
We are looking at a Maz.

385
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:15.800
There was already a time
where my parents,

386
00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.840
my mother would have liked to see
that I wear a headscarf.

387
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.600
2-3 years this was already
a debate at home.

388
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.640
I decided against it,
because I wanted to have a career.

389
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.720
Does this mean that those who do not wear a headscarf,
can make a career

390
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:34.360
and not the other way around?

391
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.320
I believe that it is
difficult in Germany.

392
00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.760
Today I wouldn't say that.

393
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:44.040
I don't think you can make a career
in Germany.

394
00:19:44.200 --> 00:19:46.560
I would not be
not Secretary of State,

395
00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:48.360
when I wear a headscarf.

396
00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:52.880
But I should also have said,
I don't want to wear a headscarf.

397
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.120
I dress the way I dress
dress because I feel like it

398
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:59.600
and because I
like to style my hair.

399
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.640
It's not just for the career,
but it's not mine.

400
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:07.040
But I support women
who do this voluntarily.

401
00:20:07.200 --> 00:20:11.080
Above all, I am committed to ensuring that they are not discriminated against,
that they are not discriminated against,

402
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.320
but that they get a job

403
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:17.000
and be judged as
as anyone else,

404
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.840
regardless of headscarf.

405
00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.320
I'm not up for it myself.

406
00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.000
It's not mine.

407
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.000
They arrived today
with 4 LKA officers.

408
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.040
Why?
Are they so unpopular, or?

409
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.520
I am not allowed to talk so much about
talk about the safety concept.

410
00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:38.360
Shouldn't I have said that?
Yes, only the how exactly ...

411
00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:42.600
Since the murder of
of Walter Lübcke actually protection,

412
00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:45.600
because I get quite
get a lot of death threats

413
00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.640
and once on the street
was attacked.

414
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.680
Then we realized
this is no longer a joke.

415
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.720
This is not only the mail,
that is written there,

416
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:58.720
but can become dangerous,
because I stand against the right,

417
00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:02.160
fight against racists
and always open my mouth.

418
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.080
There is a lot of garbage on the Internet about
you to read from the right corner.

419
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.560
Yes, really bad.
Do you read through everything? - Nah.

420
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:14.440
If I did that,
I would probably give up.

421
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:18.560
But I read 10% of that shit,
that's enough.

422
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.800
Do you have people
who read this for you

423
00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.640
and intervene,
when there are death threats?

424
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.000
Yeah, not Twitter and stuff,
you leave that running.

425
00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:29.840
But that which
comes by mail e.g. to the office,

426
00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.360
which is delinquent,
we file a criminal complaint.

427
00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:36.960
I'm reading this because
have to sign the criminal complaint.

428
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.560
That is enough for me
of hate and agitation.

429
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.480
A sexist statement has caused a
statement has caused a furor.

430
00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.600
This was in the right hand paper
"Tichy's Insight".

431
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.800
Editor Roland Tichy
thereupon gave

432
00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.920
his office as Chairman
of the Ludwig Erhard Foundation.

433
00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.600
Are you satisfied
that there were consequences?

434
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.680
Yes, I am glad
that he has now realized

435
00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.680
that he can't do everything.

436
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.600
But this is only a first step.

437
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.600
This shit,
Sorry, goes on.

438
00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:18.880
Every day I get
such sexist comments every day.

439
00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:22.120
Sexism is so common.

440
00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:24.160
People underestimate that.

441
00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:27.080
I think it's great
when you get compliments.

442
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.880
But sexism is a number more.

443
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:34.560
That's not the worst thing
I read, there were much worse.

444
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:38.880
Don't you even have the thought,
I'm throwing all this shit away.

445
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.120
Or do you think: Now more than ever?
Now more than ever.

446
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:48.280
Okay, Ms. Chebli, you want to
to run for the Bundestag.

447
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.680
Since I do not really know
on which political topics

448
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.800
you like stand, we make
a little game. - Okay.

449
00:22:54.960 --> 00:22:56.440
What now, Ms. Chebli?

450
00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.080
* Music *

451
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:03.280
Please only
answer with yes or no.

452
00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:06.760
I know this is hard for you,
but that's the game.

453
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.120
The SPD should
after the federal election

454
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.600
govern with the Left and the Greens,
not with the CDU again. - Yes.

455
00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:18.040
There should be compulsory vaccination
against Corona.

456
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:20.200
Yes.

457
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.920
After the poison attack on
Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny

458
00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.560
the German government must
stop the construction of Nord Stream 2.

459
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:30.720
Rather yes than no.
Only yes or no. - Yes.

460
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.600
For the admission of new asylum seekers
an annual cap.

461
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:38.240
No.

462
00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.320
Ban domestic flights?
No.

463
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.440
Tax high wealth.

464
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.080
Yes.

465
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:50.080
All citizens must
with statutory health insurers

466
00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.000
be insured.
No.

467
00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.640
Why not?

468
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.840
I am ...
Only answer yes or no.

469
00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:03.800
In Germany, there is to be an unconditional
unconditional basic income.

470
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.440
No.

471
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.440
Do you want to answer a question
not answer no or yes?

472
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:16.360
In the case of unconditional basic income
I would have said something else.

473
00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.240
I used to be an opponent
of the unconditional basic income,

474
00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:23.760
because I thought you couldn't
not be rewarded for it,

475
00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.880
that you lie lazily on the sofa.

476
00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.320
But a friend did
a study and found that

477
00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.800
that people with an
unconditional basic income,

478
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.600
- as a study,
1000 people have tested it -

479
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.120
the majority actually came
actually back to work.

480
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:42.880
They felt a sense of shame,
not to do anything

481
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.120
and get money for it.

482
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.440
Oh, unfortunately already end of the show,
I'm sorry. - No.

483
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.800
We are going out now. - What?
But we mustn't ...

484
00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.840
Can you stand up? - Yes.

485
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.240
When I count to three, you go
one step there and I go there.

486
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.680
Wait until I count
to count three: 1, 2, 3.

487
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:04.280
Now on and on like this.

488
00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:06.880
Because we do not ...
- is because of Corona.

489
00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:08.720
You need to open the door.

490
00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:11.200
Can I touch them?
Not with hands!

491
00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.640
Go there sometime.

492
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:20.520
Now open the door,
then please go around the outside.

493
00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.520
This is now serious
- Security measures.

494
00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.760
Don't we want to wear masks?
Nah, we're not allowed to.

495
00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.600
Because otherwise my mask will smear.

496
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.360
Go around that way.

497
00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:37.200
Now we are safe.

498
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.520
Do you still know Marcel Marceau?

499
00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.440
So, Ms. Chebli,
You want to run for office

500
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.280
for the district
Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf.

501
00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:50.520
You now have 10 seconds.

502
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:55.080
Are there any SPD members here
from Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf?

503
00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:57.840
Shit.
Yes, that what has been.

504
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.280
Chez Krömer, we say goodbye.

505
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:02.880
Ms. Chebli, thank you.
All the best.

506
00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.480
Good luck and blessings
on all their ways.

507
00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.640
All the best professionally as well.
Thank you.

508
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.280
Bye.

509
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.080
* Charles Aznavour:
"For me formidable" *

510
00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.000
Do you want me to go?

511
00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:27.480
We are still running.
You want me to say something else?

512
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.120
Shit, what?

513
00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.560
We are 11 minutes short,
say something.

514
00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:35.600
My God, I'm still allowed to say something.
About the SPD, about running for the Bundestag?

515
00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:39.440
Say something about the CDU, it's
otherwise boring, just one party.

516
00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.240
Nah, if anything, then to the SPD.

517
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:44.640
After all, there's no Social Democrat in it.
If it still runs ...

518
00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:48.520
Tell me, is there really no one
with the SPD? - That sucks.

519
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.160
The question is: Who is actually
the Kurt Krömer viewer?

520
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.880
What did you choose?

521
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.760
What do you choose?
Do we speak the same language?

522
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.840
What do you vote for?
I vote for the left.

523
00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.520
What? - Where?

524
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.200
Who?

525
00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.400
Oh you!
I can't hear anything through the window.

526
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.960
What do you vote for?
The left. - You see.

527
00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.200
How much ... and green?

528
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.720
What?
Does anyone vote at all?

529
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.160
In other words, no one wanted to
out as a social democrat, or what?

530
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.960
Is there one that has a high school diploma?

531
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.720
Say ...

532
00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.520
Was one 10 years in school,
no matter how that ended.

533
00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.200
What'n that?

534
00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:34.160
Well, Ms. Chebli, that's ...

535
00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.560
* exhales noisily *
... a jackpot.

536
00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.280
Hm.
Yes, I know.

537
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.920
* (clears throat)

538
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:45.840
Are you real people
or are you running on battery?

539
00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.200
You don't know,
because of Corona, you know?

540
00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:50.280
Are you paid?

541
00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:54.120
Good, um, then thank you,
Ms. Chebli.

542
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:57.000
Do you want to go ahead? - Mh.
Then you are safe.

543
00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:58.960
Bye.

544
00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.000
Nobody voted, or what?
Don't you vote?

545
00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.800
Yes, but not that.

546
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:17.240
Are you so Reichsbürger, or what?
Aluhut-wearers, or what?

547
00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:20.200
Are you stupid?
Doesn't anyone have a high school diploma?

548
00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:23.600
Are you all stupid?

549
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.560
Ouch. - There will be repercussions.
Did you run into something?

550
00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.320
Do we have that with the camera,

551
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.720
Ms. Chebli ran
just against the wall.

552
00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.120
Do you know how you
now get up and walk ...?

553
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.640
That you now so,
the way you came in

554
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.040
also goes out again?
Do you know that?

555
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.480
He gets it.

556
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.200
My guess is
an extended secondary school leaving certificate.

557
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.680
Okay, think about this.

558
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:55.720
