00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.280
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:11.640
The deceased belonged to

4
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.000
to a Russian
resistance organization.

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.120
The 15 bodies
were all members.

6
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.560
The organization is involved in
involved in an explosive smuggling operation.

7
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.960
How did you know
about the station?

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.880
I have been trying for years,

9
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:31.800
the treasure of my family
from the clutches of Stalin.

10
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.640
Have you seen the freight?
- Yes, I have.

11
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.720
Call the Charité,
They take them as a gift.

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.000
I don't want that.
Well, then take care of it.

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.520
*shot*

14
00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.520
Sorry, Major General.
Couldn't resist.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.960
Your brother has been officially
declared dead.

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.160
He is now considered "fallen".

17
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.240
And now?
We're here, if that's what you want.

18
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.600
*lively music*

19
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.440
# I feel like you.

20
00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.400
# I already felt like
like you yesterday.

21
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.200
# And I'll always feel like you.

22
00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.720
# Preferably
I'd like to be alone with you.

23
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.360
# And if you laugh about it
and what you do about it.

24
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.800
Hh!

25
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.560
Uh!

26
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.400
# I feel so much inside here today
for you.

27
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.800
(She joins in) "I don't know,
what's wrong with me."

28
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.800
"What's wrong with me,
is wrong with me."

29
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.640
"I don't know,
what's wrong with me."

30
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.440
"And how are you?"

31
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560
"Me, me, me."

32
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.400
"I feel like you so much,
I already felt like you yesterday."

33
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.320
Ah!
*She blows.

34
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.320
# And I'll always feel like you
for you!

35
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.840
Moritz!

36
00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.560
Moritz ...
- I know all about it.

37
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.880
About what?

38
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.680
About both of you.

39
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.440
I know you're pretending,
as if nothing is wrong with you.

40
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.840
You must
from Grandpa Engelbert,

41
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.160
because otherwise he will beat you to death.

42
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400
You always sneak
into bed with mom,

43
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.440
when you think I'm asleep.

44
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.200
You are afraid and lying.

45
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.480
Moritz!

46
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.200
It's not about that, Moritz.

47
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.800
We actually wanted
to tell you something,

48
00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.360
that we have long
have secretly known for a long time.

49
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.960
Your father
is no longer missing.

50
00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.960
He won't be coming back,
Moritz.

51
00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.560
It will come at some point.
- No.

52
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.800
Yes, it is!

53
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.480
Watch out!

54
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.600
He is dead.

55
00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.760
You are lying.

56
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:57.440
You're both lying.
I know he'll come back.

57
00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.560
I know that he is alive.

58
00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.720
And you?

59
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.960
You don't want us
don't want us here.

60
00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.720
*uncanny music

61
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.160
*rhythmic music

62
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.880
Ah.

63
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.640
Is that all?

64
00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.280
Just one side?

65
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.680
Yes.

66
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.760
And the entry from the other day,
where I went to the apartment?

67
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.560
There never was.

68
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.160
Thank you.

69
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.440
(Lotte?

70
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:42.400
Here.

71
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.880
Your type is required.

72
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.960
Yes, ick ...

73
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.440
I'll be right there.

74
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.680
You're going ahead anyway?

75
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:03.920
I need money.

76
00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.200
*quiet music

77
00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.160
"Well this is such a sad affair."

78
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.400
"I've opened up my heart

79
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.280
oh so many times."

80
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.640
"But now it's closed."

81
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.760
"Oh my dear ..."

82
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:40.440
"Every salted tear

83
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:46.920
it wrings bitter-sweet applause."

84
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.880
"But when the show's in full swing

85
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.880
every once in a while

86
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:07.760
high stepping chorus lines
mean I'm forgetting

87
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:12.720
my lullaby, darling."

88
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:26.280
I'm glad you could make it
Mr. Police Commissioner.

89
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.440
When the personal advisor
of the President of the Reich

90
00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:34.200
takes the time,
the matter must be important.

91
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.480
Believe me,
I wouldn't have bothered you,

92
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.720
were it not for the great urgency
would be required.

93
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.480
"Sometimes I'm quite amused

94
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.800
to see it twist and turn
to taste both sweet and dry."

95
00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.760
"These vintage years."

96
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.440
"Lovers you consume, my friend,
as others their wine."

97
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.800
Gerti!

98
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.000
Gerti, you have to help me.

99
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.800
What's going on?
I have customers.

100
00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.200
You MUST help me.

101
00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.920
"No, this is not
the end of the world."

102
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:26.440
"Stranded by life and art."

103
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.120
The President of the Reich
appreciates very much,

104
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:35.000
how you dealt with the demonstrators
on May 1.

105
00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.640
The matter
is not over yet.

106
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:40.200
My department
could be helpful.

107
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.920
We will see.

108
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.840
Sir, a drink request?
Thank you, not at the moment.

109
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.480
I'll do it ...

110
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.120
This is my table.

111
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.280
Why don't you go for a smoke?

112
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.600
Why is that?
Just like that.

113
00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.840
Ts ...

114
00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.200
(Trochin) ... made contact with
the President of the Reich.

115
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.280
(Wendt) Their seizure
of the train creates tension

116
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.800
between the Soviet Union
and the German Reich.

117
00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.240
The President of the Reich
does not want any tension.

118
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.520
I am happy to help.

119
00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.560
Then release the train.

120
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.960
And what happens to the freight?

121
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.240
It's going back to where it came from,
where it came from.

122
00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:32.000
(Zörgiebel) That you Soviets
cheerfully help with this,

123
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.840
the Reichswehr
illegally,

124
00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:36.640
is a thing in itself.

125
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.480
But that even
our head of state

126
00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:41.640
does not shy away from it,

127
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.480
the Versailles Treaties
to ignore them,

128
00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.800
is ... amazing.

129
00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.320
(Wendt) A misdirected delivery
Pesticides must be returned.

130
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.520
Don't make it more complicated
than it is.

131
00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.920
Why should such a relevant
evidence leave our country?

132
00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.680
Mr. Zörgiebel ...

133
00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:08.400
It is up to you,
whether the abrupt end of your career

134
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.440
with the deaths of many demonstrators
will be associated with the deaths of many demonstrators

135
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:23.360
or not.

136
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:38.720
(Trochin) Tell me, miss?

137
00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:41.960
Do we know each other?

138
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.880
Sorry?

139
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.520
We've met before.

140
00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:49.400
Yes, probably here.
No.

141
00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:51.320
Well, then you've got me confused.

142
00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.600
I have
a photographic memory.

143
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.960
Perhaps you have
seen a photo with me?

144
00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:01.720
No?

145
00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:22.800
*cheers*

146
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.160
Tomorrow.

147
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.600
Tomorrow.

148
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:56.720
Charlotte? Good morning.

149
00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.720
Oh, sorry.

150
00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.600
I must ... I urgently need
talk to you.

151
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:09.400
I think you need
a coffee first.

152
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.800
Come in.
Yes.

153
00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:25.600
Why can these people
put Zörgiebel under so much pressure?

154
00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.800
This is the Chief of Police.

155
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.400
It must have been
the Russian from the station?

156
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.960
For sure.

157
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:40.880
Have you slept at all?
You look a bit tired.

158
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.680
Half as wild.

159
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.360
All right, let's go then.
Let's get back to work.

160
00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.120
*sizzle

161
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.320
*deep breath*

162
00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:59.400
(muffled) Are you coming?

163
00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.200
*deep exhale

164
00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.400
*She sighs.

165
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:17.560
*Rumbles, clanks*

166
00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.440
Phew.

167
00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.200
You should get some rest.
Yes.

168
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:24.600
At home.

169
00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.160
I'm fine.

170
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:30.120
I was just a little bit
a little flowery.

171
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.680
So, what should I do?

172
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.560
Lie in bed at home.
- But why can I ...?

173
00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:38.400
Enough now!

174
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.360
*She groans.

175
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.640
Mr. Wendt!

176
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:15.600
Colonel!

177
00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.160
What do you want from me?

178
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.440
I have experienced almost all of your successes
personally.

179
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.400
You are a hero to me.

180
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.440
Get to the point.
- A German hero.

181
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.440
You and I are striving
for the same goal:

182
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.400
We both want
that men like you have a place

183
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.520
in the leadership of a strong,
proud Germany.

184
00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:42.600
Your irresponsible actions
has damaged our cause.

185
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.200
I have been deceived myself.

186
00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.320
I will not give you
your reputation back.

187
00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.680
I will make sure
that this unfortunate move

188
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.560
to Russia as soon as possible
as soon as possible.

189
00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.880
Now excuse me.
- But then all would be lost.

190
00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:02.840
Perhaps you will make an effort
for once

191
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.760
for a little clarity,
Mr. Nyssen.

192
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.200
I know the real reason,

193
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.240
why the Soviets want the train
want the train back so badly.

194
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.800
There is gold in the train.

195
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.320
Random samples were taken,
there was phosgene everywhere ...

196
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.000
Only one of the wagons
carries the load

197
00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.240
and I know the number
of this wagon.

198
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.640
I will not provoke a diplomatic
scandal because of her.

199
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:43.320
You don't have to.

200
00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.920
The value of the treasure

201
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.280
amounts to at least
one billion Reichsmark.

202
00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.640
Half of it
would be for you and the movement.

203
00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:55.360
And what should they
do in your opinion?

204
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:57.960
Intercept the train
intercept on the open track

205
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.280
and secure the wagon.

206
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.320
We must not leave the treasure
to the Bolsheviks.

207
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:05.960
You will hear from me.

208
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:16.600
*serious music

209
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:23.520
Take a look here.

210
00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:25.520
Dit Aas.

211
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.680
I asked her at our
wedding if she had a dress.

212
00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:33.560
"Nah, mine's been with the
with the Jew."

213
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.520
(quietly) Well, you?
*He whimpers.

214
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.800
What is it?

215
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.520
(Ilse) What about this?
- (Erich) Throw it away.

216
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.000
(Ilse) I don't believe it,
what she picked up.

217
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.680
(Erich) What she had.
- Dit noch und dit noch.

218
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.360
An embroidered handkerchief.
- Throw it in the corner.

219
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.120
What are you doing here?

220
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.960
The good ones in the pot,
the bad ones in the pot.

221
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.800
You shred mother's things?
Not me.

222
00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.840
Should I let their treasures
let them rot?

223
00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.920
I have mouths to feed.
Do you?

224
00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.640
And what kind of jewels
do you mean?

225
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.640
Well, this dress here.
One-a pre-war item.

226
00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.560
The Jew gives me
two Heiermänner for.

227
00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:20.160
We're still here too.

228
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.400
She didn't want to give it to you

229
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.800
for your liaison
with the good-for-nothing.

230
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.320
I'm the oldest,
that's my compulsory part!

231
00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.720
So, Father, up with the bones!

232
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.920
Let it go!
- Stop it please!

233
00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.160
You should let it go!
Ilse!

234
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.920
*Ilse and Lotte shout at each other.

235
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.960
What are you doing there?

236
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.880
I want to know
what's under the pillow.

237
00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:46.440
Give me a hand!
- Leave grandpa alone!

238
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.120
Stop it!

239
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120
Grandpa!

240
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.280
Are you crazy?! Do you still have them
still got them all together, you dog?

241
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:10.800
Grandpa! Grandpa? Toni, come and help.
Come up, Grandpa.

242
00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:11.640
*Grandpa groans.

243
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.760
Nobody touches the grandpa!

244
00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.000
Not you and not you either.

245
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.760
(Good afternoon.
Two blood sausages, please.

246
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.640
Here you go.
One small and one large.

247
00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.000
Thank you.
- 5.30 marks.

248
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.840
Fritz!
- Greetings, doll.

249
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.120
What are you doing here?
Did you know any of them?

250
00:19:21.360 --> 00:19:23.400
That's not the point. Come along.

251
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.840
I can't,
I have to work.

252
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.760
But then also tell
at home with the murderers,

253
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.320
what you have seen.

254
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:34.120
The murderers? What do you mean?

255
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:37.840
Who do you think killed the comrades
on their conscience?

256
00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.960
The massacre on May 1.

257
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.000
Mr. Benda?
- Who else?

258
00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.400
Get in line.

259
00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.840
*dark music*

260
00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.400
Fritz!

261
00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.840
Mr. Commissioner?

262
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:11.000
The detection service
has confirmed the caliber.

263
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.520
Of the dead from the pine forest.

264
00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.640
It is the Russian model:
7.62 Tokarev.

265
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:19.720
Fired
from two different weapons,

266
00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.240
but both with the same caliber.

267
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.320
In Berlin there are exactly
two registrations of this weapon.

268
00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.200
And they are also
from last week.

269
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:31.400
Selenskij, Pjotr.

270
00:20:32.120 --> 00:20:33.240
Fallin, Michail.

271
00:20:33.480 --> 00:20:36.640
Both members
of the Soviet embassy.

272
00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.240
Both of them had their weapons
on our train.

273
00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480
On the throttle cable?

274
00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.920
Then we arrest them.
It's been tried several times.

275
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.280
The investigations
were closed each time.

276
00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:50.760
They have diplomatic status.

277
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.760
Why did they want to arrest her?
Illegal gambling.

278
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.360
It's about illegal dog betting.

279
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:20.920
*shouts, barks*

280
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.840
*Voices and barking get louder.

281
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.760
*Men shout in confusion.

282
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:54.200
The brown one brings it! Two marchers!

283
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.000
Go, go, Bruto, grab it!

284
00:21:58.760 --> 00:22:00.640
Come on!
- Ten marks!

285
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
*cheers*

286
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.400
*They shout in confusion.

287
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.880
Come on, come on!
- Grab him!

288
00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:21.920
*You speak Russian.

289
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.840
*loud whistle*

290
00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.560
So, ladies and gentlemen, time to call it a day!

291
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.800
*He speaks Russian.

292
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.920
(What do you want?

293
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.800
Anyone who participates in illegal gambling
and betting,

294
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.400
is liable to prosecution.

295
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.400
I'm sorry, Commissioner.

296
00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:48.800
I am a member of the consulate
of Soviet Russia.

297
00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:52.520
You have been arrested
for illegal possession of firearms

298
00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:54.320
and 15 counts of murder.

299
00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:57.280
*He shouts something in Russian.

300
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.920
*quiet music

301
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.600
*She rings.

302
00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.360
Charlotte.

303
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:44.720
Hello.

304
00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.640
What's going on?
I didn't want to disturb you.

305
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.400
You're not interrupting anything. Come in.

306
00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:54.200
Good evening.

307
00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:57.280
I'm a work colleague
of your son.

308
00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.000
My parents
can't hear you.

309
00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.240
Please.

310
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:05.960
Good evening, Mr. Jänicke.

311
00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:17.360
Would you like something to eat?
M-m.

312
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:19.600
(Mrs. Jänicke) Soup.

313
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800
We have them.

314
00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:28.640
Who?

315
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:32.440
The murderers from the print shop.
From the "Red Fortress".

316
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.120
Ah. Well, that's good.

317
00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:40.960
Did something happen?

318
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.400
What does he say?
Nothing.

319
00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.800
He asks if you need a bed,
for the night.

320
00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:08.120
Well, if I could ...
It's only for a few hours.

321
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.760
I am actually
immediately ...

322
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.240
No question about it.
I'll give you my bed.

323
00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.600
I'll take the sofa.
I have to get up early tomorrow anyway.

324
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.520
(quietly) It's very tasty.

325
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.160
*quiet music

326
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.800
*She sobs quietly.

327
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.640
(crying) I'm fine. Thank you.

328
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.560
*quiet music

329
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.400
*Alarm clock rings.

330
00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.880
Get a radio by tomorrow
a radio by tomorrow.

331
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.800
*exciting music*

332
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.400
*exciting music*

333
00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:32.800
(Jänicke)
"The number of this wagon ..."

334
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.360
"... strategic point
outside the city,

335
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.800
about 50 kilometers ..."

336
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.800
"The route
leads south out of the city."

337
00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:07.360
"If we succeed,
the train at kilometer 127 ..."

338
00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:10.720
"Direction Wünsdorf ..."

339
00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.600
Hey, did you steal that?

340
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.960
What? You must be crazy.
That's mine.

341
00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.880
Theft!
The man stole a panorama!

342
00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:37.840
Take your hands off!

343
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.200
The man stole a panorama!
Theft!

344
00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.480
He stole a panorama!
Theft!

345
00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.120
(Benda?
- I need to speak to your husband.

346
00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.200
At this time of day
my husband is rarely at home.

347
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:55.720
It is very important.

348
00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:58.480
In the castle
I didn't reach anyone.

349
00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:01.480
Please tell me
where I can find him.

350
00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:05.360
He did not inform me of the location
of his appointment.

351
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.720
Goodbye again.
- Goodbye.

352
00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:29.560
What is that?

353
00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:31.920
These are the pictures of 15 dead people,

354
00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:34.840
that we found a few days ago
found a few days ago.

355
00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.920
Removed from the city
and buried deep.

356
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.120
But not deep enough.

357
00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:42.360
What do you want from me?

358
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.560
I want to cause you trouble.

359
00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.480
And so much trouble,
as 15 murdered activists

360
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:52.760
and two confessed agents
of your diplomatic representation

361
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.400
can only do.

362
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:58.320
(Benda) 15 executed
revolutionaries of the "Red Fortress".

363
00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:01.960
Plus the railroad man,
who brought the train here.

364
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.400
I don't know,
why you're stealing my time here.

365
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.920
We have confiscated the weapons of these gentlemen
confiscated.

366
00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:10.720
In almost every one of the bodies

367
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.520
bullets
from their pistols.

368
00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:16.200
Tokarev, 7.62.
Russian replica.

369
00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:19.840
Exclusively for the members
of your secret service.

370
00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:21.800
What do you want?

371
00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:26.560
Propose a business to you.
- Why should I take part?

372
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.640
Because otherwise your head office
to Moscow

373
00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.720
and with
your careless employees

374
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.680
be placed against the wall.

375
00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.960
If the massacre
becomes public,

376
00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.760
that would certainly mean your death sentence
would certainly be your death sentence.

377
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.440
You know that.
- What is your offer?

378
00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.800
I want those responsible
of the Reichswehr,

379
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.000
who organize the transport of the toxic gas
organize

380
00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.160
and for years
the secret reconstruction

381
00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.800
of the German military.

382
00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:01.680
You want me to
your own countrymen?

383
00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:04.640
Yes.
The top 15 ranks are enough.

384
00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.440
In return, these 15
patriots who died in exile

385
00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.600
home to Mother Russia.

386
00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.640
Hand washed by hand.

387
00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.680
You have nothing more to fear from us in this
nothing more to fear from us,

388
00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:21.600
No investigation
of the circumstances of death.

389
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.600
*dark music*

390
00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.880
*dark music*

391
00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.720
The rest is for you.

392
00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:18.400
I expect good work.
 Yes.

393
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.600
Goodbye.

394
00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.960
Thank you.

395
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.920
Do you want to go up to your people?

396
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.920
Shall I take you with me
to the castle?

397
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:00.000
*quiet, sad music

398
00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.000
Oh, Wolter!
You're exactly who I was looking for.

399
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.800
Ah, Böhm! Everything healthy?

400
00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:35.320
Simple question: What did you
and your friend from Cologne

401
00:33:35.560 --> 00:33:38.320
on Thursday
in the "Pepita Bar"?

402
00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.680
Yodeling. With all the trimmings.

403
00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:44.480
Don't grin so stupidly, man!
Answer the question!

404
00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:48.800
We bit one off.
With St. Joseph?

405
00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.160
St. Joseph?
In the "Pepita"? Nope!

406
00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:04.200
Mr. Jänicke, I have
decrypted the telegram.

407
00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.480
You? Alone?

408
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.520
After all, he was born
Russian by birth.

409
00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.840
(with accent)
If I am Balte, I am powerful.

410
00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:15.720
"Uncle has crossed the border,
Gift on the way to Berlin."

411
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.560
That should still be
to Commissioner Rath.

412
00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:22.640
Detective Assistant Jänicke!
Your superior, where is he?

413
00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.280
Please?
- Where is your supervisor?

414
00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:28.480
On the road.
- What comes to his mind,

415
00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:31.400
to interfere
to interfere in my case?

416
00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:35.480
Tell him that tomorrow morning
he's in for a treat.

417
00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:37.000
Nine o'clock at Gennat!

418
00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:39.960
Always refreshing,
Mr. Böhm.

419
00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:48.200
I think I'd better let the commissioner
the commissioner.

420
00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:51.120
Take it to him
home tonight.

421
00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:53.600
To Wolter?
- Mhm. Police estate.

422
00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:55.840
Opposite the old Luxwerke.

423
00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:00.800
*Music, babble of voices

424
00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.480
*lively music*

425
00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:45.200
*Typewriter clatters.

426
00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.680
Excuse me?

427
00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:50.160
Can I borrow your radio?
Absolutely.

428
00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.200
Our esteemed landlady
is almost unbearable,

429
00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.240
since she knows you're moving out.
Oh yeah?

430
00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:00.280
I wonder if that
with the sudden appearance

431
00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.240
has to do with your G'spusi?

432
00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:04.800
Are you making progress?
Yes.

433
00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:08.200
This will be my very personal ode
to our esteemed

434
00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.600
Chief of Police
Karl Friedrich Zörgiebel,

435
00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.640
Your new employer.

436
00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:16.400
He didn't like it,
Your article.

437
00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:18.640
That's what they say in the castle.

438
00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:27.240
For days now we have been bombarded by
from the right-wing camp

439
00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.640
with this smackdown:
"The Shot Police Master

440
00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.400
returns home at last
to wife and child."

441
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.240
It suits you too.

442
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.920
Did you find the security guard?
Yes.

443
00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:42.160
And the wife, the near-widow.
And the child.

444
00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.120
And I was also in hospital.

445
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.960
Have the honor, Mrs. Dörr.

446
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.520
Katelbach, I am an acquaintance
of your husband.

447
00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.840
And the evil communist,
who is said to have shot at him,

448
00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.720
has just turned
three years old.

449
00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.640
You can't be serious.

450
00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:02.800
It's all there.

451
00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.240
And tomorrow in the "Weltbühne".

452
00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.840
Good luck and see you soon.

453
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:12.120
How soon?

454
00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.520
Still uncertain.
It's worse than you think.

455
00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:19.360
They have only just begun to
become bearable.

456
00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.680
I'll be in touch.

457
00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:24.240
You will have the device
back in one week at the latest.

458
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.520
Absolutely.

459
00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.360
Elisabeth?

460
00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.440
*knock*

461
00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.800
Elisabeth?

462
00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:56.560
Just a moment, Commissioner.

463
00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.800
Where did you get my address?

464
00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.600
The investigations against Zörgiebel
were discontinued.

465
00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.520
The relatives of the dead

466
00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.320
want a civil suit
against the arbitrariness of the police.

467
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.600
You can't just
You can't just mug me here.

468
00:38:11.840 --> 00:38:14.160
They saw the women die.

469
00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.600
You have seen
who fired the shots.

470
00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.720
I didn't see anything.

471
00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:21.880
The widower told me,

472
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.960
that you have been
in the apartment again.

473
00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:26.840
On the balcony. Why?

474
00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.400
All you have to do is testify,

475
00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.160
that the women
were not armed.

476
00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:37.600
That there were no fighters
or weapons were hidden in her apartment.

477
00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.440
That's enough.
That would help a lot.

478
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.200
I do not deliver colleagues
to the knife.

479
00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:49.280
We communists are systematically
labeled as perpetrators or murderers.

480
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:52.320
Whether this is true or not
or not,

481
00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:55.400
nobody seems to be interested.

482
00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:59.560
In the case of the two women, it is
untrue - you and I know that.

483
00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:01.520
Good evening, Mr. Rath.

484
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.760
*floating dance music

485
00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.720
Excuse me, please,
I've been held up.

486
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.200
You look adorable.

487
00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:11.200
Willy, Bruno speaking.

488
00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.320
You can take the delivery
to my cellar.

489
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.880
Yes, that's good.

490
00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.200
You know where the key is.

491
00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.440
*Rattling of the streetcar

492
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600
*whistle*

493
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.320
Excuse me?

494
00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:13.120
There's supposed to be a shortcut here
to the police settlement.

495
00:41:13.360 --> 00:41:16.880
Through there, then keep left
and across the terrain.

496
00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:19.640
On the other side of the factory.
- Thank you.

497
00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:44.640
Great tip.

498
00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.800
*Clatter, quick steps,
silence*

499
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.400
Hello?

500
00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.680
Hello?

501
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.720
*Steps*

502
00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.800
*He unlocks the gun.

503
00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:28.560
*noises*

504
00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.560
*Steps*

505
00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:39.480
*He breathes frantically.

506
00:42:49.560 --> 00:42:51.160
*exciting music*

507
00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.000
Freeze! Police!

508
00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:24.440
Who are you?

509
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.800
What do you want?

510
00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.320
*driving music

511
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.120
*Steps move away.
