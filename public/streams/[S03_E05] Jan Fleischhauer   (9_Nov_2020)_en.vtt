00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.080
.

2
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.160
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.600
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:12.200
# You are my love
very, very, veritable

5
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.960
I'll leave this open, it's so tense.
(Bavarian) Good day, folks.

6
00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.200
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.680
* exhales noisily *

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.400
Jan Fleischhauer, 58,
Journalist, columnist and book author.

9
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.080
He worked for 30 years
for the Spiegel,

10
00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.800
he joined Focus in August 2019.

11
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.080
He says about himself that he became
a conservative by accident.

12
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.840
Mr. Fleischhauer? - Yes?

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.160
Uh, question first, did you
come today by mistake?

14
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.360
(laughing) Nah, by invitation.

15
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.120
They have accepted and
know roughly what to expect

16
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.040
and have full Bock on it?

17
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.160
Yes, we are doing
a reading together, I heard.

18
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.720
(softly)
Yes, you might think that.

19
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.200
So.

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.480
Uh.

21
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.440
I am very happy.

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.000
You know, just
the view on Check.

23
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.040
Also still completed.

24
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.880
Is this a crappy format here,
where doors are locked.

25
00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.520
* Door buzzer *

26
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.600
So.

27
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.280
Good evening, Mr. Fleischhauer.
Good evening.

28
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.080
Do you want a drink?

29
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.920
Yes, water. - Water.

30
00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.360
With or without? - Without.

31
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.480
Without water?

32
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.120
* laughs maliciously *

33
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.920
Can you open that up?

34
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.440
You know, carbonic acid
is a bit dangerous. - Here.

35
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.440
Thank you.
For them ...

36
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.600
... and for me.

37
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.280
So, Mr. Fleischhauer,
the Fleischhauer file, please.

38
00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.120
What is this, anyway?

39
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.640
This is taped off because of ...,
what does it say there anyway?

40
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.320
* Beep *
...source.

41
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.720
Why is it taped off?

42
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.680
That's an honorable brand, isn't it?

43
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.280
Do they name any other brands
or do we leave it like this?

44
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.000
Let's leave it that way.
I did not start with that.

45
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.760
I am not familiar with
Berlin water.

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.160
You are now, 2019,
You have now how long,

47
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.240
65 years working there
at the mirror? - 30.

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.560
30 years? - Yes, I was
at 25 by Rudolf Augstein

49
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.600
as a child soldier to the assault
of democracy.

50
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.560
Now you're at Focus.
Is that a step down?

51
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.080
I think it's a super company.
You have to say yes.

52
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.560
Super company and colleagues.
Shitty store you can not say.

53
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.600
V.a. a super publisher
- the last of its kind.

54
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.480
Just great people.
He is the last of his kind.

55
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.560
They only take people ...

56
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.960
Who is that? Burda?
Yes, Hubert Burda.

57
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.480
Great store, wonderful.
Wonderful - Focus.

58
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.760
See for yourself,
It's a complete waste of time.

59
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.520
Can't ask you
what you think about it.

60
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.760
You have to say it's good.

61
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.840
It makes sense to me that
their column "The Black Channel

62
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.240
was a trademark at Der Spiegel.

63
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.440
The lonely conservative
among leftists.

64
00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.240
It wasn't all left-wing, but yes.

65
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.560
Now you are quasi
conservative among conservatives.

66
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.360
Yes, although the readers
do not feel that way.

67
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.640
They turn on the TV,
watch the Tagesthemen commentaries

68
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.480
Tagesschau, rbb
and do not have the feeling,

69
00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.000
that this
is a conservative station.

70
00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.520
They are full on advertising.
Name more? * beep * Cola?

71
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.320
I smoke * beep * e.g.

72
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.280
* beep * still eaten earlier
- running.

73
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.080
Did you go to Focus for the money?

74
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.560
After all, money is not bad.

75
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.760
Well, sure.
You're not here for fun either.

76
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.000
I am not the Karl Marx
of the comedy scene, no.

77
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.520
But was there more coal
or was there less?

78
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.640
I had to sign a contract here
before I came here.

79
00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.840
I have never experienced that before.
There is such a secrecy...

80
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.040
Everything secret that we do here
is not made public.

81
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.000
19 pages and there I have ...

82
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.880
Look, where does it say that?

83
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.040
Somewhere here ...
Secrecy paragraph 4.

84
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.280
Did you know that the
must be signed?

85
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.440
Nah, I don't sign
nothing in principle.

86
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.760
Yes, read ahead.
... absolute silence ...

87
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.280
About what?
Everything we are talking about here.

88
00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.600
Now on the show,
or what? - Hm.

89
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.360
Isn't that for ass?

90
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.560
I think it's great,
because in the Instagram world,

91
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.240
where people take out cell phones all the time,
making such an old fashioned show:

92
00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.360
Best not to talk about it.
Yes, we don't want to talk about that.

93
00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.280
Now you're also with Servus TV?
Yes, exactly.

94
00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:17.640
Good. - Yeah.
It's going well, isn't it? - Working.

95
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.040
Do you already have
own jewelry collection at HS 44

96
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.240
or whatever it's called?
I'm working on that. - You are? - Sure.

97
00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.920
At Servus TV, what are you doing there?

98
00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:32.040
10 minutes every Monday evening
Reflections on Germany

99
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.280
and the situation in our country.
And conservative.

100
00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.520
As a man from the bottom
explain the term to me?

101
00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.240
What is conservative?

102
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.400
After all, I don't have a missionary work.

103
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.800
You won't find any
membership applications for anything.

104
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.680
For me, conservative
not being left-wing.

105
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.000
That's enough in my/
our world, the media culture world.

106
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.320
That is conservative? In principle
Being against the left is conservative?

107
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.600
I do not say,
that I am conservative? - Yes you are.

108
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.240
It was called "accidentally conservative."

109
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.120
I come from a good
social democratic family.

110
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:13.440
Rebel against their parents

111
00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.920
because they were with the SPD,
I think?

112
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.040
Is that the principle:
I will not what my age is,

113
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.040
that you are not with SPD
but CDU

114
00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080
or listen to German Schlager?

115
00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:31.280
Everything the old man didn't do?
I always dutifully voted for the Greens.

116
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.800
Nah, it was,
I think, such an unwillingness.

117
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.920
If everyone always agrees too much,
I get restless.

118
00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:42.640
Where I live, in the media world,
in the editorial conferences,

119
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.160
most people are in agreement
how things are to be seen.

120
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.200
That's where I get
such a spirit of contradiction comes out.

121
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.080
You say: "In the media world
I represent

122
00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.680
A minority position,
not on the street." - Hmm.

123
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.320
Are you
approached on the street?

124
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:02.120
People kneel down:
"I have seen the butcher,

125
00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.080
Can I touch you?"

126
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:07.680
You need television for that,
that only happens with Krömer.

127
00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.680
But which street do they mean?
Lindenstrasse, Weserstrasse?

128
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:14.640
I believe what I write,

129
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.840
can probably 50-60 %
of Germans can sign

130
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.360
and say, "Right is the man".
Have they all asked?

131
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.760
I'm probably the last mainstream
journalist sitting here. - What?

132
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.720
No! - Yes. - With me?

133
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.240
I have watched
watched the episodes.

134
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.080
What was the sharpest question
they asked Kevin Kühnert?

135
00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:39.120
How big is it?
I have something there, I have something there:

136
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.400
You'll have to ask the others.

137
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.360
Can't remember.
Ask the others.

138
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.200
Is that secrecy, too?
I do not know.

139
00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:53.600
Are you pissed
about the contract? - No, no.

140
00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.760
One must be careful with you.
I have brought something with me.

141
00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.760
You always cut everything out,
I heard.

142
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.000
Oh, so now you want to ... - Sure.
Yes, cut everything. - Right?

143
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.640
* (clears throat)

144
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.680
You're afraid that everything positive
will be cut only for me?

145
00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.600
Exactly, that's what I always say.

146
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.560
Go back, otherwise you'll only film
the corner. - It's already running.

147
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.560
Yes, that's right.
So, right, now we have it.

148
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.800
You don't have to turn the phone over,

149
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.680
there is a button at the bottom,
then it turns around like this.

150
00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.680
* beep * ...fon.

151
00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:31.840
* laughs maliciously *

152
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.400
Will that also be banned?
So, minority position.

153
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.080
Does the Focus have a reason for this? Why
to shell out money for minorities?

154
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.360
I just said,
the readers like it.

155
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:49.800
Do you sometimes watch Tagesschau,
Tagesthemen? - Yes, of course.

156
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.480
And the comments?

157
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:54.360
Focus not,
that confuses me.

158
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.960
Always red, green,
always the thumb on it.

159
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.440
There is always advertising
and there again ...

160
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.920
And hello folks: flip-flop time,
watch your feet and stuff.

161
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.040
Am I too old for. - Do you remember
Remember a sharp comment

162
00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:12.560
against Robert Habeck and Annalena
Baerbock, the Green Party chairmen?

163
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.760
Actually not.
From whom now?

164
00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:18.440
Public television,
where they work.

165
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:22.280
That someone made an ugly comment?
I do not remember.

166
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:23.960
Habeck is stupid.

167
00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.760
Who else?
Well, that will be cut out.

168
00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:31.040
You're really afraid of it, aren't you?

169
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.720
You have now come against it.
True.

170
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:38.240
I am no longer in the picture, could
we cut. -That's Mr. Krömer.

171
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.200
Look, there's a clock up there.
Turn around.

172
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.240
It is now at 9:42 minutes.

173
00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:48.160
If you manage to get out of here exactly
you're out of here in exactly 30 minutes,

174
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.120
we cannot cut anything.

175
00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.880
Is that how we want to do it? - Hm.

176
00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.800
Ingrid, can we turn the clock
to the other side?

177
00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.960
I am talking to God.

178
00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.000
All cool. - Okay,
You look up there now.

179
00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:11.040
We are exactly after 30 min. here
out, which would also please me,

180
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.360
because I'm also glad
when the shit is over.

181
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.720
They say:
I live from the people,

182
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.640
who wish me to hell

183
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.760
at least as much by those
who appreciate me.

184
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.480
A polarization story,
or what?

185
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:32.080
Many people say: We
definitely don't want to read anymore,

186
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:34.200
what the butcher writes.

187
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.160
I put on Twitter or Facebook
a little note,

188
00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.760
that I have written a column
I have written

189
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.280
and people
can not resist

190
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.840
and say:
What does the lunatic write now?

191
00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.600
I am a great beneficiary
of masochistic reading.

192
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:53.840
That people read something that they
actually no longer want to read.

193
00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.480
So people,
who like it and do not like it.

194
00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.680
What about me,
who doesn't care what you write?

195
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:02.160
They are lost
for me as a reader.

196
00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.560
There you have a list for you.

197
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.000
The main thing against.
Do you read? - Please?

198
00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.960
Do you read? - Your columns?
Nope, at all. Yeah, I don't.

199
00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:15.080
Ask the others,
I do not know if I ...

200
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:19.080
I read so many columns.
Books? - Books, too, yes.

201
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.920
What was the last book?
The last book was Patrick Süskind,

202
00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.240
"The Story of Mr. Summer.

203
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.880
120 pages, top.

204
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.720
What was that now?
Slapstick, or what?

205
00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.920
So, let's move on.
You need to look at the clock.

206
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.760
We are now
at 11 minutes and 41, 42 seconds.

207
00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.080
I stumbled
over a passage in your book.

208
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.760
"I belong to a generation
that knows nothing else

209
00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:51.720
than the dominance of the left."

210
00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.280
Were they born in the GDR?
Well, were they still leftists?

211
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.840
No, but do you
to a university today?

212
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:04.080
Normal editorial conferences,
Theater, I would say,

213
00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.600
when you have probably
95% of the people who work there,

214
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.760
shake awake at night and ask,

215
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:12.640
who the last
Green Party chairmen were,

216
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.040
they can pray back to 1970.

217
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.720
But in 50 out of 70 years
Germany will be governed by the CDU,

218
00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.160
nothing with leftists.
That's right.

219
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:26.000
There are no leftists in DAX companies.

220
00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.400
Springer, Burda, Focus, hello,
Bertelsmann belong

221
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:32.280
one of the largest media companies
Germany

222
00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.160
and are now not left.

223
00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.400
When did it start with you,
that you said,

224
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.800
that's too many leftists for me?

225
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.840
At the mirror.
What? - At the mirror.

226
00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.920
They are all left-wing? - Yep.
Maybe they were once, huh?

227
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.960
There was maybe
once a weekend or so.

228
00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:54.400
You come from a different
I think that's good.

229
00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:58.080
What world do I come from?
I grew up in Wedding.

230
00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.920
Yes, and born in Neukölln,
Working-class child.

231
00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.960
Comprehensive school after
dropped out after the 10th grade.

232
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.080
I'm a man of the streets.
Hardly exists anymore.

233
00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:10.280
I am the only
mainstream journalist left.

234
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.760
Go today
times to the university.

235
00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.400
University. - Yes, university.

236
00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:18.000
Go to the lecture hall
at the Humboldt University around the corner.

237
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.600
Okay.
People like you don't exist there anymore.

238
00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:24.480
This kind of educational promise
is no longer being kept.

239
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:27.800
There worry only
migrant gender aunts,

240
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.480
whether the gender star
has been set correctly.

241
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:34.440
But you have made up your mind
and wrote it down on the train,

242
00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.120
that you say these are
gender star aunts and all that.

243
00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:40.440
I do write every day. - Yes.

244
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.560
Yes, you have
but set now.

245
00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:46.520
Let's get your pants down,
Mr. Fleischhauer.

246
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.520
They set out to do things,
where they say, I had to give my ...

247
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.480
... live up to it,
this "I am against".

248
00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.000
13 minutes and 59 seconds.

249
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.400
Have they quit smoking?

250
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.000
No, I can't find
my cigarettes.

251
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.960
You have also
once decided on something.

252
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.560
You were in 2019 on the birthday
of the right populist

253
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.800
and ex-Spiegel journalist
Matthias Matussek. What was going on?

254
00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.960
Friend turns 65,
invites, you go.

255
00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.080
Did you take him aside and say
and said: Hey, Matze, what's going on?

256
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.760
Drifting a little to the right right now.
Mm-hm.

257
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:32.280
There was some excitement, because there were some
some right-wing figures were jumping around.

258
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:37.080
Mrs. Steinbach was there.
Yes, she was also on your show.

259
00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.280
Who is that in the middle,
an ex-mirror colleague?

260
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.800
That's also a Spiegel colleague.
Who else was there?

261
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.280
Dieter Stein
of Junge Freiheit.

262
00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.920
Where did he get
the sunglasses from?

263
00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:52.240
I see, Identitarian

264
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.520
- Mario.

265
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:56.840
As I said,
there was great excitement:

266
00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.360
Can you go to a birthday party
go to a birthday party?

267
00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:04.200
I do not let guest lists
shown to friends beforehand,

268
00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:07.600
before I go to a party.
Or how do you hold it?

269
00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:10.640
Well ... How long
have you been friends with him?

270
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.240
Married,
I was about to say.

271
00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.600
How long?
Since I was at the mirror.

272
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.400
30 years?
Almost 30 years.

273
00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.360
You don't ask a buddy like that:
What are you doing?

274
00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:24.040
That is another question.
That is a question of privacy.

275
00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:25.720
For him to walk away like that?

276
00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.440
Or you go to a party
and split that because?:

277
00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.680
We leave out the political
and are just friends?

278
00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:36.520
Nah, you don't want to be friends
with someone anymore,

279
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.720
if it drifts that far, sure.

280
00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.840
This question is none of the public's
nothing to do with you, only with yourself.

281
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.720
I don't want to live in a country
where people ask:

282
00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.280
Can you still be
be friends with him?

283
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.120
You would not answer
You would not answer me:

284
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.240
Are you still friends
with Matthias Matussek?

285
00:15:54.400 --> 00:15:57.760
I would answer over a beer,
- not in public.

286
00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:00.280
That is
of the public.

287
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:03.400
If you tell me
and we cut it out?

288
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.720
Yes, that would be good.
I have to stick to the contract.

289
00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:09.560
Let's do today
30 minutes and 30 seconds,

290
00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.160
You tell me,
we cut that out

291
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.640
and give you my word of honor,
would you answer?

292
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.880
That's ..
That's what annoys me.

293
00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:25.360
Then say whether you are
are still friends or not?

294
00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.000
That's silly.

295
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:31.320
This way of always looking to see if people are sitting
are sitting on the right podiums,

296
00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:34.440
who is sitting next to you ...
I think it's terrible.

297
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:40.600
You once said in an interview
I'm a fan of insult.

298
00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.120
What is
a successful insult for you?

299
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.160
An original insult.
Example?

300
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:52.400
Yes.
It has to be original, not flat.

301
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.520
You said original is good.
But not flat.

302
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.400
I didn't think they were bad.

303
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.000
Henryk Broder,
was also already with you,

304
00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.200
says about a television announcer
of the ZDF or cultural presenter,

305
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:07.720
she would lie when speaking
head slightly tilted to the side,

306
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:11.560
so that the thoughts
could collect on one page.

307
00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.880
The woman then challenged
challenged this before the regional court.

308
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.800
I thought it was a good insult,
succeeded.

309
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:22.800
That's what my parents used to say,
when I made like this.

310
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:26.040
"Is the head so heavy
that you have to support it?"

311
00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.880
But what you said
also goes a bit against women.

312
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.720
You like that, wa,
a little bit of a tease like that.

313
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.360
Would you say that
not to make jokes about women,

314
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:44.680
because they are the weaker sex
and can't take it?

315
00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.560
Of course, if you do not say,
Women are too stupid because ...,

316
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.920
you can make fun
make fun of everything with women.

317
00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.640
He did not say,
all women are stupid,

318
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.400
but about one,
that maybe...

319
00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:00.880
I can also pick out a woman
who I find stupid.

320
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.600
Erika Steinbach
I found strunzendoof.

321
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:07.400
Not from the intellect,
but simply a stupid person.

322
00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:10.080
Rarely stupid.

323
00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:15.640
That is then more of an opinion,
you can have.

324
00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.960
But I wouldn't write that.

325
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.560
That's not original:
"She's rarely stupid", is she?

326
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:25.360
You can do better than that.
You have a lot of gag writers.

327
00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:27.440
I don't have any gag writers.

328
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.680
I have an editorial team that asks me
I have an editorial team that asks me tough questions, not gags.

329
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.040
Is it a successful insult
that SPD leader Saskia Esken

330
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:41.040
reminds you of a sadistic
civics teacher?

331
00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.880
Successful or flat?

332
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.080
Oh God, that is in the
in the eye of the beholder.

333
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.400
I'll go with Karl Kraus on this one:
"What applies, also applies."

334
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.720
What?
Don't you know it? - Nope.

335
00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:59.400
"What applies, applies."

336
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.000
There may have been some excitement
about this sentence.

337
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.280
But has, I think, at ...

338
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.320
When you
write something like this and notice,

339
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.920
that it causes reactions, you can
you can't be completely wrong.

340
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.800
Then people would say,
what is he talking about?

341
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:20.840
It falls like a pebble
into the water and does not draw waves.

342
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.120
I wasn't listening just now.
Was that important?

343
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.800
It doesn't matter, the people
at the TV were listening.

344
00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.440
After all, we are not cutting today.

345
00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.960
Do you already have something where you think,

346
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.480
Shit, we should have
cut that out? Nah, huh?

347
00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:39.760
The journalist Carolin Emcke
called you

348
00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.960
than Margot Käßmann with a diploma.

349
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.480
Flat or successful?

350
00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:49.280
You are actually the
professional comedian of the two of us.

351
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.160
You have to be able to judge that.
Do you think it's good or stupid?

352
00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.840
I think it's stupid. - Yes.

353
00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.400
If I called you a little
conservative shit bird,

354
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.720
would that be flat or successful?

355
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:07.560
I don't know. In the rbb world
maybe it's comedy,

356
00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.240
as an SPD union cabaret,
I don't know.

357
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.320
Focus Whore. - Oooh.

358
00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.920
Flat or successful?

359
00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:20.080
We are entering what Heinz Strunk
called the death pit of humor.

360
00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.600
Is that so?
Or columnist.

361
00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.760
But why servant?

362
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.560
After all, they are kneeling down.

363
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.560
Because I sit there with calloused
hands and think about what I ...

364
00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:38.720
But you already have such a mask,
somewhat interchangeable,

365
00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:42.480
here something stänkern,
see where they all go.

366
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:45.320
If everyone goes to the left,
I have to go to the right.

367
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.400
I find scorn and derision
as a journalistic style

368
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.840
a beautiful style, it's true.

369
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.360
What I found very flat with you,
was, for example, 2012,

370
00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:59.680
you put down a fat Otto.

371
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:03.080
They compared the Italian people
with the captain

372
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.840
of the wrecked Costa Concordia,
Francesco Schettino.

373
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.560
There were 32 deaths at that time.

374
00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:12.960
You wrote: "Hand on heart,
did it surprise anyone,

375
00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.920
that the captain of the Costa Concordia
of the Costa Concordia is Italian?

376
00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:19.800
Can you imagine,
that such a maneuver

377
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.200
incl. subsequent hit and run

378
00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.640
would have happened to a German or British
would have made?"

379
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.920
Would you write
write it again like that?

380
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.720
The Italian ambassador
has written a letter in response.

381
00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.920
He thought it was racist. - Yes.

382
00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.240
I did not know that the Italians
are a separate people, but good.

383
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:47.640
I always think it's nice
when columns reflect the writing

384
00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:50.120
prove afterwards in the reaction.

385
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.880
I wrote about the
Italians' willingness to offend

386
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.520
made me,
I think 2 years later

387
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:59.960
made fun of the British,
when the Brexit was imminent.

388
00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:01.800
I said good luck,

389
00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:05.560
when the Polish plumbers
are driven from the island

390
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.160
and the toilets
overflow in London.

391
00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.840
The reaction was not a letter
from the British ambassador,

392
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.800
but the Guardian called,

393
00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:17.280
if I could write this again
could write for the English.

394
00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.520
A difference between British
and Italian reaction.

395
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.000
The Italian ambassador
of Germany recommended,

396
00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:28.200
Generalization
based on race.

397
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:32.040
Did you not give a damn
or not put bluntly,

398
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.160
on the butt, on the butt?
I took that very much to heart.

399
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.080
Pinocchio Meatcutter.

400
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.320
We now have 22 minutes.

401
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.360
Do we get
all the questions still asked?

402
00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.920
We go exactly,
I say, by 29 minutes.

403
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.280
I always can not read the clock.

404
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:57.120
29 minutes and
30 seconds we go out.

405
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.680
What question do we still have?
I see.

406
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:05.000
Also to Corona you have
you have an idiosyncratic opinion:

407
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.320
"Says the government, that way,
one has to ask,

408
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.920
does it go somewhere else?"
That's like:

409
00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.760
The rooster crows on the dung,

410
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:15.960
then the weather changes
or stays as it is?

411
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:19.360
With this statement
you think, who wrote it,

412
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.440
Fleischhauer or Confucius?

413
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:23.440
This can really only ...

414
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:27.000
Over the mountain is further
than on foot or something. - Nah.

415
00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.240
When the chancellor says,
we do that,

416
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:33.480
then you also say: Yes, sir?
Nope, of course not.

417
00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:36.800
That's what I said.
Says the chancellor, everyone that way,

418
00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.480
I say,
maybe go that way too.

419
00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.880
You should always praise the chancellor
always praise her, don't you? - Why?

420
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.640
Aren't you CDU? - Nope.

421
00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:48.880
Where did you get that from?
There is such a sense of closeness. - No.

422
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:53.080
You are not with the Greens
because of Habeck, the left is not an option.

423
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:54.840
FDP you could still be.

424
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.240
I can't be with the
not be with the Greens.

425
00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:01.680
If the alternative is worse,

426
00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.280
What is the point
to write it down?

427
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.040
You have obviously not
obviously not understood.

428
00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.880
I'm not writing for what.

429
00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.720
I'm not saying: Vote for Merkel,
Merz or whoever. No.

430
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:16.280
As a journalist, you have to
be against it.

431
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.400
That's why we're not so popular,
if you do the job right,

432
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.040
so when I tease.

433
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.440
You are the only
only mainstream journalist left.

434
00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.920
Doesn't that make you lonely?
I'm not the only one.

435
00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:32.520
You can't call anyone,
they're all filthy.

436
00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.840
I would never use that word,
so AfD talk.

437
00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.720
That's stupid.

438
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:41.160
One is not alone,
if you are the only one,

439
00:24:42.320 --> 00:24:45.320
the others are stupid
and are always to blame?

440
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.560
I have a loving wife,
4 children, I'm fine.

441
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:52.720
They criticize the reporting
reporting at the beginning of the pandemic.

442
00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:54.840
The journalists gave again,

443
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:58.200
what virologist-Pabst
Christian Drosten rendered.

444
00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:05.320
He says the world is a sphere,
do you say: No, a disc?

445
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.360
Live with me
in my media world

446
00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:12.000
or what are you looking at?
I've been watching you for months.

447
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.560
We have bugs
on you and cameras.

448
00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:17.920
It's not about me,
but did you so in March, April

449
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.120
the Corona coverage
seen

450
00:25:21.280 --> 00:25:25.560
The chancellor said the
beautiful phrase that she does not do that,

451
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.480
what she believes, but what
what science tells her

452
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.560
and referred to Mr. Drosten.

453
00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:35.640
Then you quickly realized,

454
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.040
that there is
science does not exist,

455
00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:41.920
but even virologists
were very much at odds with each other.

456
00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.040
There was a little catfight

457
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.960
between Mr. Streeck,
the man from Bonn, and Mr. Drosten.

458
00:25:48.120 --> 00:25:51.240
But they are
all scientists, aren't they?

459
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.280
But with a very strong ...

460
00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.600
But is Mr. Drosten
completely missing the point? - No.

461
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.080
So that one says,
sit down, 6. - No.

462
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:02.560
Obscure, what you give us here ...
There is something in between.

463
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.040
The virus kills us
kill us all, or what?

464
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.640
I am very careful,
You too, right?

465
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.480
Of course,
hence this disc.

466
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.120
Here above all things.

467
00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.960
No, you can't
I can't be accused of anything,

468
00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:18.000
bravely I wear
the FFP-3 mask here.

469
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.520
We have already faded in,
what you wrote about Drosten?

470
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.480
Drosten is the Habeck of medicine,
- with the Habeck you have it -

471
00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:30.080
everything about him meets with approval.

472
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:37.120
So when I read interviews
or read texts about him,

473
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.800
especially in the early days:
He would look so super cute

474
00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:43.200
and this fuzzy hair.

475
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.560
Turnip Habeck.

476
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:49.080
With Habeck, too
every portrait begins with it,

477
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.960
what beautiful hair he had.

478
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:54.920
You as Dr. Brinkmann of
Journalism are jealous or what,

479
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.760
because he has beautiful hair?
That's something in it too, sure.

480
00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:02.960
Then look at Hofreiter,
then it cancels itself out a bit.

481
00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.640
Same party, +/- zero.

482
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:09.400
When you look at him, you think:
Let's just talk about content.

483
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.000
In any case, the journalist is
is not there for adulation.

484
00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.280
You act as if freedom of expression is
is restricted. - No.

485
00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:21.600
But you can write, send,
what you want, no one listens anyway.

486
00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:28.760
Do we still have that in?
We have 27 minutes, 28 seconds,

487
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.440
27 and 30 seconds.

488
00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.560
Freedom of expression is not
restricted. That is nonsense.

489
00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.800
I did not write that anywhere either.

490
00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:42.280
The people, that's interesting,
your viewers, by the way.

491
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:43.920
Mine? - Hm.

492
00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.040
On the television screens,
if you ask them, ...

493
00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.360
YouTube, we are only online first.

494
00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.360
... 71 % say,
that they have the feeling

495
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.840
that you have to be careful
what you say in public,

496
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.600
must be careful.

497
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:02.520
Was a huge excitement,
when there was the survey.

498
00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:06.560
Everything you say stays in,
we don't cut anything out.

499
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:08.440
28:07.

500
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.960
In a column you comment
the case of a young intern,

501
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:15.840
who was harassed by her
was harassed.

502
00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.880
"A moderator writes
text message to the intern at night:

503
00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.560
"3rd floor, room 312".

504
00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:25.400
She is surprised that he
doesn't have a pen and a piece of paper ready,

505
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.040
when she knocks on his door.

506
00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.240
How much unworldliness must
feminists be allowed?" - Yes.

507
00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.040
Are you trivializing
sexual harassment? - Nope.

508
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.440
Why do you write it?

509
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.320
Because I say,
how naive can people be?

510
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.560
The case was like this,
the woman wrote it herself,

511
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:46.760
that's why I wrote it down.

512
00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.440
She writes how she
going out to dinner with this supervisor,

513
00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.760
how he always comes
sexual topics, invites them

514
00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.640
and then at night
writes a text message at 2:30 am.

515
00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.280
There she is surprised,
that he is standing in front of her in a bathrobe.

516
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.920
What did you think?

517
00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:05.880
I would not go to the supervisor's room at 2:30 a.m.
to go to the supervisor's room.

518
00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.400
Well, maybe she thought,
I have to go up there,

519
00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:11.600
Is an emergency or something. - Exactly.

520
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.880
What would you tell your ...?
You have 3 children, right?

521
00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.040
Was she stupid or why ...?

522
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.680
Everyone makes mistakes,
just don't put them in the Süddeutsche

523
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.280
and say:
That was a bad case.

524
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.960
We now have 29 minutes and 27.
One question quickly.

525
00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:33.000
Wait, I'm interested,
what advice would you give your daughter?

526
00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:36.760
The FDP politician
harassed a "Stern" journalist

527
00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:40.520
with insinuating remarks.
Oh, Brüderle affair? - Yes.

528
00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.840
You: The sexism debate here
is an invention,

529
00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.880
because nobody really
debates in public.

530
00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:49.440
What there is,
is indignation and accusation.

531
00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.680
You can't be outraged about it?
We need to go out slowly.

532
00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.520
We have 4 seconds left.
Please come.

533
00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.440
Is it possible to unlock it?

534
00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:03.920
30 minutes, we are at the end,
we'll say goodbye here today.

535
00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.160
What does the clock say?
30 minutes and 7 seconds.

536
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.800
Take care neighbors.

537
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.000
