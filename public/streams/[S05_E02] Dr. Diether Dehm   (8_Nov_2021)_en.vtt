# You are the one for me, for me

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.600
# For me, formidable

# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.840
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.440
Dr. Diether Dehm,
71 years old,

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.040
Politician of the Left Party,
music producer.

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.920
Did this "1000 and one night and
it made Zoom" written,

10
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.160
was the manager of Katharina Witt
and Wolf Biermann.

11
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.000
Has been vaccinated with the Russian
Sputnik V vaccine,

12
00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.720
insulted Foreign Minister Heiko Maas
as a well-styled NATO hustler.

13
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.280
Okay.

14
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.600
Hello, Mr. Dehm.

15
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.240
The "hey" referred
to well styled. - Please?

16
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.640
The "hey" referred
to well styled.

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.640
May I also call you
Putin hustler?

18
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.320
Uh... You may do anything.

19
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.720
As a music producer and manager
they have earned millions.

20
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.400
Claim.
Marxist and multimillionaire.

21
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.400
Isn't that like fucking
for virginity?

22
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.080
No, because the class struggle
against billionaires is just beginning.

23
00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.760
Against monopolies.
I see.

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.080
Because you are a millionaire, you said:
We go for the billionaires.

25
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.160
I always took the position ...
If you were a billionaire now ...

26
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.120
Against the
State Monopolistic Capitalism,

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.880
there is "monopoly" in it,
not "entrepreneur.

28
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.840
Like Bertolt Brecht
entrepreneurs can ...

29
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.880
* Niau * There is nothing growing at all.
Starts well.

30
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.440
As a multimillionaire you have
nothing to do with capitalism?

31
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.520
Yes, one ... - Not until you're a billionaire.
Let me finish.

32
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.440
One can also be
be corrupted as a millionaire.

33
00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.480
But the main enemy is the monopoly,
is the arms industry.

34
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.200
Those who are right ...
These are the bad guys.

35
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.760
The really bad ones.
The really bad ones.

36
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.440
But you are a saint?
On the contrary.

37
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.240
We're looking at...
We have only half an hour.

38
00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.480
We have so much material.
Only half an hour? - Yes.

39
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.320
Ah. - In preparation
for the show I thought:

40
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.240
Fifteen minutes
would have been enough. - Yes?

41
00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.920
So, what one can bear.
What one can bear. - Yes.

42
00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.920
We look at the picture here.

43
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.880
* There you are posing
in Russia in front of the Marx statue,

44
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.680
"Proletarians of all countries,
unite."

45
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.160
That appeals to you, doesn't it?
No, my father ...

46
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.680
(laughs) You are a millionaire,
a multimillionaire even.

47
00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.960
If you want me ...
But Marxist millionaire, M-M.

48
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.520
Try to..,
let me finish.

49
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.360
My father was a works council member,

50
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.280
I come from a
social democratic family.

51
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.160
I am sometime
out of the way

52
00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.720
and the first,
who has become independent,

53
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.840
because I was not allowed to become
in Recklinghausen,

54
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.320
because of too close contacts
with the communists.

55
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.160
I had to become independent
and that's unfortunately what happened.

56
00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.000
But when the Marxist
Revolution comes ...

57
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.240
There are none.
Then you are the class enemy after all.

58
00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.560
There is
no Marxist revolution.

59
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.480
Then Friedrich Engels as an
entrepreneur would also have to be a class enemy.

60
00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.200
Do you still drive the Audi quattro
as a special production? - M-m.

61
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.480
That was 25 years ago.

62
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.720
Do you have another one already?
No, for 25 years ... Yes.

63
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.560
And the high-quality real estate
in Frankfurt do you still have? - Yes.

64
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.880
(laughs) And you want to explain
something about Marxism?

65
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.520
Yes.
* (LAUGHING)

66
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.760
No tenant has complained to the
complained to the Bild newspaper.

67
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.160
You are with the initiative

68
00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.640
"Wealthy
for a wealth tax". - Yes.

69
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.880
Why do you
not surrender the assets?

70
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.120
I do that occasionally,
to Cuba.

71
00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.920
And what is the price range
do we move in?

72
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.520
I'm not going to tell you that.

73
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.840
Where does the coal come from, anyway?
From "touched 1000 times", as quoted.

74
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.880
From the management of BAP,

75
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.640
of 600 songs that I
I have written on record.

76
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.760
"Fist on Fist,
"What do we want to drink?".

77
00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.320
Do we not want
establish the foundation today,

78
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.160
the Diether Gates Foundation?
Diether Gates Foundation? - Yes.

79
00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.320
Very good idea,
incredible play on words.

80
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.240
If you become Chairman of the Supervisory Board
become Chairman of the Supervisory Board, yes.

81
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.560
Why don't you
the money out?

82
00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.680
I'll knock them out,
I said.

83
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.040
I live relatively modestly and spend
relatively much money for world network ...

84
00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.560
But for an Audi quattro
with special equipment is it enough?

85
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.040
It hasn't been for 25 years.

86
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.680
World Network TV,
then I also do left-wing publishers,

87
00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:50.480
publish publications
and occasionally produce CDs.

88
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.960
But where does the coal come from?
Who did you exploit for it?

89
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.720
Those,
who bought my songs.

90
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:02.520
You don't get that much for that.
Back then, you got a lot of money.

91
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.880
I have three or four
platinum records, seven gold LPs.

92
00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.000
Yes. They lead two lives:
Here the successful music producer

93
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.560
and manager,
there the networked politician.

94
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.400
Do you get picked on more for bad songs
or bad politics?

95
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.360
You think the songs are bad?
"Touched a Thousand Times"?

96
00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.840
How old was I then?
Three, or what?

97
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.840
You should have been older.
When did the song come out?

98
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.920
In '84, that was number one.
I'm turning 47 now.

99
00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:36.720
How old was I in '87? Now
let's see if you can do math.

100
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.440
No, I don't know,
when you were born.

101
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.720
I don't think I was
at the time somehow ...

102
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.000
Not, good. And you found the
bad in retrospect as well?

103
00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.120
Yes.
And "fist on fist" too? - Yes.

104
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.920
I see. And ...

105
00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.560
"What do we want to drink" too?
"The soft water"? - Yes.

106
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.760
Many have bad taste.
Complete porridge.

107
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.880
You can see that
from the last federal election. - Yes.

108
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:04.680
This is unbearable.

109
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.160
I tolerate them anyway.
Where did the left stand, at 4.9? - Yes.

110
00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.520
But you have still
saved your ass.

111
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.160
By SÃ¶ren Pellmann in Leipzig,
who was under the umbrella of the opponents.

112
00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.120
Why only 4.9%?
Have you not made any effort?

113
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.640
Because we did not put Sahra Wagenknecht
did not go to the front.

114
00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:29.000
Then we would have been at 12, 15 %.
At 12, 15 or 12.5 %? - 12 to 15.

115
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.880
2,12?

116
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:35.360
We would have had 12 to 15 %,
Sahra Wagenknecht would have been

117
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.000
as candidate for chancellor
has been nominated.

118
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.080
What would Sahra
given us in wrapping paper?

119
00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.280
I believe
most of the points she makes,

120
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.880
are much more realistic
than the vast majority.

121
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.680
That is why, according to polls
she is the second most popular politician.

122
00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.920
So, now it's your turn.
Now we'll show ... Yes yes.

123
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.160
Coulda, woulda, ass-burger.
Now comes that again.

124
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.440
If I had been in politics,
I would have had 98%.

125
00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.160
You asked
why the left is only at 4.9.

126
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.360
That's an uninteresting answer.

127
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:13.080
We'll see the next ...
Oh. - Golden records.

128
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.120
Mm.

129
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.520
Not that you say,
we are demonstrating.

130
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.920
Isn't that with you?
It is, but what is the point now?

131
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.320
We show
Your Golden Records.

132
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.960
Not that people think,
KrÃ¶mer just wants to bullshit.

133
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:28.880
No, no, great.
We show ...

134
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.880
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine can be seen.

135
00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:39.040
Yes, a few are not in the picture.
The point was not to show them.

136
00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.800
Is that at your home or
do you always take the plates with you?

137
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.920
Yes, that's exactly how I do it.

138
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:48.600
Are you in a good mood?
Yes!

139
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.040
You look a little bitter.
No!

140
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.520
I was infected by your bitter
I was infected by your bitter look.

141
00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.840
Are you at operating temperature?
Really fit. Yes.

142
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.680
You must be able to do that as a politician.
I think so too, but hello.

143
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.640
Would you give up all the
Records all give up,

144
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.760
if in return Germany
leaves NATO? - Yes.

145
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.560
You would now have
the chance to get a full set.

146
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.800
I would prefer NATO to be
would be broken up and dissolved,

147
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.080
replaced by a peace alliance,
to which Russia also belongs. - Mhm.

148
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.080
You were
Katharina Witt's manager. - Mhm.

149
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.640
Between 1990 and 1996

150
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:34.400
made with her the TV musical
"The Ice Princess". - Longer still.

151
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.720
What socialist cause was
was it about? Expropriation of Langnese?

152
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.240
The fairy tale even has
a socialist concern,

153
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.840
which was played again and again on ARD
played on Christmas Eve.

154
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.040
Is that so? - Yes.
Isn't that where "The Little Lord" comes from?

155
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:51.120
Always Mrs. Witt?
No, back then.

156
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.400
In any case, it is an ARD product
and it's also about that,

157
00:08:57.560 --> 00:09:02.720
how the charcoal burners in the country
against a rapacious chancellor ...

158
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.360
Capitalist, ne, again.

159
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.400
Or Chancellor, which is set in the
You have to transpose.

160
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.680
A critical political piece.
It has a critical touch.

161
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.840
So for children just barely,

162
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.440
without being told:
FDJ indoctrination of young children.

163
00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:21.600
It's a bit critical, yes.

164
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.280
But you certainly didn't do it
because you wanted to make a profit.

165
00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:29.880
I didn't have any of them,
if I remember correctly.

166
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.960
I see. Did you give everything
Mrs. Witt as a gift?

167
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.280
No, I think,
there was a buy-out and only then,

168
00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.360
when the eleventh or twelfth time
is played on ARD

169
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.280
and the tenth time the ARD ...

170
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.520
You have earned nothing from it?

171
00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:48.160
Deserved
I would have deserved much more anyway.

172
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.760
What did you earn? 9, 10 marks?
I composed the music.

173
00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.320
You must have
have said at some point:

174
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.680
"Let me out,
I have enough money."

175
00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.640
But that is your prejudice!

176
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.920
Proper left-wing entrepreneurs
must also earn.

177
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.200
Yes, so you do deserve.

178
00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:09.760
They are not monopoly capitalists,
who make money from the misery of others.

179
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.400
Did you earn money from it?

180
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.400
Because the songs
are a hardship for you,

181
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.200
have I profited from hardship?
So you have profited.

182
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:21.320
At the plight of Kurt KrÃ¶mer,
to have to listen to these songs.

183
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.640
'97, there I was ...
Everyone else was happy.

184
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.120
With the musical by Katharina Witt
you have earned after all.

185
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.000
I should have earned more,
I gave you...

186
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:35.040
Not that you will become
become a multimillionaire as a Marxist.

187
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.520
You think the songs suck ...
I didn't say that.

188
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.200
They said,
You think my songs are all crap.

189
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.880
No, I did not say that.

190
00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.320
I did. - I may have said
"grits", but not shit.

191
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.440
All right.
You don't do that.

192
00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.040
After all, you are a man with...
After all, you are a guest.

193
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.320
That's no way to treat guests.
True.

194
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.800
You didn't say shit,
but it was meant. - Yes, grits.

195
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.280
Grits, exactly.
It's a matter of taste.

196
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.600
I am a Marxist.
Haha, how funny.

197
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:06.800
But it's funny,
when someone is a multimillionaire...

198
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.240
As a comedian, you have to be funny.

199
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.280
Sure, I'm the ...
What would you say? - Comedian.

200
00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.880
If you talk about me tomorrow?
Comedian.

201
00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.680
The clown from state radio or something?
No, I didn't say that.

202
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:23.600
No, I never said "KrÃ¶mermann" either.
said. That's what I was told.

203
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.960
Shall we rewind?
I never said "KrÃ¶mermann.

204
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.160
State radio, right?
Is that the speech?

205
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:32.520
I consider BÃ¶hmermann to be
a harlequin of the state. - Yes?

206
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.000
But not you, no.
No. BÃ¶hmermann?

207
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.600
Do we want to
about BÃ¶hmermann? - Gladly.

208
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.320
But not now.
It's stupid, he's not there.

209
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.520
I see.
But...

210
00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:47.440
You do not talk about people,
who are not in the room? - Yes, you are.

211
00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.640
But that would be
a bit stupid.

212
00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:53.200
He does five shows against me,
doesn't even invite me.

213
00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.000
They get to chatting.

214
00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.080
You may say what you want,
but not for too long.

215
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.320
12 minutes,
almost half over.

216
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:03.400
No! - Can you still?
Do you want to lie down for a moment?

217
00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:05.240
No, we can do that.

218
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.600
Katharina Witt
took her clothes off for Playboy back then.

219
00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.280
For free, I suppose.
M-m!

220
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:14.880
She got the money,
You, of course, did not.

221
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.120
I was also involved because
get a commission as a manager.

222
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.200
Two, three notebooks? * Woman laughs. *
No, a little more. Haha.

223
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.520
Above ...
The neighbors are having a party.

224
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.200
Is she paid for the fact
that she always laughs?

225
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.600
Yes, we wanted to invite
invite audience.

226
00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.040
But when they heard,
Diether Dehm is coming...

227
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.120
No one came.
No one. Look, please.

228
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.360
No, I...
There could have been one or two.

229
00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:42.080
There is no one at all.
Oh, now everything is broken.

230
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:47.240
Oh, my transmitter.
Is that my station? - No, mine.

231
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:51.000
Can we have a new channel
or a new guest?

232
00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.520
We'll see what's more profitable.
(laughs artificially) Yes.

233
00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:59.960
Can you get it?
Yes, I can.

234
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.360
Is that a Bavarian janker you're wearing?
you're wearing? - Yes.

235
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.080
Are you from Bavaria?
No, but I like these Janker.

236
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.280
I noticed that when I was researching:
They have shirts like this.

237
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:14.600
Oh no. - Don't be
don't be so stupid.

238
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.840
You're doing it on purpose.
No. You have blue fingernails.

239
00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.600
Yes, I sometimes paint my fingers blue
I paint my fingers blue when I'm in a good mood.

240
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.040
Can you hold it like that?
Yes, good, that's exactly how we do it.

241
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.080
Hold a little higher.
If it grinds now ...

242
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.960
Mr. Mielke,
did we get that from the sound?

243
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.400
Beautiful name.

244
00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.960
Or do we want to send in a sound man
in, maybe?

245
00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.120
It looks silly.
Oh, it works.

246
00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:48.920
Then everyone will say, I'm showing you up.
No, no one will ever say that.

247
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.160
I suppress laughter.
* Clack *

248
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.160
Hello!
Come in, it's open.

249
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.720
Mr. Dehm has deliberately
the thing on the floor.

250
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.640
Where is the other part? There.
Oops.

251
00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:02.880
Go ahead and ask.
Yes.

252
00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:06.720
(coughs) No, for the
We need clay for the next chapter.

253
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.640
That's about Wolf Biermann.
Yes.

254
00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.320
You managed that?
Yes.

255
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.440
After his expatriation
from the GDR.

256
00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.360
Now, of course, we have to
talk about the Stasi. - Yes.

257
00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.520
They're taking out the piece of paper now,

258
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.440
where it says that you were not
with the Stasi. - Good.

259
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.560
I show the MAZ at the same time,

260
00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.360
where Wolf Biermann says,
You were with the Stasi.

261
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.160
No, first he comes,
then me.

262
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:39.480
"Do you actually know why and how
we met?"

263
00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:43.000
Just like an old pair of lovers.

264
00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:46.200
"Do you remember the first time
saw each other for the first time?

265
00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:50.120
Can you remember the bench
where we sat?"

266
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:54.240
Of course, one of the two
cannot remember then.

267
00:14:55.120 --> 00:15:00.760
He said, "Well, at that time I had
the order of the state security,

268
00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.160
to make a pass at you,
so that I could get you to be my manager...

269
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.840
mentored."

270
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:14.200
Well, what was going on there?
He's lying.

271
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.960
He's lying? - Yes.
But it didn't look like it to me.

272
00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.200
It may not look like it.
Why should he lie?

273
00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:23.800
Because it was his show to say:
"I come from the East,

274
00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.840
is being persecuted,
come to the West

275
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.840
and the Stasi is back,
in the form of Diether Dehm."

276
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.600
I have a warrant here.
Why are you getting upset now...

277
00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.240
I am annoyed about it,
because the man lies

278
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:38.560
and cites a one-on-one conversation.
He is not in the room.

279
00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.440
I know. - One does not talk
ugly about others...

280
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.680
He has also
in absentia.

281
00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.000
He claims ...
Why did you get so silly about it?

282
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:50.160
In a one-on-one conversation
I would have confessed to him,

283
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.440
to have worked for the Stasi.
Yes.

284
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:55.440
In this one-on-one conversation
no witness was present.

285
00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:59.960
He simply lies and invents something.
What does he get out of it?

286
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.720
I have from the year ...
What does Wolf Biermann get out of it?

287
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.480
That he is putting on a show.
What kind of show?

288
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.800
He staged it, I managed it
for the Stasi.

289
00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.280
Never would the Stasi
come up with the idea.

290
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.280
I have a warrant
from the Stasi. - Yes, I know.

291
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.320
That is what I announced to you.

292
00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:24.960
Either we are the new
comedy duo that goes on tour

293
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.760
and I know that he
the note out now ...

294
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.400
You're welcome to it.

295
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:33.280
Here is a search warrant of the
Stasi against me from the year '78.

296
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.720
It says...
Why did you act so silly?

297
00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:40.240
It says that I am with Biermann,
I am his representative in the GDR,

298
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.240
an entry search and an entry ban will be
an entry ban is imposed.

299
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.800
You can read about that here.
Yes, I know.

300
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.360
Why should the Stasi give me the task
to manage Biermann,

301
00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:53.680
when she makes an APB
against me?

302
00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.760
Why do you get such a pulse?
Because the guy is full of shit.

303
00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:02.080
But that was on television,
everything is true. - Okay.

304
00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.960
What have you been so silly about?
You are a Marxist after all.

305
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:10.320
That's where the Stasi has to be helped.
Biermann has made a turnaround.

306
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:15.600
He was for every NATO war.
Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan.

307
00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:19.320
At that time, when I was
managed, was for peace,

308
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.960
sang peace songs.

309
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.840
He had to justify the turnaround
and he did that,

310
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.800
by
claimed at my expense.

311
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:31.320
But you are a Stasi informant.
No, I was never a Stasi informant.

312
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:36.320
Court decision of the
Frankfurt Regional Court in 1996.

313
00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:40.880
From this ding one may say,
Diether Dehm is a Stasi informant.

314
00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:44.600
Yes, that's what Mrs. Steinbach ...
That's even worse.

315
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.640
Mrs. Steinbach has obtained against me
obtained this judgment by ...

316
00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:52.520
The Steinbach above all.
I would shoot myself in the knee.

317
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.600
The process lasted 20 minutes,
I was not there.

318
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.880
We have all never thought ...
Where have you been? - Somewhere completely different.

319
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.680
How, where, get cigarettes?

320
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.440
We firmly believed that the court
will never decide that.

321
00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:09.200
I was acquitted
by the SPD party court.

322
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.320
But what kind of ...
If I am a spy ...

323
00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:15.600
The Frankfurt State Court
has written that.

324
00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.320
Superior Court.

325
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:20.880
If I had been a spy
of the East would have been,

326
00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.880
it should have been according to Â§ 98 of the Criminal Code

327
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.920
proceedings
against me.

328
00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:29.560
The court has decided,
you are a Stasi informant.

329
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:34.080
Next question. No, I don't want to get
I don't want to get involved right now.

330
00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:37.880
Why has no one ever ...
Question 14. we have 19 minutes.

331
00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.960
Only Biermann claimed that

332
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.640
and you of all people
refer to Mrs. Steinbach.

333
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.880
Do you hear
through the glass badly? - What?

334
00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:51.800
Already at the age of 15 you have Rudi Dutschke
and Cohn-Bendit to the Stasi ...

335
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.800
uh, did you hang out with them

336
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.520
and today, at 71, with Dieter
Hallervorden. Runs with you.

337
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.960
I didn't quite understand that.
Yes, I ...

338
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.080
(loud) They hung out with Rudi Dutschke
and Cohn-Bendit.

339
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.320
Today you are 71 and hang out with
Hallervorden. Works for you.

340
00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:13.200
I demonstrated with Rudi Dutschke
demonstrated against the Vietnam War

341
00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:16.960
and we occupied the stage in '67,
the Amerika-Haus, I was 17.

342
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.720
Now I have with Hallervorden
demonstrated at #AlarmstufeRot,

343
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:22.520
for independent artists,

344
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.080
that will be destroyed by the corona pandemic
will be destroyed. - Item.

345
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.560
And from politics.
Point, cut.

346
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.360
We cut everything to size.
Yes, I know.

347
00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:36.800
They see conspiracy everywhere.
Not everywhere, but many.

348
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.560
In the editorial offices
NATO hacks would be sitting in the editorial offices,

349
00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:41.760
Intelligence services infiltrated everything

350
00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:44.640
and Wikipedia
is a manipulation machine.

351
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.720
Yes - The main writer of
Wikipedia articles, that is, with you,

352
00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:52.680
is a certain Felix.
Yes.

353
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.760
And he is
comrade from the Left Party.

354
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.440
He was a comrade in the Left Party
and that happens by the way ...

355
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:06.000
If you times from May 2006,

356
00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.920
May 17,
read more at Spiegel-Online,

357
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.760
the big swaps
of the journalists ...

358
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.520
We cannot now
read up on anything.

359
00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.920
Conspiracy theorists
then always say:

360
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.840
"You should read the FAZ
from 1921 carefully

361
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:25.800
and at the bottom right is a reptile
and makes wink wink!" - Yes, yes.

362
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.480
We cannot investigate.
Mr. KrÃ¶mer ...

363
00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.200
The BND has 6,500 employees.

364
00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.440
Do you think they hunt all Nazis?
6.500.

365
00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:37.360
They have more employees
than the entire Bundestag.

366
00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:41.600
Could it be that you are
paranoid? - No, and you?

367
00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:45.920
No, I'm not being
persecuted by any people.

368
00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:48.520
And how then do
depression come about?

369
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:52.840
You mean I'm depressed because
secret agents are after me?

370
00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:55.400
No, but you imply

371
00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.640
a psychological crack,
so I ask back.

372
00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.800
But you're not depressed,
because you are being investigated by the CIA

373
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.400
or because Felix ...
Yes, that's my Felix up there.

374
00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.880
I am not para... paranoid.

375
00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:14.080
Paralympic, huh? - I believe that
Agents of the BND also in parties ...

376
00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.720
Unfortunately, we have to ...

377
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:20.240
You are welcome to answer any
question, but must be brief.

378
00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.600
We are now in the next chapter,
on your paranoia.

379
00:21:23.920 --> 00:21:25.480
We look at the picture.

380
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.280
When the forests burned in Siberia,

381
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.320
Karl Lauterbach shared
a short film and noted,

382
00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.880
the fires are the biggest
and most important for climate change.

383
00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.400
A central hotspot
for climate change

384
00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:39.280
would be in Putin's control.

385
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.920
Yes.
So, now it's your turn.

386
00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.360
When forests burn,
is the government to blame?

387
00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.400
Or is that only the case with Putin?
The next picture.

388
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:53.200
This is exactly the same picture.
Ei der Daus! What was going on there?

389
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.360
They took a screenshot and
said Lauterbach was making propaganda

390
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:00.600
for an imperialist
NATO war against Russia.

391
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:03.680
That seems paranoid to me,
Mr. Dehm.

392
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.160
But when he claims,
Putin is to blame for forest fires ...

393
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.680
Isn't that paranoid?
* KrÃ¶mer laughs. *

394
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.040
Isn't that conspiracy theory?
That's who you are.

395
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.200
Putin was to blame for the forest fires.
It burned, he wrote about it.

396
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.000
Yes, but he said,
Putin is to blame.

397
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:24.640
Would you say that when
forests were burning in California,

398
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.880
the governor is to blame?
Then Putin is not to blame.

399
00:22:28.040 --> 00:22:29.520
Very good.

400
00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.960
* KrÃ¶mer sighs. *
I feel a little sick.

401
00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.880
No. - Yes.
Why? - Because it's exhausting for me.

402
00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:39.600
No.
Are you paranoid or not?

403
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.880
I had severe depression,
I also stood by that.

404
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.400
If I were paranoid, I wouldn't know about myself.
I would not know it about myself.

405
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:53.240
They call the mainstream media
as a lying press. - Not true.

406
00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:57.560
They have no fear of contact with
Russian broadcasters and Ken Jebsen.

407
00:22:57.720 --> 00:22:59.360
Mainstream media?

408
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.960
I gave an interview to the Bild-Zeitung and
Ken Jebsen an interview.

409
00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:06.840
That's a dirty rag.
We'll leave them out of it. - No.

410
00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I'm sitting with you, talking to Ken
Jebsen. What's the difference?

411
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.240
This is a Nazi.
No.

412
00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.680
That is not a Nazi.
That's what you say.

413
00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:19.160
Which Felix whispered
whispered to you? - That is not a Nazi.

414
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.960
He is.
He sometimes says some hard things.

415
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:23.960
A few Nazi slogans just.

416
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.520
Name me one
a Nazi slogan from him.

417
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:31.160
Not on the tip of my tongue.
Look! "At the bottom left it says ..."

418
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.960
Exactly, I would have now the FAZ ...
Exactly. You have to learn as well.

419
00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.440
Shall we
put it in after the fact?

420
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.640
Can we do the same
as we did with the Stasi search warrant.

421
00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:44.960
We've seen it before.
There you have ...

422
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:48.440
Is this a photocopy?
Yes, not a real original.

423
00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.120
But at that time the Stasi ...

424
00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.600
This is
your old circus Roncalli trick?

425
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.800
The Stasi
has made me an enemy of the state ...

426
00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:57.400
Oh, oh, oh, 24.
* Clearing throat *

427
00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.800
Interposed question: Do you still have a
still in love with Sahra Wagenknecht?

428
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:05.480
No, I think they're great.
Yes?

429
00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:09.360
Was there something?

430
00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.560
That was in the newspaper, wasn't it?
Where?

431
00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.400
A few years ago. - Really?
That was just a joking question.

432
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.840
You were
with Sahra Wagenknecht?

433
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.920
If you say so now ...
Where did it say that?

434
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.400
Ingrid, write this down.
After 30 years of showbiz, a hit.

435
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.560
If you say so now ...

436
00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:31.160
Diether Dehm.
* smacking noise *

437
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:35.240
What's wrong with him now?
He was together with Sahra Wagenknecht.

438
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:37.160
What was it like?
Tell me.

439
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.560
No, that's...
Don't you want to give anything away?

440
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.680
I don't have a crush anymore,
but I think she's great.

441
00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.600
So, about the coronavirus you have
a song about the coronavirus. - Mhm.

442
00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.640
We showed it to your former
party leader, Ms. Kipping.

443
00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:58.400
Diether Dehm has
wrote a Corona song. - Mhm.

444
00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.120
Let's take a listen.

445
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.600
# What does covid rhyme with?
In any case, profit

446
00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:07.440
# I'm not gonna be threatened with #
# Oh no, no, no, no, no #

447
00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:14.560
I think how Ms. Kipping
feels, there is a word for that:

448
00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:16.360
Cringe.

449
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.920
That was the word?
Yes. - I do not know that.

450
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.120
Well, it was in the newspaper.

451
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.120
Can I say one thing?
Of course.

452
00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:28.200
Not that you say afterwards ...

453
00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.080
Isn't BioNTech currently in the process of
a huge profit business for BioNTech right now?

454
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.720
But that is
wonderful for capitalism.

455
00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.120
He makes something
which hardly holds anything.

456
00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:41.840
Already you need the second
vaccination, the third, the fourth.

457
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.080
Then the state makes sure
that it is bought again.

458
00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.600
And all the media are
pushing and shoving BioNTech.

459
00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:53.440
That's funny. - It's a good thing
I rhymed profit with covid.

460
00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.520
Your statement leads to my question.

461
00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:59.280
They text: "What rhymes with
Covid? Definitely profit."

462
00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:04.080
Oh, I see, must be emphasized differently.
That was my mistake now.

463
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.280
"A young virus
plus ancient powers.

464
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:09.160
Yes, this mix
Makes you horny for our rights." - Yes.

465
00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.680
What are the ancient powers?
Well, big business, for example.

466
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.160
If you are a taxpayer ...
What is big business again?

467
00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:19.200
If you are a taxpayer ...
What is big business?

468
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.520
What is the major capital?
85% of the BioNTech ...

469
00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.560
Mr. Dehm, we have to
start all over again.

470
00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:28.200
You need to explain ...
Rewind.

471
00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.360
If you
Fund 85% of BioNTech,

472
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:35.560
but which go public
and the vaccine patents remain private,

473
00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.560
not be published,
not be given to poor countries,

474
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.560
then that is profit and Covid
rightly rhymes with profit.

475
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:45.840
You write about ancient powers.
Yes.

476
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.720
BioNTech has only been around since
since 2008. - That's right.

477
00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.400
Monopolies and big business
have existed for a long time

478
00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.400
and also the ancient powers that want to
want to destroy the fundamental rights.

479
00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:01.400
Where is the journey taking us now?
What are the great powers of the past?

480
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.160
Well, those who ...

481
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.680
Just name names.
Rewe, Penny, Tengelmann, Kaiser's.

482
00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:09.720
At that time, there were emergency ordinances.

483
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.960
Now scare tactics are being used to justify,
that there are new emergency regulations.

484
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.440
I am in favor of now lifting this
