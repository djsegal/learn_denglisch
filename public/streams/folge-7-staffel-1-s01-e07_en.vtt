00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.720
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.840
You owe me a protocol.
It's in progress.

4
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.200
Of König's films
there is only ever one copy.

5
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.560
We must
solve the problem before the elections.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.840
Bruno?
I need your help.

7
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.200
I have to find Krajewski.
He is the key.

8
00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.360
Look what I have for you,
when you talk.

9
00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.960
That is too weak.

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.640
I thought that would be the right thing
for you flappers.

11
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.800
Kardakov was still there yesterday.
Where?

12
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.240
At the Sorokina apartment.

13
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.600
In Wormsstraße
there's a cellar hole.

14
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.400
This is the headquarters
of the Red Fortress.

15
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.600
Let the train pass.
It is traveling on behalf of the Reichswehr.

16
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
Someone has to sign the papers.
- This is Major General Seegers.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.720
One wagon transports
another load.

18
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.760
We cannot possibly
not possibly examine here.

19
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.120
You will be able to open these boilers
be able to open them.

20
00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.920
Were you at the front?
I've seen it a thousand times.

21
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.800
Looks very
like a gas attack.

22
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.600
Gas!

23
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.680
*She clears her throat.

24
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
Did the newspaper get wet?

25
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.880
Please iron briefly.

26
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.920
(Irmgard) Greta, the coffee please!
- Right away, Mrs. Benda.

27
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.160
*She pours.

28
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.840
Thank you very much.

29
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.480
Yes, thank you.

30
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.960
No.

31
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.280
Here.

32
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.160
Greta, and there ...

33
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.200
the eggs.

34
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.320
And five minutes, please.

35
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.760
Mr. Government Councillor,
madam?

36
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.120
Yes, please?

37
00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.840
I wanted to thank you again
for hiring me.

38
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.680
Uh... Yes, you're welcome.

39
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.240
*noise*
(Margot!

40
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.640
And the children?

41
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.200
I'll go quickly.

42
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.600
We should not wait in the morning
wait for them in the morning, but the other way around.

43
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.680
*The doorbell rings.

44
00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.800
Greta?

45
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:17.560
The door, please.

46
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.440
*The doorbell rings again.

47
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.800
Good morning. Black is my name,
from the pathology department.

48
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.600
I urgently need to speak to Mr.
urgently.

49
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.000
Please.

50
00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.520
Thank you.

*uncanny music

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.760
*rhythmic music

53
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240
*chatter*

54
00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:27.600
(Today I am talking about
the phenomenon of war neuroses,

55
00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.960
also popularly known
as war tremor or fluttering man.

56
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.400
External characteristics are more comprehensive
physical loss of control,

57
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.400
muscular spasms
in all extremities,

58
00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.440
uncontrollable twitching
in the head and face area.

59
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.000
The symptoms of the front-line soldiers,

60
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.480
to whom the gruesome fate
of their generation

61
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.000
is inscribed in their bodies,

62
00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.600
testify to the most disturbing
experiences in the field.

63
00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:00.520
The body punishes the soul for
all these impositions of war

64
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.120
with a revolt.

65
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.920
However, it is also commonly
in professional circles,

66
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.280
that the majority of these cases
of these cases are malingerers

67
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.720
or cowards,

68
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.520
that make use of a medical
marginal phenomenon,

69
00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.880
to evade their social
responsibility.

70
00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.560
However, this must be
must be resolutely opposed.

71
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:27.160
My studies over the
over the last seven years,

72
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.680
that those affected really
suffer from mental disorders.

73
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.760
Let me illustrate this very briefly
with an example:

74
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.400
Private Krajewski, who was
32 years old at the time of his admission.

75
00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.000
We use a three-stage process developed by
three-stage process that I developed.

76
00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:53.160
In the first step, the patient is
sedated with barbiturates

77
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.920
and by means of accompanying suggestion

78
00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.160
into a hypnotic state
state.

79
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.320
(Hypnosis.
*laughter*

80
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:04.520
In hypnosis
we lead the patient back

81
00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.400
to the source of his trauma.

82
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.680
To the horrors of war.

83
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.280
The images of memory
penetrate into the depths of it,

84
00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.240
what we call the subconscious.

85
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.240
We? Who is "we"?
- Is there also a superconscious?

86
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.400
*laughter*

87
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:28.520
In the second step
we carry out projective tests

88
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.920
according to the method
Professor Rorschach through ...

89
00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:34.160
Bells and whistles!
*mumble*

90
00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.560
This allows us to localize
the personality disorder more precisely

91
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:43.000
and then very slowly approach
the patient's consciousness.

92
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.280
Only now does the third

93
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.520
and decisive phase
of our treatment.

94
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.120
The patient's trauma
is addressed directly,

95
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.120
in full consciousness.

96
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.960
Talk therapy

97
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.880
the treatment can then
lead to lasting success.

98
00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:02.640
*mumbling*
(That's humbug!

99
00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.160
Where is that supposed to go?
Electricity, colleague.

100
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.720
Have you ever heard of muscle spindles?

101
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.120
The problem has long since been solved,
by the death of those affected

102
00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.200
or the symptoms have
have decreased over the years.

103
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.000
*murmuring in agreement*

104
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.360
But the closed institutions
are full to bursting with them.

105
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.800
I'm talking about 1,000, 10,000 men.

106
00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.360
That's a good thing,
when they're all gone.

107
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:31.840
*agrees*
The brain is not a poetry album.

108
00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:34.360
Many of them are war heroes,

109
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.600
wiped away and systematically
removed from our everyday lives.

110
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.640
Because they remind us
remind us of a catastrophe,

111
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.480
which certain circles
in this country

112
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.960
has long since been glorified again.

113
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.880
They are weaklings!

114
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.720
They sully
the reputation of our army!

115
00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.280
Cowards!
- They are shirkers!

116
00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.400
Dr. Schmidt, you are a disgrace
for our profession!

117
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.440
Cure!
- Pseudoscience!

118
00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.920
Colleague, you are intolerable!
- Outrageous!

119
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.680
(man) ... Millions of visitors,
the Jews, the prices ...

120
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:21.000
And only ugly women.
The bad food.

121
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.880
The worst food ever.
The stalest beer.

122
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.880
And the poverty.
Rashes and scabies and ...

123
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.160
Am I right or am I right?

124
00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.000
I actually feel
quite comfortable here.

125
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.840
Tsk! "You're crazy, my child.
You have to go to Berlin."

126
00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.360
(sings) "Where the crazies are,
that's where you belong."

127
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.800
Thank you very much.

128

*dark music*

129
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.360
Reverend, how can I
be of assistance to you?

130
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.960
*dark music*

131
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.680
Dr. Schmidt sent me.

132
00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.920
From now on, this is the medicine
for the patient,

133
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.600
who was just there.

134
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.280
Barbituric acid derivative.

135
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.720
For the first step
of the procedure.

136
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:48.160
*Doorbell rings.

137
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.920
*exciting music*

138
00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:04.200
Attention ... ready ... go.

139
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:08.000
(So Kardakov
was just pretending,

140
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.640
as if he were a musician?

141
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.480
No, I don't believe it,

142
00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:14.840
but right now he is
mainly revolution.

143
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.480
Lights out, knives out!

144
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.360
Here you go.

145
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.280
Thank you.

146
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.480
And because of the black lung
you think now,

147
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.240
dit's a railroad man?

148
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.520
Exactly.

149
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.640
Well combined, Toni.
Let's have a look.

150
00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.640
Where did you get the stamp?
Borrowed.

151
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.600
Looks real, doesn't it?

152
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.280
It says "police".

153
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.560
Nobody really knows.
The main thing is official.

154
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.000
Press-Police Ritter.

155
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.440
Try your clever little head
for school.

156
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.760
You are stupid. Can't I come with you?

157
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.960
To the station?
You must be beeping or something.

158
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:12.720
What then?

159
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.760
Give me a little something, will you?
I can't take any more.

160
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.840
First the negative and the copy.
Everything.

161
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.720
They do the same to me
like ... with König.

162
00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:48.160
König shot himself.
But not voluntarily.

163
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.720
We'll be back.
You can think about it for that long.

164
00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.560
But I can't think anymore!
Yes, yes.

165
00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.960
*Door closes.

166
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.600
*exciting music*

167
00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:20.120
Boiler AB-3221:
positive for phosgene.

168
00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.360
Right, let's go over to the 64.

169
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.680
How do you do?

170
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.920
Tagchen.

171
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.800
You look like someone
who can help me.

172
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.400
Well, then ...

173
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.560
I'll help you.

174
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.720
Do you see? I told you.

175
00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.880
Yeah, me too.
 Good.

176
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.400
Then comes now
my all-important question.

177
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.280
Come on now.

178
00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.240
How many trains from Russia
arrive here per week?

179
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.840
Two, three, I'd say.

180
00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:02.000
And when was the last one?

181
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.600
Well, three days ago.
The one where there was a bang yesterday.

182
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.800
Banged ...

183
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.320
Exactly.

184
00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:13.960
Kss, Werner!

185
00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.360
Who is ditte?

186
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.920
Madamchen is ...
From the press.

187
00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.280
From the juicer?
How you take it.

188
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.720
Berliner Illustrierte.
Oh, my old lady always reads it too.

189
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.200
Do you have a pass for that?
Yes.

190
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.480
Good.

191
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.720
I heard,
a train car blew up.

192
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:42.480
Oh, stop it!
That's all we need.

193
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:45.400
Thanks to you, fox.
Do you still have a light?

194
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.800
Some egghead
has opened the hatch and psssss!

195
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:53.240
It was quite a whistle.

196
00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.960
In any case, it has
'n a few of our boys.

197
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:59.240
And since then ... You can see that.

198
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000
And inside?

199
00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:07.200
There are some specialists
from Nyssen AG are investigating.

200
00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.160
And who are the coat wearers?
They're all Russians.

201
00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.360
secret service
or what do I know.

202
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.280
Ever since the thing flew up,
they've been there.

203
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.200
It was also a Soviet train.

204
00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.280
Can I have a look?

205
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:25.280
Frollein, you're a brand.

206
00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.840
That's why I'm standing here.
To make sure nobody gets in.

207
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:38.880
*Birds chirping

208
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.840
(man, muffled) What? Yesterday?
That can't be true.

209
00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.760
How could this happen?

210
00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.560
Are you sure,

211
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.480
that the Russians
were not involved?

212
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.800
Yes, I've read it,
a chemical accident ...

213
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.160
Good.

214
00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:17.200
Agreed.

215
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:19.160
Let's do that.

216
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:25.400
Good, they should examine the wagons
and if ...

217
00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.640
And if you find something
they would like to have, then please!

218
00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.360
Yes, I'll calm down.

219
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.440
Yes, I agree.

220
00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.640
Excellent, Wegener.

221
00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.600
Excellent. Yes.

222
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.120
Goodbye, Wegener.

223
00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.360
Good morning.

224
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:03.320
And after 5 pm,
what happens to your life?

225
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.680
Nothing special.
That can be changed.

226
00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.360
I'll think about it.

227
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:10.360
Who dares, wins.

228
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.200
I'm going to think very hard
think about it.

229
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:16.640
Careful, girl!
That boy is dangerous.

230
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.520
Not for nothing
his nickname for nothing.

231
00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760
What is it?

232
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.800
Reinstecke Fuchs.
*laughter*

233
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.280
Nice guys.

234
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.880
The two of us, that would have been it ...

235
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.000
Yes, that's a real shame.

236
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.520
Well, then ...

237
00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.880
*exciting music*

238
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:00.240
Dismount!

239
00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.280
Spread out! Zack, zack!

240
00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.880
Get moving!
- Speed, speed, speed!

241
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.000
*exciting music*

242
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.920
Open the gate!
- Yes, but ...

243
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.800
Open the gate!

244
00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:20.720
Wait, no entry!

245
00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:24.120
Search!
Everyone will be searched!

246
00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:25.560
Line them all up!

247
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.920
The two of them search.

248
00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:36.600
Bang, bang, bang!
- Everyone get up from the table! Quickly!

249
00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.000
Line up here!

250
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.920
Search all!

251
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.320
Come on, give me your weapons!
- What are you doing?

252
00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.480
You are responsible,
I presume?

253
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.680
What makes you think that?

254
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:52.560
Benda, Berlin Police, Department 1.

255
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.720
Left pocket:
My diplomatic identity card.

256
00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.000
*murmur of voices*

257
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.400
*exciting music*

258
00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:15.640
(Policeman) That's all of them now.

259
00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.600
Are they registered?

260
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:22.600
Good, then you can
them all tomorrow

261
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:26.880
on presentation of an ownership card
at the Presidium.

262
00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:30.400
(Benda) So, gentlemen,
that's nice,

263
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.840
that you do the work for us.

264
00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.920
Then show us the analyses.
What's in the wagons?

265
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.720
Rath?

266
00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.480
It's me.
What's up?

267
00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.960
I'm at the Anhalter freight station.

268
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:47.800
You'd better come here.
I won't kick you out again.

269
00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.800
It's about something else.
What is it?

270
00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.200
I came across a lead.
The dead Russian.

271
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:54.440
What?

272
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.120
(Benda) That's it for now.

273
00:18:57.360 --> 00:19:02.400
Whether this is an internal Soviet
matter, we will see.

274
00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:04.640
The matter
will certainly be handled internally

275
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.160
- as the Germans say -
make some waves.

276
00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:11.280
This will not
be prevented.

277
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.400
Mr. Government Councillor?

278
00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.280
The chemists
have taken random samples,

279
00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.240
so far only from three wagons.

280
00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.200
How did you get here?

281
00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:32.280
How did you know about the station?
I'll tell you later.

282
00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.200
How many wagons
are there actually?

283
00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:36.440
A total of 13.

284
00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:38.360
Stop, no entry!

285
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.440
I'm from the club.
Nevertheless: restricted zone.

286
00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:42.920
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280
Rath?

288
00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:46.640
Rath!

289
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.800
Mr. Government Councillor.

290
00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.320
What are you doing here?

291
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:58.960
The driver of this train
was probably murdered.

292
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.200
Please?

293
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.720
His body was floating in the Spree.
In the Landwehr Canal.

294
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.360
Who is that?
That's Miss Ritter.

295
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:07.680
Typist.

296
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.280
Mr. Government Councillor?
Could you please take a moment.

297
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.320
I want to know more.

298
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.320
Are you going with me?
Yes, fine.

299
00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:19.200
(man) All samples tested positive
for phosgene.

300
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.840
Am I going too?

301
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:22.800
No.

302
00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.600
Come and see us.

303
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:26.520
Early evening, Aschinger?

304
00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:29.800
Half past six should work.
Good.

305
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.840
Phew.

306
00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:49.920
"Juicer".

307
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:55.360
(Benda) What I am about to tell you,
is subject to the strictest secrecy.

308
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.160
Stored in the engine shed
13 times serious treason

309
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.200
for the illegal import
of warfare agents.

310
00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.920
Smuggling from the Soviet Union.
On the increase for years.

311
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.800
What exactly is being smuggled?

312
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.760
Initially conventional weapons,
small quantities,

313
00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.920
then always coarser cutlery.

314
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.200
Anti-aircraft shells,
Tanks, heaviest artillery.

315
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.400
And now poison gas.
That's really new.

316
00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:22.160
Who is introducing all this?

317
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:26.440
Have you ever heard of
the "Black Reichswehr"?

318
00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.800
Just rumors.

319
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.880
Secret military,
irregular combat units ...

320
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.560
You use
your disguised arms deliveries

321
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:38.480
a network of straw men,
always others.

322
00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:41.760
But behind it all
the Black Reichswehr.

323
00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.800
But how can you prove that?
They don't officially exist.

324
00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.680
The body of the railroad worker
exists in any case.

325
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:51.960
Maybe that's a scent.

326
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:55.320
The case may be of the utmost importance
for us.

327
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.400
Make sure you stay tuned.

328
00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.520
I need every clue,
that narrows down the suspects.

329
00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.960
Who ordered the delivery from Russia
ordered?

330
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.640
Alfred Nyssen.
From the steel group?

331
00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.880
Yes, one of their puppets,
I suppose.

332
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.400
Let's take a closer look at it next
a little closer.

333
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.600
The goal of these people
is nothing less

334
00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.600
than the dismantling
of our democracy.

335
00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.400
*exciting music*

336
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.880
*exciting music*

337
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120
And?

338
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.680
*exciting music*

339
00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.280
The case of Willi Schulze
has priority.

340
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.680
You two check out the neighbors.

341
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.680
Norbert,
you go to the "Red Cat".

342
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:12.840
And in the "Eldorado"
a new team is playing.

343
00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:15.280
That's where we smuggle John in.

344
00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:19.120
All clarity removed?
Off you morons!

345
00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:22.160
Ah, you're spot on, friend.

346
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.920
Already got plans tonight?
We're having a little party.

347
00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.960
I want to introduce you to someone:
Guest of Honor.

348
00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:30.760
It starts at seven.

349
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.880
That's nice, Bruno, but ...
Yes, nothing there.

350
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.680
You have to be around people.
You'll give me a tantrum here.

351
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.800
Here you are at last.

352
00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.640
Well, we have a date.

353
00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.000
Can you be brief? Thank you.

354
00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:25.760
Did Mr. Wolter
didn't even tell you,

355
00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.400
that you can take me with you?

356
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.480
Thank you.

357
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.640
Well, then ...

358
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.840
Wormsstrasse.

359
00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:51.240
Köpenick.

360
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.200
*she sighs.

361
00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:58.960
Where is he?

362
00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.400
What's wrong now?
Is someone else coming?

363
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.640
Actually ...
I need the table.

364
00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.640
Oh, there he is.

365
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.400
Stefan!

366
00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.160
Charlotte!
What are you doing here all alone?

367
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.320
Waiting for you.
Because we still have plans.

368
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:24.360
Do you have time?
Both of us?

369
00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.880
Yes, numbers!

370
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:29.360
A short trip to Köpenick.

371
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.360
Gentlemen, sorry.

372
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:35.560
Major Scheer asked me
for his demonstration

373
00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:37.400
to absolute darkness.

374
00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.000
Mauser K 97, officially prohibited.

375
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:49.920
Comrades ...

376
00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.400
Captain Wolter and I
have the honor,

377
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:57.240
present to you this evening the prototype
of the Zieldrei.

378
00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.880
Why darkness?

379
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:02.400
Well, this model
is an absolute world first.

380
00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.880
Powder alloying of the reticle filaments
with radioactive radium

381
00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.200
has succeeded,

382
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.160
a functional telescopic sight
for the dark.

383
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.000
Which for the first time
the use of the sniper ...

384
00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.360
is possible in the dark.

385
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.880
So, that's what I understood
at the station:

386
00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.720
There was poison gas on the train,
no pesticides.

387
00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.640
And poison gas is forbidden.

388
00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:35.560
That's why Benda
confiscated the train.

389
00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:39.920
And the railroad worker who was found dead
was found dead in the Landwehr Canal,

390
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.680
Evening.
- Good evening.

391
00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.880
... who brought the train
to Berlin.

392
00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:50.760
He belongs to this organization.
They call themselves the "Red Fortress".

393
00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.680
Strange,
looks so deserted here.

394
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.560
How do you know all this?
I found out.

395
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800
I see.

396
00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.800
*loud clink*

397
00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.000
Gosh, Charlotte,
what are you doing?

398
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.280
There's no one here anyway.

399
00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.800
Take a look,
the putty is not dry.

400
00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.760
Ah.
 Are you crazy?

401
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.760
Here is the key.

402
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.520
We can't just go in there.
Yes, we can.

403
00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:45.800
*Door squeaks.

404
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:48.680
*It cracks under her footsteps.

405
00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.360
*exciting music*

406
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:14.760
As clean
as on delivery.

407
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.400
Why are they renovating here?
I have no idea.

408
00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:24.400
What would the chief inspector
do now?

409
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.960
Wolter?
Yes.

410
00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.560
Book the person who stole his
who stole his time, and have dinner.

411
00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.640
And Rath? What would he do?
Silence.

412
00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.320
Then the eyebrows ...

413
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.600
No, seriously now.

414
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:47.160
Charlotte?

415
00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.320
Pull the lever here.

416
00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:07.800
A roller king.
What?

417
00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:10.680
That's what leaves are called,
that are still hanging in the press.

418
00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:11.920
I see.

419
00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.320
What does it say?

420
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.520
From the railroad.
"AB-3221".

421
00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.720
"Istanbul.

422
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400
Istanbul?

423
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.320
What does the Red Fortress want
with poison gas in Istanbul?

424
00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:33.360
Oh, it's great that you're here!

425
00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.200
Here. Potato salad.
- Good. Come in.

426
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.360
Gereon. The men are already upstairs
at Scheers. Right over here.

427
00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:43.200
Ah.
See you later.

428
00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.760
Thank you.

429
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:50.240
*chatter*

430
00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:53.880
(Boy) The railroad line
from Ypres to Comines.

431
00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.480
May 5, 1918 at 8:45 am,

432
00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:03.120
the second offensive
of the 30th Infantry Division

433
00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.200
under General Heisen.

434
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.800
Heavy artillery
on the opposite side.

435
00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:12.960
The British respond
with a barrage.

436
00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:14.760
*small explosions

437
00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:16.960
Hand grenade launcher squads.

438
00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.400
Only Combat Battalion 31
reaches the hilltop.

439
00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.840
Colonel Seegers is in command.

440
00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:28.280
Our men in the crossfire
between Zwarteleen and Zillebeke.

441
00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:32.440
The enemy ring is blown up,
the height is taken

442
00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.280
and is handed over to the commander-in-chief
of the division.

443
00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.320
At exactly 7.51 pm.

444
00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.960
*tick*

445
00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:44.440
*tick*

446
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.800
Comrades.

447
00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.160
*Heels strike against each other.

448
00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:54.400
Today we commemorate the many
fallen of our unit.

449
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.320
Rahn, Müller, Zangert, Widemann,

450
00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:09.360
Fischer, Behnke, Michaelis, Kohn.

451
00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.880
(all) Favors for Germany.

452
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:15.760
Honor her memory.

453
00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:23.240
Winkelmann, Hase, Röhler, Kuhnert,
von Dülmenau, Rosen.

454
00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:29.360
(all) The German army:
undefeated in the field.

455
00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:31.960
Who betrayed us?

456
00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.800
(all) social democrats!

457
00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:43.480
(sings) "I had a comrade,

458
00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.960
You won't find a better one."

459
00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:53.800
(all join in)
"The drum beat for the fight,

460
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.840
he walked by my side

461
00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.800
in the same step and stride,

462
00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:07.800
in the same step and stride."

463
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:12.160
"A bullet came flying."

464
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:16.320
"Is it for me or is it for you?"

465
00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:21.440
"It tore him away."

466
00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.800
"It lies at my feet,
as if it were a piece of me."

467
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.200
*heavy breathing

468
00:32:37.800 --> 00:32:38.920
*irregular breathing

469
00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.360
(Retreat!

470
00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.480
*irregular breathing

471
00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:49.240
(Man yells) Retreat!

472
00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.240
*Someone whistles a tune.

473
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.800
*whimper*

474
00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:35.160
*whimper*

475
00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.440
(Gereon!

476
00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:45.720
Gereon.

477
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.720
Gereon.

478
00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.680
"... as if it were a piece of me."

479
00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:58.160
"As if it were a piece of me."

480
00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:15.160
So, comrades.

481
00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.280
If I could now
downstairs now?

482
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.680
Emmi and the ladies
prepared snacks with the ladies.

483
00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:22.920
Comm.

484
00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:30.800
Arndt.

485
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:35.240
Arndt, you did a great job.
The father rehearsed it.

486
00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:39.880
Yes, but you delivered it.
With dignity and appropriate to the day.

487
00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720
Stir.

488
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.280
Nyssen AG is
a large steel producer.

489
00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.720
We will unleash a storm.

490
00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:52.760
(Benda) Alfred Nyssen has
ordered the freight personally.

491
00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
For this he must
before the law.

492
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:58.560
The evidence seems overwhelming.

493
00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:02.920
(Benda) These people hate
social democracy and the Jews.

494
00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:06.920
With the establishment of Nyssen
we have the opportunity,

495
00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:09.840
for the strengthening
of the Republic.

496
00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.120
(Zörgiebel) Agreed.

497
00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.320
(Benda) Ready for the storm?

498
00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:19.600
(Zörgiebel) Yes, this is the opportunity,
we have been waiting for.

499
00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:21.720
I wish you every success.

500
00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.480
Good night to the President.

501
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:29.880
*Door is opened
and closed*.

502
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.240
Miss Overbeck?

503
00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.920
Mr. Government Councillor?

504
00:35:36.920 --> 00:35:39.480
I don't have to tell you
that everything,

505
00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.240
what you hear in this house
comes to your ears,

506
00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:45.800
strictest secrecy
is subject to.

507
00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.800
No, I know that.

508
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.640
This also applies to our visitors,
who come and go here.

509
00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:55.400
Yes, indeed. The madam
explained everything to me.

510
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:56.480
Very good.

511
00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:09.560
*He chooses.

512
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.360
Sebald? Benda here.

513
00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.640
Arrange for the arrest of
Alfred Nyssen, please.

514
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.720
*swinging music*

515
00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.480
*murmur of voices*

516
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.720
*Snippets of conversation

517
00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.480
You are so beautiful.

518
00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.320
I'm so glad
that she's going out again.

519
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:31.880
I'm going out.

520
00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.800
You're far too young
to sit at home.

521
00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:38.200
Emmi, please!
- This dress looks great on you.

522
00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:40.360
Don't you think so?
Yes, I do.

523
00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.200
Do you see?
The commissioner sees that too.

524
00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.800
They don't give me that impression.
I would be sorry.

525
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:49.400
You are hardly ever seen
at home.

526
00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:50.840
Well, the work ...

527
00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:54.360
Oh, I thought so,
You were on the run.

528
00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:55.600
Sorry.

529
00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:59.000
There is someone here,
who knows a Rath from Cologne.

530
00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.760
There are a few raths.

531
00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.840
From the 22nd Infantry,
Army Group West.

532
00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:05.200
Ah.

533
00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.440
Excuse me, please.
Emmi, Mrs. Behnke ...

534
00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:17.400
He is still unattached.
I asked him the other day.

535
00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960
Is that him?
- Yes, it is.

536
00:37:22.760 --> 00:37:24.400
Major General?

537
00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:27.600
This is Inspector Rath,
our colleague from Cologne.

538
00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:30.320
Ah. Seegers, how do you do?
Good evening.

539
00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:33.440
The captain said,
You knew a council?

540
00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:37.400
Yes, there was a council in
Emmerdingen during the staff formation.

541
00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:39.920
Anno Rath?
Could be. A cheerful guy.

542
00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.120
Could jump from a standing position
jump onto any table.

543
00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.120
And that's what he did.

544
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:48.400
This is my brother.
Charming, funny ...

545
00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:51.640
When he entered a room,
barely two minutes passed

546
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:55.000
and everyone spoke
either with him or about him.

547
00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:58.520
And the women's rooms,
as far as available,

548
00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:01.240
ran after him by the dozen.

549
00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.560
I know what you're talking about.

550
00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.240
Where is your brother now?

551
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.800
(Retreat!

552
00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.720
Are you deaf? Retreat!
My brother is still alive!

553
00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:22.760
*serious music

554
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.000
(Gereon?

555
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.880
(desperately) Gereon!

556
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.320
(Gereon!

557
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.520
*quiet music

558
00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.520
*heavy breathing

559
00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.400
*whimper*

560
00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.160
Thank you, Gereon.

561
00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.880
Thank you.

562
00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.280
*You speak French.

563
00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.400
No! Anno!

564
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:11.120
*He sighs.

565
00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:13.200
I was captured

566
00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:16.240
and was forced to
to leave Anno behind.

567
00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:19.520
Captivity?

568
00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.840
Three months.

569
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:24.200
And no sign of your brother?

570
00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:29.640
Dozens of search requests: War
care, Red Cross, everywhere.

571
00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.240
He holds the fort in secret
the position,

572
00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:37.520
to which we will return,

573
00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.760
as soon as we repeat ourselves,
what belongs to us.

574
00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.560
*quiet piano music

575
00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:06.400
*quiet piano music

576
00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.840
Alfred Nyssen?

577
00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.360
Come with us.

578
00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:26.760
*quiet piano music

579
00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:32.520
*Door closes.

*quiet piano music

*quiet piano music

583
00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:41.160
*He breathes hastily.

584
00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:46.000
*whispering voices*

585
00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.520
*Krajewski whimpers.
