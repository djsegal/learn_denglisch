00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
.

2
00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.720
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me,

3
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.840
# for me, formidable.

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.400
# You are my love,
very, very, very veritable. #

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.200
(Berlin dialect)
We'll have a look,

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.920
what the cat today
put in front of the door.

7
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.080
Jacky-Oh Wine House,
34 years old.

8
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.400
Travesty artist,
activist,

9
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.800
presenter and
self-proclaimed part-time girl.

10
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.320
Jacky?
Yes.

11
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.440
Shit,
I still have the sign on it.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.600
What?
You, I am pleased.

13
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.760
Well.
Don't you?

14
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.880
We will see.

15
00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.800
It was agreed
that we would meet.

16
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.120
I'm looking forward to seeing you now.

17
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.160
What did you think,
what comes now?

18
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.080
The Kelly Family?
Yes, they come as a surprise.

19
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.560
I'm coming in.
Okay!

20
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Hi!
You are smoking.

21
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.760
No.
Moment.

22
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.560
I have used the "big one
used on the floor.

23
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.200
You can smoke.

24
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.200
From a purely legal point of view, it's like this:
I would be allowed to smoke if I ...

25
00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.280
Hello Kurt.
Greetings.

26
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.280
Wine house.
We know each other.

27
00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.640
Should I tell Mrs. Weinhaus
because we're on TV?

28
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.600
You can say Barbara.
Jacky I would like to say.

29
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.600
On Sundays and holidays Jacqueline,
otherwise Barbara.

30
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.960
Hi.
You smoke, I don't smoke anymore.

31
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.160
I only smoke
these funny electric things.

32
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.440
These crayons?
I can't concentrate.

33
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.080
I make out.

34
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.720
I've been pulling this shit for years
with my guests:

35
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.280
Bothering me with this shit.
You are a reproachful one.

36
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.800
Do you want something to drink?
I see something urine-colored.

37
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.960
What is this?
You have no glass, but there is ...

38
00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.600
Do you want urine?
Yes, with pleasure.

39
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.640
Wait.

40
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.600
It tastes best when warm.
Super sweet.

41
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.960
I also tape everything with gaffa,
even my nipples.

42
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.880
That is so.
Also the willy?

43
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.600
No.
Yes.

44
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.360
That is called taping.
Now ask how I know that.

45
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.200
Internet?
No.

46
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.400
From RuPaul's Drag Race.

47
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.800
You do it like this
and take the tape.

48
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.800
No.
I am a little more restrained.

49
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.400
What?
I'm nimble when it comes to that.

50
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.320
I have a
very tight tights underneath.

51
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.960
It keeps everything in shape.

52
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.040
I pull a pair of shrill panties
over it, and everything is wrapped up.

53
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.480
We know each other.
You asked me once.

54
00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.000
We have
talking about the queer community.

55
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.280
You asked me,
I thought that was cool:

56
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.400
Why have you never
never dealt with it before?

57
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.440
You said that nicely.
That was quite nice.

58
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.600
I thought:
Why didn't I do that?

59
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.280
I can explain it to her.
Go ahead.

60
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.920
It is a minority.
It is of little concern to you.

61
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680
That's why you don't
you do not deal with it.

62
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.120
Not
For self-defense reasons.

63
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.600
Dental hygiene of homeless people
in Berlin-Charlottenburg

64
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.000
I am also not very concerned,
therefore I sit down little

65
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.720
with donation projects for
apart.

66
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080
Educational mission of travesty is:

67
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.200
Be a little open
and look at people,

68
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.680
one or the other
little tangent.

69
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.600
Nevertheless go up to it
and think to yourself:

70
00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.080
They are also part of society.

71
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.720
What are you doing?

72
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.400
Swim in the pool
and listen and watch.

73
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.520
You don't have to touch it. That is
often read as encroaching.

74
00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.240
Walk through the world with an open ear,
Do not leave people alone.

75
00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.840
Say, is it all right to say
what your real name is?

76
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.080
Or do you say "no."
That is a matter of definition.

77
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.760
Artists, so ...
What is real?

78
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.080
What is real?
What is my real name?

79
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.920
What is really in the name
and what about the artist's name?

80
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.640
True.

81
00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.160
Touche.

82
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.120
Now we break off.
That's it, come home safely.

83
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.320
I have now made a mistake.
No, not at all.

84
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.080
Awesome that you said it.
Yes.

85
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.120
For people
with an immigrant background,

86
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.880
if you were black,

87
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.360
this stupid question:
Where are you from?

88
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.120
Then you say:
I come from Mannheim.

89
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.880
Then I ask again:
But where are you really from?

90
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.000
Was that such a question:
What's your real name?

91
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.840
No, the everyday racism situation
is something completely different.

92
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.560
Yes.

93
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.360
Basically, it's like this: There's a
a bit of sensitivity.

94
00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.960
It's not an attack in general.
Yes.

95
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.040
It's also because
because you have zero idea,

96
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.680
what my identity is:
gender or sexual.

97
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.600
You see me and think:

98
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.200
This is a gay man,
who likes to wear mini dresses.

99
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.120
That's why you assume,

100
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.560
that the male name on my ID card
male name is the "real" one.

101
00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.160
But it is not.
Is both?

102
00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:04.200
What?
Jacky and your name.

103
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.640
You can also say Sebastian.

104
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.280
When someone says Sebastian,
I think of my parents.

105
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.960
Then I know:
I fucked up,

106
00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.880
the shit has hit the fan,
take cover.

107
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.000
Friends say Basti.
No, wine house.

108
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.920
Sebastian, look at your room
and tell me

109
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.600
What comes to your mind?

110
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.440
Tights and eye shadow
probably

111
00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.000
Wine house is the most popular.
But you can also say Jacky.

112
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:31.720
I say Jacky.
Yes, gladly.

113
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.600
I say Kurte, too.
Kurti.

114
00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.320
Knotweed.
Krömerin you called me.

115
00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.280
Yes, Krömerin.
I have brought nail polish.

116
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.440
If you like,
if it gets dry.

117
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.920
Now watch this. Yesterday I watched
"Maybrit Illner yesterday.

118
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.800
Then they said: We'll get to that.
And then?

119
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.960
Nothing.
Then it came to that, but.

120
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.040
That's cool,
because otherwise I'm against the guests ...

121
00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.560
What was the Maybrit about?
We'll get to that in a moment.

122
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.240
Cool.
Call me Maybrit.

123
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.880
Then I would like you to call me
Frau Maischberger.

124
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.160
Ms. Maischberger.
So, we're going to come ...

125
00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.680
What does ...
That is the question:

126
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.200
Who are we addressing?
To all.

127
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.680
Are we targeting everyone?
Yes.

128
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.880
Let's address people,
who do not know

129
00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.200
what travesty is,
Drag, gay, lesbian?

130
00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.680
I would like to address everyone.

131
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.960
Even in the queer community

132
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.920
is "queer"
an umbrella term for everything,

133
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.760
what does not follow the hetero-mainstream
follows.

134
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.120
You can also be queer as a heterosexual
oriented woman to be queer.

135
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.440
Take a look at yourself in the mirror?

136
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.120
Are you stupid?
I'm looking you in the eye.

137
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:47.200
No, you always look like that.
Dude, I'm looking you in the eye.

138
00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.360
I am Maybrit, please.
Old woman.

139
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.080
Mrs. Illner.
Old Illner.

140
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.200
So, we're addressing everybody.
Yes.

141
00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:03.120
What does LGBTQI+ actually mean?
LGBTQIA+.

142
00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.880
Wait a minute:
Lesbian, gay, bi, trans.

143
00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.960
Intersex.

144
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.440
Q: Queer?
So queer.

145
00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.920
And I?
That is intersex.

146
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.160
What is intersex?

147
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.920
Intersex
is a collective term for the,

148
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.720
what deviates from the norm
a little bit deviates.

149
00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.160
Intersex
born people can,

150
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.720
if you follow the Medizin-Duden,

151
00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:35.440
does not correspond exactly to the male
or female gender

152
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.240
be assigned.

153
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:41.800
That's because,
because they have a large clitoris

154
00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.880
and small ovaries,
which are not functional.

155
00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.080
They can be due to
from physical characteristics

156
00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:52.080
or from the hormone level

157
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.880
not clearly male or female
female can be classified,

158
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.800
as far as medicine is concerned.

159
00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.440
And "plus"?

160
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:05.520
Is "plus" a placeholder for what,
what can still come?

161
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.280
Also that,
or related to it:

162
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.400
Not everyone can identify with the
letter abbreviations.

163
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:15.680
For example, non-binary people.

164
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.880
They would like to or can
from the feeling

165
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.600
not completely female
or male.

166
00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.880
They are not in the abbreviation.

167
00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.760
Or for example
the "A" for asexuality.

168
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:29.640
There are few studies on this.

169
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.240
It's also the stupid thing,
because it doesn't affect many people.

170
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:35.120
Little research is being done on this.

171
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.000
It is said that one to three percent
of society are asexual.

172
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:40.920
How they themselves experience it,

173
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.520
whether they consciously do not
have sex,

174
00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:47.320
or whether this happens unconsciously
and they have no drive,

175
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.880
is different for each person.

176
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:54.160
They can be hetero-normative,
lesbian, bi, transident

177
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.760
or non-binary, but also asexual,
because they have no desire for sex.

178
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.200
Say,
World openness and Berlin:

179
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:03.240
Is Berlin cosmopolitan?

180
00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:07.520
When you go as Jacky-Oh Wine House
go out on the street,

181
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.360
does everyone say "hooray"?

182
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.080
No.

183
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:13.880
There are many people
who think to themselves:

184
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.440
Great,
Travesty or queer people.

185
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.080
But there is still ...

186
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:22.160
No matter how colorful, open and beautiful
Berlin or Germany are ...

187
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.000
That I may live at this time
I am allowed to live in this country,

188
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.120
is a great good,
that I would never want to miss.

189
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.320
But not all people think that way.

190
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.960
Many people
do not understand the issue.

191
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.000
They have not grown up with it.
They do not have access to it.

192
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:41.120
Or what they experienced is from
strange tabloid programs:

193
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.360
Always the homosexual has
broken wrists,

194
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.040
Feather boa and latex pants.

195
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.760
I don't think that's bad.
That's great. But there is more.

196
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.120
What are they afraid of?
Actually, of nothing at all.

197
00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:56.600
People often say,
how do you say:

198
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.960
Worn, no,
beaten, no,

199
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.680
hit dogs bark.

200
00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.320
Often there is the hetero-sexist,
more familiar, homophobic echo.

201
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:10.640
It results from the fact that they
are homosexual or queer themselves.

202
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.560
They try to
to cover it up with hatred.

203
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.520
You made a video.

204
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.200
You went for a walk
walked on the street.

205
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.840
Here's what happened:

206
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.160
You're a fag.
Yes.

207
00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:24.560
You're a son of a bitch.
Yes. And still?

208
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.360
Your father too.

209
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.000
Where was that?
Which district?

210
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.960
That was on Potsdamer Platz,
in front of the Deutsche Bahn Tower.

211
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.520
To the CSD.
Four or five years ago.

212
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:42.640
What did you do
to the young man?

213
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:46.960
Nothing, I didn't
fit into the image he knows.

214
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:51.200
Then he thought he had to demonstrate
Demonstrate wide testicle behavior

215
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:52.840
and call me names.

216
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.040
In the hope,
That people cheer.

217
00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.920
I had "a sit down",
I must confess.

218
00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.320
I was seven hours
on the CSD parade.

219
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.600
There was
one or the other draught soda.

220
00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:04.640
You had poured yourself one.

221
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.680
No, I had a glass of champagne.
In the blazing sun, that works.

222
00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:12.560
It rises in the head and liver.
What is the fear?

223
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.720
What am I afraid of,

224
00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.760
if I attack you
on the street?

225
00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:22.280
That you infect me
with homosexuality?

226
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:24.200
No, with AIDS.
Immediately.

227
00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:28.080
All queer people
distribute AIDS when they exhale.

228
00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.400
No, I think,
the problem is:

229
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:34.120
Such people had little contact
with queer people.

230
00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:35.960
Or they were raised that way,

231
00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.600
that it is still read as a disgrace
or disease to be read.

232
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.080
That's why they tick off.
That's a pity.

233
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.440
You want to save others?
I cannot judge that.

234
00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.000
You'll have to ask someone
who ticks like that.

235
00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.960
I have two questions.
I'll be happy to read them to you.

236
00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.720
Please.

237
00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.760
First question: Do you think about sex
with animals?

238
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.040
Second question:
You see a meadow of flowers.

239
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:05.400
Do you have the impulse
to kick the flowers flat?

240
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.680
Do you know in which direction
the questions go?

241
00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.360
No and no.
Yes.

242
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.560
I do not want to
flatten.

243
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.840
I have no desire
for sex with animals.

244
00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.440
Do you like to have sex with animals?
No.

245
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:20.680
Do you know
where the questions come from?

246
00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:23.960
From the Internet?
No, they are real questions,

247
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:28.080
if you want to change your gender
in the identity card would like to change.

248
00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.480
Jesus.
You need to see a psychologist,

249
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.440
and are asked:
Do you like having sex with animals?

250
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.120
If you say "yes", you will not get the name changed.
not get the name changed.

251
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.080
The catalog of questions
for the change of name

252
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.360
for transgender people
is possible.

253
00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.240
This is sad and another
tragedy in society.

254
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.400
There is
the transsexual law.

255
00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:50.960
It is from the year 1981,
tender 40 years old.

256
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.400
Transgender people need to ...

257
00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.160
But also not from 1781,
but from 1981.

258
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.840
Still sucks.

259
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.200
In 1981, the
the Paragraph 175 was still current.

260
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:04.480
He was born in ...
1994.

261
00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.960
1994 on begging
changed in the direction of Helmut Kohl.

262
00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.280
That's right.
One must say to this:

263
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.800
The paragraph goes back to the
Criminal Code of the German Empire.

264
00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960
He was already a hundred at the time ...

265
00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.200
God, when did the empire exist?

266
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:24.040
1872, 73 something like that?
Come on, Kurt, you know.

267
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:26.720
I am not
busy with the emperor.

268
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.120
I was the week only
busy with you. The Empress.

269
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.560
The paragraph
from the penal code

270
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:34.240
was over a hundred years old.

271
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.880
Like lese majeste.
For example.

272
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.720
This was changed by Erdogan
and Böhmermann.

273
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.280
Everyone noticed:
We no longer have a king.

274
00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.640
How to take it.
No matter.

275
00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.880
This law still exists.

276
00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:51.160
This year there was a legislative
proposal from the Greens and the FDP.

277
00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.120
They want to
from the transsexual law ...

278
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:58.280
The term transsexual is wrong.
It should be transident.

279
00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.920
They do not want to
change their sexuality,

280
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.720
but adapt their gender
to how they feel.

281
00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.280
It is very outdated,
but still consistent.

282
00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:11.920
40 years ago, people didn't have
didn't have sex with animals either.

283
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.840
No,
but it is harassment from above.

284
00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.040
If I go and say:
Yes, I had.

285
00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:25.280
Then you must not give yourself a new
give yourself a new name. Larissa, for example.

286
00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.840
When I have had sex with animals,
I don't say: Yes, I did.

287
00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.520
It doesn't happen.
I think it's stupid.

288
00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.800
The catalog of questions also includes whether
you prefer to wear pants or skirts.

289
00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.200
All know Only men wear pants
men, women do not.

290
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.040
It is also asked:

291
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:44.480
How often people masturbate?
How often does the person have sex?

292
00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.480
Complete disaster.
Daily.

293
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:49.880
I know a neighbor,
who does this every day.

294
00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:51.720
You wear pants every day.

295
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:55.560
Yes, sometimes skirts, too.
I used to be an announcer at rbb.

296
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:57.360
Yes?
In a skirt?

297
00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.640
This is nice and airy in the summer,
depending on the underwear.

298
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:04.880
I saw last summer on Instagram
a man with a short skirt:

299
00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:07.480
I thought:
Not bad, sir.

300
00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:10.640
Fantastic.
We men always have underpants on.

301
00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.720
Then we wear shorts.
To this I must say:

302
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.360
Prefer shaved or depilated
legs and no pantyhose,

303
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.000
because pantyhose crotch sweat.
How again?

304
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.320
Pantyhose crotch sweat,

305
00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:26.480
if you wear 1000 percent
plastic pantyhose.

306
00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.640
No, I would wear a skirt.

307
00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:32.160
What was that just now?
Did you say hello to someone?

308
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.800
I am ...

309
00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.240
Pantyhose crotch sweat
is all-factor considered ...

310
00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.920
I do not wear them.

311
00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.040
I wore Perlon stockings.
Was really good, right?

312
00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.320
No,
I thought the skirt was cool.

313
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:47.720
When I was outside
smoked...

314
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.440
Wear a skirt more often.

315
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.720
Yes, I would do that.
Then go ahead.

316
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:53.960
Why not?
Should be enforced.

317
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.440
You women have it good,
you wear a skirt.

318
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.080
Why not us?

319
00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.320
We think back
back to the year 1780.

320
00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.760
There were skirts and frock coats
a common article of clothing

321
00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.880
for male read.

322
00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:08.440
Next question.
In school I learned:

323
00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:11.080
There are two genders,
men and women.

324
00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:13.880
That is a lie.
I was not finished yet.

325
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:16.320
I see.
Now I have learned the following.

326
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.920
From a biological perspective

327
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.480
you have to include a variety
of characteristics to be included,

328
00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:26.000
to be able to determine a sex
to be able to determine:

329
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:29.800
Chromosomal, genetic and
hormonal sex.

330
00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.040
Also internal and external genital.

331
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:36.240
Today, one assumes a variation
in terms of gender.

332
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:39.720
Just also an individuality,
Variety.

333
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.360
We assume many
genders than two.

334
00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:48.640
The person is absolutely right.
That was at some point ...

335
00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.920
Professor Heinz Jürgen Forst,
Sexologist.

336
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.600
That's what I wanted to say.
He made it sweet.

337
00:16:54.760 --> 00:16:56.240
Absolutely correct.

338
00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.560
There is a tendency,
before a certain age...

339
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.680
I push that a little bit
in the direction of the Christian church.

340
00:17:03.840 --> 00:17:07.760
There was a variance in genders
a part of society.

341
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.360
Likewise
a variance in sexualities.

342
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.600
Let's take a look at the indigenous
populations,

343
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.640
in North America, for example.

344
00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:19.560
They had at least
five genders at the start.

345
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.080
Persons,
who do not belong to the male

346
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.440
or female gender
were assigned,

347
00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:29.000
were healers,
People with the view upwards,

348
00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.920
People with link
to the other world.

349
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.880
Those were the ones,
with the flail in their hand.

350
00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.520
Then came the pope,
Jesus and Luther.

351
00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:40.400
The three said:
Transvestites are stupid.

352
00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:42.240
Or something like that.

353
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.640
They all wear skirts, too.
We come to Magnus Hirschfeld.

354
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.040
Magnus Hirschfeld
was a pioneer of the gay movement.

355
00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.960
I did not know:

356
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:56.520
About a hundred years ago, Berlin was
the epicenter of homosexuals.

357
00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:59.200
Absolutely right.
You always think Cologne or something.

358
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.520
It was Berlin
in the twenties.

359
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.160
It started in the Gründerzeit,
the First World War over.

360
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:09.200
Until the idiot Nazis
have flattened everything.

361
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.200
Magnus Hirschfeld has
has done pioneering work.

362
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:17.560
He has done research on gender
and sexualities

363
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.720
and published,
not only in reading form.

364
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.040
There were also songs and pictures,
and who knows what else.

365
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.040
It was a big pile of knowledge.

366
00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.120
He became, I almost wanted to say.
"with the iconoclasm",

367
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.280
but with the Reichskristallnacht
out of the way.

368
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:36.720
Not only were
Jewish synagogues were set on fire

369
00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:41.440
and people of the Jewish faith
something thrown into the stores,

370
00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.840
but everything,
what is not the Nazi,

371
00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:50.920
how do you say,
wanted to follow the Nazi shit,

372
00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.640
was extinguished and set on fire.

373
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.760
The Institute of Magnus Hirschfeld,
was, I think,

374
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:02.080
in Tiergarten, Schöneberg, Moabit,
somewhere in Berlin.

375
00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.840
The building
has survived for a relatively long time.

376
00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.040
It was bombed in the last years of the war.
bombed.

377
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.000
All the knowledge that was in there
went down the drain.

378
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.120
If the knowledge of the lovely
gentleman would be handed down,

379
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.480
society would be
not only in Germany,

380
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.120
but a lot further worldwide.

381
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.760
The Nazis have once again
done a great job.

382
00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:30.920
That the Nazi era was not a nice time
for queer people is clear.

383
00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.960
What was gay life like
after the Second World War?

384
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.920
The gay life
was not much nicer than before.

385
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.760
The homos,
who were interned in the concentration camp

386
00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:46.040
or luckily survived,

387
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.960
were continued under Adenauer
continued to be pursued.

388
00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.600
It wasn't:
"Nazis gone, hurray gays".

389
00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:53.920
No, they were
collected further.

390
00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.320
It was a criminal offense,
Paragraph 175.

391
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.480
Section 175 until 1994.

392
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:01.200
Europe-wide it was already through.

393
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.120
Kohl was the last to say:
No, we won't do that.

394
00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.960
But then in 1994 it did.

395
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:13.560
I'm messing up the whole floor.
Everything is already messed up.

396
00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.440
Do you have a feudel?
Feudel?

397
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.280
Yes, to feud through later.

398
00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.440
Ingrid, do you have a feudel?
Yes.

399
00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:22.240
Ingrid, I'm sorry.
Do not talk to her,

400
00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:25.520
otherwise it becomes conceited.
Sorry.

401
00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:32.400
2017 saw a milestone:
Marriage for all was introduced.

402
00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.000
Hangs now a poster
of Angela Merkel

403
00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:37.280
above the bed at your place?
No, at your place?

404
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:40.280
Can you do my nails now
do my nails now, please, honey?

405
00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.960
Yes, dad.

406
00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.000
You got that from our show.
Were you at Berghain?

407
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.040
I bought that one.
You were in Berghain

408
00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.800
and have stickers
from cell phone cameras on it.

409
00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:54.600
Is that so there?
Yes.

410
00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.800
I've never been in there.

411
00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:59.680
Can I get in there?
Or do they say: No, gone.

412
00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.840
I think
you can get in there.

413
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.920
Because of celebrities?
Yes.

414
00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:06.240
Or do they say:
This is a horny guy.

415
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.280
Probably not,
that's the celebrity.

416
00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:13.280
I need something to put underneath,
that the hands are relaxed.

417
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:17.160
Can we use the phone?
We had a towel snail.

418
00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:20.040
It's all taped.
It is taped.

419
00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.520
Can we ask Ingrid?

420
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:27.240
So, that is called nail snail?
Hello snail.

421
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:30.600
Towel snail,
go for it.

422
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.800
I had a performance with Moritz Neumeier
a performance.

423
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:36.280
He always does
always does his fingernails.

424
00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.360
For the sake of his child?
Hashtag "paint me yet".

425
00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:41.560
We were together backstage.

426
00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:44.040
I said:
Give me your nail polish.

427
00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.520
I'll put it on myself, too.
Then we are in the partner look.

428
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.960
The show was over. I still had it
it the next day.

429
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.720
I found it beautiful
and did not want to take it off.

430
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.680
Then I noticed
how people look.

431
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.800
I don't know that at all.
Yes, but only with nail polish.

432
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.240
I thought: If I still have a skirt on
skirt, what's going on?

433
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.480
This can happen to you
on the subway.

434
00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.080
Especially that people ask:
Are you gay?

435
00:22:12.240 --> 00:22:13.920
Because I have nail polish on it.

436
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.920
Nail color is a sign
of faulty sexuality.

437
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.120
In the subway a woman
looked and smiled.

438
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.520
The wrote half an hour later
on Instagram:

439
00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.280
I didn't dare ask:
What kind of brand is this?

440
00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:32.000
Or when I bought cigarettes
and gave away the money,

441
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.240
the salesman wrinkled his nose,
like "fie devil".

442
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:39.720
All this is completely unknown to me,
never happens to me.

443
00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:42.040
I don't know,
whether I am allowed to say that:

444
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.560
I could put myself
put myself in your place.

445
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.640
I thought, if I with nail polish
I'm already looked at so,

446
00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:53.720
then we are not there yet,
as far as tolerance is concerned.

447
00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.400
There you see,

448
00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.080
how gauntlet-like
the lives of queer people are,

449
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.120
that visually
do not follow the mainstream.

450
00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:05.600
You get to hear
something to hear.

451
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.040
The video we saw
was at Potsdamer Platz.

452
00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:12.760
There were mountains of people standing there,
and no one opened their mouths.

453
00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.280
I thought: There are tourists,
and it's international.

454
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.320
It's not so noticeable there.
Shit is everywhere.

455
00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:23.040
Regardless of district, place of residence,
house number or street.

456
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.160
What is it?
You have spilled.

457
00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:26.880
I have done nothing.

458
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:30.240
How am I supposed to use my brush ...
This looks like pig.

459
00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:32.600
Anyway.
It stretches your fat fingers.

460
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.600
I don't have fat fingers.
You have fat fingers.

461
00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:39.040
Did you say I have fat
I have fat fingers? We have that on tape.

462
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.840
Yes.
Greasy sausage fingers?

463
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.760
They are not filigree.
They are beautiful fingers.

464
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.600
Yes, they are beautiful.
You see.

465
00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.480
They are chewed off.
Look at me.

466
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:54.400
I was nervous earlier.
Are you nibbling? No.

467
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.840
When Olaf Scholz, Big Scholz
becomes or is German Chancellor ...

468
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.560
I don't know,
when this will be broadcast,

469
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.320
maybe we had
new elections again ...

470
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:06.920
I drink it all up.
This is my soda.

471
00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.440
Shall I pour you a drink?
Go ahead and drink. No.

472
00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.960
Will everything be better
with the queer community?

473
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.320
Is Scholz someone
who stands up and says: Come.

474
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.840
The SPD has in recent times,
one does not know why,

475
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:27.000
possibly because she really thinks
that the future is queer,

476
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:31.520
or because she had
for votes from the electorate,

477
00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:35.240
she has done more
for queer people.

478
00:24:35.400 --> 00:24:38.640
What the background is,
hard to say.

479
00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:42.640
Can you hang up, I can
get a call at any time.

480
00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:45.480
With the cable in any case,
my dear.

481
00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.440
Maybrit.
Why don't you call me May?

482
00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:51.160
Mayi or Illy.

483
00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:55.160
I believe it is
a big step forward,

484
00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.920
when at the head of state

485
00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.720
no longer such a Christian
oriented Union brat ...

486
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:03.360
You can say that.
Much worse is,

487
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:06.880
on television,
that I have greasy sausage fingers.

488
00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.960
That's worse,
than calling someone a brat.

489
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:13.280
When someone
is at the head of state

490
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:16.680
and more open,
free and unconstrained

491
00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:21.440
and with less scruples in the head
about queer life,

492
00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:24.600
that is advantageous,
in any case.

493
00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.520
The most important question of the evening.
I am 18.

494
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.280
Yes?
Yes.

495
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:32.560
I thought you were younger.
You look younger.

496
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.560
The most important question: When do
that it is dry?

497
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:39.320
So, it depends.

498
00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:42.040
It's completely overpainted,
I can do better.

499
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.960
Do you know why? Your sausage fingers
swell out from under the nail.

500
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:50.520
Show again the picture
of Wowereit and me in 2008.

501
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.680
I was 18 then.

502
00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:56.800
Stop laughing. Can we
cut out the laughter.

503
00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:58.800
Fortunately, you have grown older.

504
00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.760
I am the one on the left.

505
00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:03.960
You look like shit there.
Why? I was young.

506
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:07.240
I used to have a little
crush on you.

507
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.320
How? When?
Three, four, five years ago.

508
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.520
I was over 40 then.
So what?

509
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.640
I thought at the time.
No.

510
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.400
The glasses, but the rest,
my love.

511
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.040
But you know,
I haven't had to tint yet.

512
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:23.520
Now I have to tint.
But I can see the gray hairs.

513
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.880
I do not sound like a
pop singer from the 70s.

514
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.800
I tone so that you can see
the gray hair shows through.

515
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.640
Guildo?
Guildo was great.

516
00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.760
Grayish hair is sexy.
You can leave it.

517
00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.520
There is a hole in the back,
I'll have it sprayed shut.

518
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.800
There you can write with sharpie
on it: Wine house is great.

519
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:45.040
I ask the make-up artist
if she can plug the hole for me.

520
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:48.520
Next time you leave blank,
I have a sharpie with me.

521
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:50.920
We are at the end.

522
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.800
It's closing time.
Unfortunately, we have to stop.

523
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.560
Bye.

524
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.240
We're still going out:
Press conference.

525
00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.760
Did you enjoy it?
That's a prerequisite, of course.

526
00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.000
Everyone has fun,
who is here.

527
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.960
Do you have the feeling
we've got it all under control?

528
00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:11.880
No.
It is too little.

529
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:14.840
We make a four-part
next time?

530
00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:16.560
With many possibilities,

531
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.640
to talk about everything
what queer life has to offer.

532
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:23.160
We need more airtime,
30 minutes is not enough.

533
00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.120
We'll call it a day,
then we'll go back in.

534
00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:29.280
You light a cigarette
and blow in my face.

535
00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.560
Gladly.
May I say goodbye?

536
00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:35.920
Dear participants, ladies,
Gentlemen and inclusive genders.

537
00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.480
My name is Jack-Oh Wine House.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart,

538
00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.080
that you found time
to experience Chez Krömer.

539
00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:45.200
I'll have another smoke.
Take care, neighbors. Bye.

540
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:47.680
Is it that way?

541
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:50.480
Stand still,
we are not at the end yet.

542
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.920
