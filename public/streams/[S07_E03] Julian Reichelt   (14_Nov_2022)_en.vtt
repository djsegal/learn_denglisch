00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.240
.

2
00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.480
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.800
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.400
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.760
Let's see what the cat
has put in front of the door today:

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:26.560
Julian Reichelt, 42 years old,
2017-2021 "Bild"-Chefredakteur,

7
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.400
once said in an interview:
"Mendacity disgusts me."

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.040
So, first of all a quartz.

9
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.560
Good evening.
Good evening, Mr. Reichelt.

10
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.640
Thank you for the invitation.
Please, please.

11
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.000
You are also a heavy smoker, aren't you?
Yes.

12
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.720
Smoked more back then,
when these compliance procedures

13
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.640
have been initiated against you?

14
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.480
No, there were other situations
in my life,

15
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.880
in which I
smoked much more.

16
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.760
In war zones, it was ...

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.000
I never really had the situation
to quit smoking,

18
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.360
but I think in the 10 years
in war zones it was the most.

19
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.480
Her parents met as journalists
journalists at the "Bild" newspaper.

20
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.880
Today both publish
mainly about alternative medicine,

21
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.040
operate several portals
on the subject of homeopathy

22
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.080
and published
books on the subject as well. - True.

23
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.560
But it is not quite true.
Bild newspaper and homeopathy.

24
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.200
It's not quite true.

25
00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.160
This is relatively
outdated Wikipedia information.

26
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.360
I just wanted to finish.
Bild newspaper and homeopathy,

27
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.480
to spread unproven bullshit,
so it runs in the family.

28
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.600
There is about homeopathy the sentence:
"He who heals is right."

29
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.600
This is a highly controversial topic,
but...

30
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:57.440
Are you into homeopathy?
I grew up with homeopathy.

31
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.480
So you had to like it.

32
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.960
It worked for me, but there are many
there are many possible explanations.

33
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.720
What helped?
Homeopathic remedies.

34
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.840
Against what now?
What did you have?

35
00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.320
What you have:
Cold, mumps, scarlet fever.

36
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.200
My father says:
Homeopathy works,

37
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.720
but you have to take a lot of it.
I see.

38
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.480
Under you as editor-in-chief
Bild" became significantly more radical

39
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.960
and slid to the right.
This, of course, pleased the AfD.

40
00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.480
There was a culture of welcome
also in the Bild newspaper

41
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.800
and then the
the editor-in-chief was changed.

42
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.480
I think even twice,
because the readers

43
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.040
did not want this welcoming culture
wanted to have and did not participate.

44
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.400
Are you glad you got rid of this stupid
welcome culture away?

45
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.800
That's another cliché.

46
00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.760
I was, and I would
in parts as a mistake,

47
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.640
Part of the welcome culture.

48
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.840
Welcome culture in the media
is what you might call it.

49
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.560
That was because as a reporter I experienced
I spent several years in Syria,

50
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.520
how there was bombed.

51
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.360
I always said that if we
don't help them there at home,

52
00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.720
there will be, first, radicalization
and secondly, flight.

53
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.120
Is there escape,
after we watched,

54
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.240
how their children are gassed ...

55
00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.000
After Germany
vowed "never again",

56
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.440
gassed Assad
Syrian children with sarin,

57
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.560
which was developed as an alternative
developed as an alternative to Zyklon B

58
00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.880
From German scientists.
German politics said:

59
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.120
Bitter, but we can
nothing we can do.

60
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.320
I always said:
We have to help,

61
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.840
that is the oath,
our raison d'état.

62
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.640
If we don't, we have to give them
provide them with protection. - How to help?

63
00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.240
That they can't get in
not get in?

64
00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.160
You've been following that wrong.

65
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.080
I said,
we must intervene in Syria.

66
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.800
No-fly zone against
precisely the Russian bombardment,

67
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.760
what we are experiencing again right now.

68
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.680
If we do not,
we have to take in Syrians.

69
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.560
That has always been my position.

70
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.600
I did not mean
everyone who says: I am Syrian.

71
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.160
But that's how it came across.
Nah, nah.

72
00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:10.040
Mr. Gauland has got it
got it all wrong?

73
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.240
How Mr. Gauland understands things,

74
00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.800
Mr. Gauland is
responsible.

75
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.640
So you have the AfD
not served a little

76
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.600
with saucy sayings?
No, on the contrary,

77
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.960
that has also changed
changed in a funny way.

78
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.880
I was once criticized a lot for that.
It wasn't that funny.

79
00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.800
Then we call it
transformed in a cynical way.

80
00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.320
I was once extremely
criticized for saying:

81
00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.520
We have made a name for ourselves through
our positioning with "Bild

82
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.000
in the refugee crisis, namely
Syrians in Germany,

83
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.240
because that is our moral duty
lost a great many readers.

84
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.880
I am proud of that.

85
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.880
Interestingly
the media left the sentence:

86
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.280
"I'm proud of that"
always gone.

87
00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.080
But what is true,
that must be said:

88
00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.440
I could not imagine
how bad the management

89
00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:05.080
the catastrophic situation
would be politically,

90
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.760
that we do not, for example
not deport criminals.

91
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.000
Could I have imagined that,

92
00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.400
I might be the situation,
to take in people on that scale,

93
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.400
been more critical of it.

94
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.400
I was always in favor of helping people
from Syria.

95
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.320
Their new line was worthwhile, not
at the circulation ... - In what way?

96
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.120
... but with the reprimands
from the Press Council. Respect.

97
00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:29.560
It went steeply upwards,
as far as the reprimands were concerned. - Was it?

98
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.280
I think it's always ...
We have a graphic. - ... stable.

99
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.760
That always went up.
But you know, the Press Council ...

100
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.640
At the top was the compliance
procedure, then it went downhill.

101
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.520
I can tell you
perhaps tell you one thing,

102
00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.960
because you just mentioned Syria.

103
00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.600
I have not,
we're on "press lies" now.

104
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.920
This must be said
to say to the "Press Council".

105
00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.760
The Rügen we have here ...

106
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.360
We were reprimanded, for example,
that we had children,

107
00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.840
who were gassed in Ghuta, in Damascus.
have shown unpixelated,

108
00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.120
to demonstrate
what happened there.

109
00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:10.320
Unfortunately, the Press Council has become
such a politicized instrument,

110
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.720
that this "Rügen-Policiy"
cannot be taken seriously.

111
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.320
But there were justified reprimands.
Exactly, that's what we're getting to now.

112
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.960
"Rügen" sounds harmless,
but they are often blatant stories.

113
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.440
They were reprimanded, for example,
for printing spree killers without pixels.

114
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.720
Research shows that this is
that this is precisely what provokes new attacks.

115
00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.720
There are clear studies on
on the topics of "amok" and "attacks".

116
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.280
There it is unambiguous and clear,
that the worst,

117
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.280
what media can do is, if
they can show the perpetrator with his face

118
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.160
on front pages or home pages of
of homepages.

119
00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:51.520
Then it is clear
that this animates future perpetrators.

120
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.400
At this point, my impression is
that the Bild-Zeitung is trying

121
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.040
these boundaries
to shift little by little,

122
00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.680
at the cost
of new attacks

123
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.520
and radicalization processes
in society.

124
00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:08.320
That "the" science
does not always agree,

125
00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:10.440
we experienced the last 2 years.

126
00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.520
This is the view of a gentleman,

127
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.400
who may have conducted studies
has carried out.

128
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.120
The former chairman
"Bund Deutscher Kriminalbeamter".

129
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.520
But it is a view,
one must not confuse the two.

130
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:26.840
Science also said that
vaccination protects against infections.

131
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.480
We'll get to that.

132
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.120
We know today that
the view of a single person,

133
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.520
which in this case
for nonsense ...

134
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:37.440
You are of the opinion,
that the unpixelated ...

135
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.800
Should Andreas Baader be pixilated?

136
00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.960
He's dead,
You can leave him unpixelated.

137
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.800
Would you have pixelated him when he was a
terrorist? Or Mohammed Atta?

138
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:49.240
Atta radicalizes
people to this day.

139
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:52.040
Would you pixelate him?
That is not the question.

140
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.920
Yes, they are terrorists,
who contribute to radicalization.

141
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:58.400
Mr. Reichelt,
I am asking the questions.

142
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.520
Shall we pixelate you
or how do we remain,

143
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.360
that no one is provoked,
to imitate it.

144
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.160
I am for: "show what is"
- like to show me unpixelated.

145
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.280
I am interested in your answer.
Would you pixelate Mohammed Atta?

146
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.520
I ask the questions.
Good. - Or the next reprimand.

147
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.120
Or the rebuke
to the child murder in Solingen?

148
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.240
There is said to be a mother
killed 5 of her children.

149
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:25.880
A 6th sibling,
11 years, survives

150
00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.040
and you print chat messages,
that he sent to his friends.

151
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:31.680
Yes, that was a mistake.

152
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.840
Is the "Bild" not
against child abuse?

153
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.280
That was a mistake that
we made editorially in the situation

154
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.480
have misjudged.
There were reasons for that.

155
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:46.720
Were you alone in the editorial office?
There are always 20 people there.

156
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.400
Yes, but much does not
not from misjudgement.

157
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.360
That was a mistake,
which was based, among other things, on this,

158
00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:56.400
that these chats
were already published.

159
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:59.600
Because others have done it,
so have you.

160
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.560
No, but this flows
into an assessment.

161
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:05.920
That remains a mistake
and in this case it was my mistake.

162
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.760
But brings quota, 'ne?
No.

163
00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:13.000
Who else was reprimanded for the same
facts? Süddeutsche Zeitung.

164
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.440
Why?
Because she did the same thing.

165
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.640
But she is not a guest today.
I know. -Julian Reichelt is a guest.

166
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:23.320
You see, some mistakes
are not ideologically driven.

167
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:26.120
These things happen.
For others, it was a mistake.

168
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.160
I now read Süddeutsche every day
and do everything they do.

169
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.280
In the case of errors, I say:
The Süddeutsche also has ...

170
00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.520
I just said that
is perhaps evidence of that,

171
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.760
that other editorial offices
came to similar conclusions

172
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.720
and therefore made a mistake.
We have only half an hour.

173
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.360
There were 2 reprimands
in the dramatic case of Kasia Lenhardt.

174
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:51.360
The separation war between Jerome Boateng
between Jerome Boateng and

175
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.200
and Lenhardt first took place
and decisively in the "Bild".

176
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.880
They even printed
Lenhardt's most private messages.

177
00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:02.640
In the end ... - That's not true.
... she committed suicide.

178
00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:06.000
These messages
had been published

179
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.840
from the participants
in the social media.

180
00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.720
For the media, this is
a decisive hurdle.

181
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.320
Do people
something publicly themselves?

182
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.520
But you printed it?
Or do you procure something?

183
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:20.800
Things that are public,
to publish,

184
00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.920
is different from publishing non-public
things to be published.

185
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:28.560
It was in there, too,
where you got that?

186
00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.960
That was on Instagram,
if I remember correctly.

187
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.640
The whole chat history?
Yes, that was published there.

188
00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.920
The woman's dead now, huh?
What do you say?

189
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:46.280
I find it a very sad,
distressing, bitter story.

190
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.520
Could you not have
not been able to think about it

191
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.640
and that times
can not publish?

192
00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.200
You know, the problem,
that you often face...

193
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.640
Who has more reach?
The Insta page or "Bild"?

194
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.280
Instagram has significantly more
reach? - All of Instagram.

195
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:07.600
But not the page,
from which you have the chat history.

196
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:10.920
It doesn't get us anywhere,
with such ethical questions

197
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.320
Reach comparisons to be made.
Instagram has more reach.

198
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:17.960
But we are talking
about the suicide of the woman.

199
00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.560
Exactly, that's right,
we only know both...

200
00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.480
They insinuate
a clear motive

201
00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.600
for this terrible decision.
Unfortunately, this is not true.

202
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.960
I would have thought earlier
whether I would have published this in the "Bild",

203
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.000
which is not only read by 3 people
is spread out boldly once again.

204
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:39.080
They say the motive
for this shocking decision

205
00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:43.320
was reporting.
And that is simply not true.

206
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.280
Their biggest defeat was the
campaign against Christian Drosten.

207
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.200
Even Friede Springer
is said to have intervened.

208
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:54.480
The was so pissed and refused
you even the handshake.

209
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.480
Yes, handshake is not true.

210
00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.360
Nah, so true the whole ...
Didn't she want to give the foot once?

211
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:04.840
No, this communication
always took place on the phone.

212
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:09.640
The dispute was
not about Christian Drosten

213
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.400
with Friede Springer.

214
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:17.360
The dispute was over the
Corona coverage as a whole,

215
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:24.680
where Friede Springer
had the idea

216
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.280
and to me
made very clear,

217
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.120
that "Bild" in the beginning
Corona crisis, at the very beginning,

218
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.920
from now on supporting
for the government and the chancellor

219
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.560
should report.

220
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.440
That was not my concept
of journalism.

221
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.760
They cited an unfinished study
and scientists,

222
00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:44.880
who want
want nothing to do with it.

223
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.920
No, we quoted
from an incorrect study.

224
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.880
In this study, it came out,

225
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:54.200
that children are probably
more contagious than adults.

226
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.800
This study was the basis for it,
Children over months ...

227
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.640
By the way, I am
very proud of the story.

228
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.640
On the wrong story? - No,
not a single comma was wrong.

229
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.160
No, wrong study.
Then the story is also wrong.

230
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.160
No, the story
was about the wrong study.

231
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.160
The story was ...
I get a headache.

232
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:17.200
that Christian Drosten's
study,

233
00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:21.120
that children are probably
more contagious than adults.

234
00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.440
That was the basis for the policy,
To close schools

235
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:26.760
and children away for months.

236
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.960
Then scientists were quoted,
who ... - No.

237
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:34.400
We had correct information,
that the study was miscalculated

238
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.600
and the opposite came out.

239
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.640
With this we confronted the
Christian Drosten statistician.

240
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.440
It does not become clearer
if you repeat it.

241
00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.320
Let me finish.
They always tell the same story.

242
00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.720
He confirmed this and
said, "We miscalculated."

243
00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:52.440
That was our story.

244
00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.800
After the outcry, you reported
more cautiously about Drosten.

245
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.040
Were they then
canceled by Friede Springer?

246
00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.400
Not in the case of Christian Drosten.

247
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.600
But I find it
as symptomatic

248
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.600
for the whole Corona crisis,

249
00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:11.200
- that is, I think,
very German -

250
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:14.160
that in crises and
great uncertainties

251
00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.360
this narrative
Salvationist Christian Drosten

252
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.320
and scapegoat Reichelt,
"He only gave him 1 hour",

253
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.960
is built up.

254
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.360
I believe,
today we know a lot ...

255
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.360
Did Mr. Drosten
misbehaved with you, or what?

256
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:33.400
Christian Drosten could have, for example
been able to respond to our inquiry,

257
00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.240
as the Charite always did,

258
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.640
instead of publishing the number of our
reporter's number,

259
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:42.880
who was subjected to savage, in part anti-Semitic
and in some cases anti-Semitic insults.

260
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:46.640
He then took from the side
down again. - By then it was too late.

261
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:52.360
But they were always
not so rowdy on it.

262
00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.640
In "Tier-Bild" you succeeded with the column
the column "Reichelt streichelt".

263
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.160
A column about her dog, who
especially liked to eat pasta with scampi.

264
00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.280
Yes, oh yes.

265
00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.480
Sweet.
I have to hand it to you,

266
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.080
You are the first
who comes to this column.

267
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.000
Because it's so sweet.
We wanted something sweet, too.

268
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:15.840
Animals always go. - Dogs
always work and old people.

269
00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.080
Stroking was also your thing later:

270
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.560
An affair
with a trainee,

271
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:24.680
who later promoted her to a management
position in the newsroom.

272
00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.600
Pure talent, I suppose.

273
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:29.560
This has been
reported very extensively.

274
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.000
I said that
before this program, too.

275
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:38.440
I consider this whole,
abominable and repulsive

276
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.320
and slanderous
Reporting

277
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:48.520
as part of a campaign that took over
seized my private life.

278
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:52.640
Incidentally, this is exactly what
these people like to accuse "Bild" of.

279
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:56.280
Therefore, I say nothing about it,
because it is my private life.

280
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.960
I can only tell you that ...
But there are so many questions. - Yes.

281
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.440
But we don't want anything
from your private life, which ...

282
00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:10.200
It is my private life, which is
core, even in a partly bitter way,

283
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:14.520
my family and all the people
to whom I am dear

284
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.400
and who are dear to me,
fortunately there are still some of them,

285
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.040
has met.

286
00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:23.720
I'm just not going to say anything more about that,
because the way,

287
00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.600
with which this was done,
was repulsive.

288
00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.680
Answer the next question,
then it's good.

289
00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:33.960
You got a friend
a permanent contract from "Bild

290
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.040
and showed her
to continue the relationship,

291
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.560
a forged divorce certificate.
No. - Also a lie?

292
00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.200
These are exactly the things,

293
00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:46.240
that I no longer talk about,
because they touch on my private life.

294
00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.960
The way you read it out ...

295
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.280
But you got the woman
a job at the "Bild"?

296
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.920
No, that is also wrong.

297
00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.680
I know, it was in the mirror
and has since solidified.

298
00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:02.720
Bitter enough that
to work with this methodology.

299
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:04.600
I hold it for all of us ...

300
00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.640
Greasy methods, huh?
Yes, indeed.

301
00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.600
Pig journalism, too?
Yes, too.

302
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.200
I can say to this,
that with "Bild" ...

303
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:16.400
That they are allowed to work like this,
these journalists, huh?

304
00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.440
... made sure that we talked about
privacy and intimacy of people

305
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.360
no longer report,
if they do not agree.

306
00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:27.480
I do not want to judge
about how people behave in private.

307
00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:31.520
After you have been in the public
stood? - No, 4 years before.

308
00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.880
Do you use drugs? - No.
Coke? - No.

309
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:40.280
You affirmed in 2021
to Springer in lieu of an oath,

310
00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:42.960
that you do not use drugs.
Yes. - Correct?

311
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:46.280
Yes, I did,
I don't remember the details.

312
00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.000
The drugs you were taking?

313
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.480
The compliance process
was an inconceivable collapse

314
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:54.880
into my private and intimate sphere.

315
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:58.720
I think such questions
you better ask other guests,

316
00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.760
Stuckrad-Barre or something.
You didn't take drugs?

317
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:05.640
As I said, I do not talk
about my private and intimate sphere,

318
00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:08.640
and believe the topic
is with friends of the show

319
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.200
like Stuckrad-Barre
would be better off.

320
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.720
Because we heard from
something different from one of the people concerned. - Yes.

321
00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.360
I work in a professional environment
from Julian Reichelt

322
00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:22.240
and can confirm that
Julian Reichelt uses cocaine

323
00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:24.800
and consumed
in the past.

324
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:29.760
I remember one evening,
when he drew 5-7 lines.

325
00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.040
I can't imagine,

326
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.800
that the next day
was already sober.

327
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:36.920
Right.

328
00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.560
What should I ...?
Former employee of the "Bild" newspaper.

329
00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.560
Anonymized dirt.

330
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.840
How?
What should I say?

331
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.320
I came here to...
We had this checked out legally.

332
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.400
The woman worked among them at
"Bild." - I do not deny that.

333
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.720
During the recording
3 witnesses were present.

334
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.360
I believe everything you say.

335
00:18:56.520 --> 00:19:00.160
But even then,
You talk about my private life

336
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.560
and I am no longer ready ...

337
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.920
You declared publicly on
in lieu of an oath that you do not take drugs.

338
00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.680
Then you must answer,
when something like this comes.

339
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.960
They use methods,
that correspond to the space here.

340
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.320
That's what it's there for.
Yes, yes, but as I said ...

341
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.520
Here's the thing,

342
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.280
when you say my depression
are my private life,

343
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:29.160
I also do not talk about
your depressions and transgressions,

344
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.160
that come with it,
because I respect that.

345
00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.960
I wrote a book about it

346
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.960
and can say no more,
I do not talk about it.

347
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:41.080
I still wouldn't, it's your
private life. - Silly in that case.

348
00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.120
You should respect that ...

349
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.160
The "Bild" wanted
to be the first to have a preprint.

350
00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.600
... instead of throwing
instead of throwing dirt around.

351
00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:52.240
You had a thing with a lot of women from the
Springer universe.

352
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:54.840
Mr. Krömer,
I will tell you once again,

353
00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.080
otherwise we would have to end this.

354
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.280
I do not want to
talk about my private life. - Yes.

355
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:03.480
I want to talk about accusations.
But the accusations ...

356
00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:08.040
You are said to have had an erotic
erotic relationship,

357
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:11.600
over which you, as editor-in-chief
also had power.

358
00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:13.800
Mr. Krömer, I'll say it again.

359
00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:17.720
You make yourself,
like Mr. Küppersbusch,

360
00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:25.600
who played a major role in this,
into an attack machine.

361
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.440
What does Mr. Küppersbusch have
to do with it? - He has also participated in ...

362
00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.240
This is a funny detail,
that his company is called "Pro Bono",

363
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.960
although he pockets millions
public broadcasting funds.

364
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:41.160
But that's not the point. - Let's
Let's talk about abuse of power.

365
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.440
We don't need to talk about that.
But was a clear ...

366
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.040
These allegations have, after all, been cleared up.

367
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.040
I'll tell you again,
this is my privacy.

368
00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.240
You are doing something here that is
is unfair. I resent that.

369
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.360
If you continue to do this, I
no longer participate in it.

370
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.360
What you are doing,
is a form of ...

371
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:10.000
That is exactly what you
actually find so repulsive,

372
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.640
on people who ...

373
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:14.600
Well, Mr. Reichelt,
give me a break,

374
00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:16.840
portray themselves as victims here.

375
00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.160
I do not present myself as a victim.

376
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.040
Everyone else is to blame ...

377
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:24.920
Here are 6 women. - I only represent
you only as what you are.

378
00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.320
But that's what happened,
why isn't it talked about?

379
00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:31.760
No, that's what it says
in your little Stasi file,

380
00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.480
that is, not that it happened.
Who wrote this, Secret Santa?

381
00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.440
Did someone break into my house
and falsified everything?

382
00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.800
They use methods
that you find repulsive.

383
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.640
That makes you
and your methods repulsive.

384
00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.680
I find it repulsive
when I'm with my children

385
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:52.480
being shot down by paparazzi.
I have never done that.

386
00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:56.480
When I take drugs on Ku'damm,
which newspaper in Germany

387
00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:59.360
is the first to report on it?
I do not know.

388
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.800
I didn't do that, did I?

389
00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.560
Or was it me?
Then tell me.

390
00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.040
We have a statement of claim here.
Yes.

391
00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.440
Then a woman in the USA, who worked for
worked under you at "Bild,

392
00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.240
Lawsuit filed against "Bild
and Springer. - Yes.

393
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.920
It says here 15 times,
that she saw herself as a victim.

394
00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:25.240
This is an ongoing process,
to which I can only say,

395
00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.880
that the accusations made therein
are complete lies and fabrications.

396
00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:35.560
You make yourself a willing full
strecker in a very disgusting way.

397
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.760
From whom?
Who is the employer?

398
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:41.000
Who is the one who ...
This procedure.

399
00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.400
I do not know
why you are doing this.

400
00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.520
I asked myself that often
in the last 12 months,

401
00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.360
why civilized people,
who have weaknesses, like you,

402
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:56.400
who suffer from things
so unthinkingly

403
00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.120
and with this furor
to the executor ...

404
00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.200
I suffer from it,
when men exercise their power

405
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.680
and relationships
with women ...

406
00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:08.360
Is this something you personally suffer from?
I find it repulsive.

407
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:12.640
What? - I find it repulsive,
that the accusation is in the room ...

408
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:15.720
But you can
not find reproaches repulsive.

409
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:19.280
Mr. Krömer, the country in which
we live in is not a country after all,

410
00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:22.880
in which you appear in a publicly
legally financed show

411
00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.480
any accusations
find repulsive,

412
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.280
but in which things
can be asserted.

413
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.000
Here is a woman who describes
herself in this statement of claim

414
00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.320
15 times as a victim, 15 times.
She lies.

415
00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.360
And it's not about
what anyone says,

416
00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:40.760
but about
what can be proven

417
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.360
and not that you will find any
accusations - whatsoever - to find.

418
00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.760
Why did you get
out of the "Bild"?

419
00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.640
I don't know until today.

420
00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.520
You don't know? - No,
I was never told that clearly.

421
00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:55.440
Because of the great success?

422
00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:58.200
I have also
already said more often.

423
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.520
The justifications,
given publicly,

424
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.560
I have already said this several times,
are not correct.

425
00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:08.200
I felt that this was part
of a massive campaign.

426
00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.000
From the "Bild" as well?

427
00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.600
No, but within Axel Springer
it was already a mob,

428
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.280
who partly went for me.

429
00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:18.520
Because several women
complained about you. - No.

430
00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:21.760
Your former boss,
Mathias Döpfner, said about you:

431
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.160
"He is the last and
only journalist in Germany,

432
00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.240
who still courageously rebels against the new
GDR authoritarian state."

433
00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:32.560
Only to then dismiss them
because they lied.

434
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:35.600
How personally disappointed
are you with M. Döpfner?

435
00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:37.320
Already disappointed.

436
00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:41.200
Was it?

437
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:46.000
Such situations always leave
always leave disappointments.

438
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:49.520
Mathias Döpfner and I
worked closely together.

439
00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:52.640
I assume that he is
disappointed in me, too.

440
00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:54.520
That is clear.
Looks like this

441
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.200
When you have been so close for so long
and agreed on so many things

442
00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.880
and lived in the perception
to stand up for certain things

443
00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:05.000
and it comes apart like this,
you are very disappointed,

444
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.640
but not bitter.

445
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:09.800
Quick question:
Did you plug the "Financial Times",

446
00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.000
that Döpfner is the landlord
of Adidas? - No.

447
00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.640
You weren't?
Nope.

448
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:19.000
After all, it was a big story,
that many people knew.

449
00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:20.760
I don't know who that was.

450
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:23.400
You didn't get any of that either?
Of what?

451
00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.920
Did he not approach you:
"Report on that sometime, ... - Yes, he did.

452
00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.400
... Adidas pays the rent
not because of Corona."

453
00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.000
That's what it says
in the Financial Times.

454
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.240
This was confirmed by Axel Springer
confirmed how that was.

455
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:39.720
With your new YouTube format
"Attention, Reichelt!"

456
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.560
you have already
gained many new friends

457
00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.240
and your topic
you have also found.

458
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.120
We stand before
the economic super-GAU.

459
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.760
Acrid hunger,
Chaos, popular uprisings.

460
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.400
No job in Germany
is secure for years to come.

461
00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:59.840
The super-GAU of the blackout.
It will end in chaos.

462
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.200
You, all of us, your children,
will freeze in the winter.

463
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.120
Electricity will be the new caviar.

464
00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:09.680
Wiping out your family as well,
total collapse, energy disaster,

465
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.200
epochal and
unforgivable madness

466
00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.120
with the cruel constraint
of a cold, dark winter.

467
00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:20.960
Was that a whole episode
or was it cut?

468
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.720
I think your editorial team
helped out a bit.

469
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.520
Slightly tendentious.

470
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.840
For the format you recruited
Several well paid employees

471
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.640
from the "Bild".
Hhm.

472
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.160
But now we saw,
You're not monetizing this at all.

473
00:26:37.320 --> 00:26:40.440
Right, it's all about
first of all only about range building

474
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.640
and then about monetization.

475
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:46.160
How do people get paid?
From money.

476
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.640
Who gives the money?
This is confidential.

477
00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.240
There has been a lot of reporting on this.

478
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.960
Do you play the lottery?
I also play the lottery.

479
00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.600
House flea market?

480
00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.280
My highest win
was 3 correct numbers.

481
00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.880
There's about 20 employees there.
Hm.

482
00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.680
Once a month
Santa Claus comes?

483
00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.800
Once a month they get salary,
and that is private-economy,

484
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:11.720
not public law.

485
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.560
No one is forced to pay for
"Attention, Reichelt!

486
00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:17.240
and watch it.

487
00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:21.480
I have an idea for you,
how you can call the name.

488
00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:25.440
Namely? - We researched,
that the landlord of your studio

489
00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:27.080
Billionaire is.

490
00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.560
Mr. Gotthard,
who also has two local stations.

491
00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.720
Can you not say to that:
Let me off the rent?

492
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.760
Maybe I'll give that a try.

493
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:40.680
Can he give you
give you a hand?

494
00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:44.640
My limited experience in living
with billionaires is,

495
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:49.040
that they are not billionaires because they
they waive someone's rent.

496
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:53.000
That he then has ulterior motives.

497
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.120
I just don't think
that he will waive the rent.

498
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.160
Then you would be a puppet
of a billionaire.

499
00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:01.160
Puppet of a billionaire?

500
00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.160
A very
conspiracy-theory statement.

501
00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.000
Do not think
that I'm going to what I say,

502
00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.200
come through my own thoughts
and am convinced of it?

503
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.600
Well, there must be a
very nice older gentleman,

504
00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:16.000
who slips you a few bills.

505
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.520
The financial
of this venture is confidential.

506
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.160
That's what I'm sticking to.

507
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.280
You can assume
that what I am saying

508
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.440
and that many people like,

509
00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:29.280
fully corresponds to my conviction
corresponds

510
00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.680
and that I am not the puppet
of a billionaire.

511
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.520
Is this a single gentleman
or are there several,

512
00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.560
who put money in your pocket?
I can say...

513
00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:43.680
You could also make your own lemonade
and sell it in front of the house.

514
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:48.960
Many people are very interested
in financing this.

515
00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.720
I believe,
also because we in Germany

516
00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:55.840
an enormous imbalance
between very left media have

517
00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.240
and virtually no media at all
on the other hand.

518
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.520
Ingrid, how long do we have?

519
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.160
* not to understand *

520
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.160
That's it.

521
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.920
When do we always stop, 29:30?

522
00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.920
Then we make
live on tape today, huh?

523
00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:13.320
Was it exactly 29:30?
There is the clock.

524
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.800
Whoa, pro.

525
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:21.840
So, that was Pulver-Reichelt
at "Chez Krömer".

526
00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:25.480
Am I coming now?
Nah, nah, you stay here.

527
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.160
Oh, good.
And...

528
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.840
... bye.
Bye, have a nice evening.

529
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.880
* Charles Aznavour sets *

530
00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:47.120
# You are the one for me, for me

531
00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:49.400
# For me, formidable

532
00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:50.960
