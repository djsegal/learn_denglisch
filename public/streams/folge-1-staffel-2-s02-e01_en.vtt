1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.720
I'm going to the abattoir.
He should find something.

4
00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.840
Why doesn't the little one go?
Are you crazy?

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.560
Toni goes to school,
we go to work.

6
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.400
I'm still here.

7
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.640
This must not become public.

8
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.720
My name
is on the shipping documents.

9
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.720
There is phosgene in the wagons,

10
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.400
a banned
chemical warfare agent.

11
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.200
With this quantity you could

12
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.960
in a city like Berlin
destroy all life.

13
00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.480
In Wormsstraße
there's a cellar hole.

14
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.840
This is the headquarters
of the "Red Fortress".

15
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.520
It's still fresh.

16
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.600
Leaves that hang in the press,
is called a roller king.

17
00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.120
AB 3221
 Istanbul.

18
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.680
(Dearest Helga, I can't live our
secrecy any longer.

19
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.640
You say you can't
just start over in Berlin.

20
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480
But I can't
back to Cologne.

21
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.960
Back to a life,
that shies away from the truth.

22
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.560
Forgive me.
Gereon.)

23
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.400
Get out of here.
What about you?

24
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.960
Get lost!

25
00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.320
*dark music*

26
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.640
*Water flows.

27
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.920
*dark music*

28
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.120
*The phone rings.

29
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.720
*There's a knock.

30
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.000
(Elisabeth) Mr. Rath? For you.

31
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.480
Just a moment.

32
00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.600
Yes, please?

33
00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:35.400
(Mrs.) Government Councillor Benda
would like to speak to you.

34
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.560
(Benda) Rath?
Mr. Government Councillor?

35
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.480
We found Kardakov
last night.

36
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.560
Together with 14 other dead.

37
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.600
*exciting music*

38
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.680
The head of the homicide squad
is on site.

39
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.400
The Buddha?
In person.

40
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.440
*exciting music*

41
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.840
That's him.

42
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.120
Don't ask too many questions.
He will come to you.

43
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.320
(May I introduce you?

44
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.760
Detective Inspector Gennat,
Head of the homicide squad.

45
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.320
Come with us.

46
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.880
How did you identify him?

47
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.840
(Gennat) A telegram
was in his jacket pocket.

48
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.200
Let me see that, Krüger.

49
00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.960
Is it coded?
- Yes, it is.

50
00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.640
But take a look
at the receiver.

51
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.600
Kardakov.
(Gennat) Russian.

52
00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.360
Who knows Russian?

53
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.480
Me, Mr. Kriminalrat.
- Go ahead, Czerwinski.

54
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.480
Yes, Mr. Kriminalrat.

55
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.760
Vice
is now also doing murder, yes?

56
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.880
The case is also important for the
political police.

57
00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.480
Your presence makes that unmistakably
understandable, Mr. Government Councillor.

58
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.400
By all appearances, the
the 13 men and two women

59
00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.000
liquidated with machine guns.

60
00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.120
Plus shot in the neck.
- All of them?

61
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.320
Yes, they obviously wanted
to be on the safe side.

62
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.800
We have found projectiles
in the neck area.

63
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.000
Look like 7.62s.

64
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.880
A real firing squad.

65
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.800
Which one of them is Kardakov?

66
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.360
Here ... the six.

67
00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.760
Do you see?

68
00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.480
In the back of the head.
Shot at close range.

69
00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.400
Despite a dozen bullets
from machine guns.

70
00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.680
"Red Fortress".

71
00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.520
Henning, give him a hand.

72
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.000
This is not Kardakov.

73
00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.160
(Benda)
Who could that have been?

74
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.160
Soviet secret service?
I suspect so.

75
00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.520
Gennat, what do you mean?
- Impressive evidence.

76
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.800
In a few hours
we'll hear about ballistics.

77
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.680
But ... except for the Russians

78
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.320
only the Swedes use
such large-caliber weapons.

79
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.400
For moose shooting.

80
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.320
There are no moose in Berlin.

81
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.240
The matter is delicate,
politically speaking.

82
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:52.880
I'm not interested in politics.
I am a simple criminal.

83
00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.680
I have 15 murders here,
that's no mean feat.

84
00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.960
How you categorize my results
politically,

85
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.320
is up to you.

86
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.400
But our goal is the same.
We want the perpetrators.

87
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.480
So, Mr. Rath ...

88
00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.160
The government council says,
Are you familiar with the subject?

89
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.880
Then put together
a commission.

90
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:15.360
Get to work.

91
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.600
*He clears his throat.

92
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.640
Thank you.

93
00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.000
*uncanny music

94
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.360
*rhythmic music

95
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.960
15 dead. Only one was missing.
Alexei Kardakov.

96
00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.280
You see, you know your way around.

97
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.880
That's why I would like to have you
as my assistant.

98
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.800
What is it, are you in?

99
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:56.520
Commissioner, that honors me.
But ...

100
00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:57.760
What?

101
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.480
I know someone
who knows much better.

102
00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.920
But I want you.

103
00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.960
Yes, but everything I know
I know from ...

104
00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.640
If I wanted Charlotte Ritter,
I would have asked her.

105
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.400
So, can I count on you?

106
00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:15.400
Good.

107
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.960
You were
in this print shop.

108
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.120
Anything conspicuous?

109
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.800
Well, the roller king.

110
00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:27.560
A freight paper.
Stuck in one of the rollers.

111
00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.600
Our throttle cable should probably
be sent to Istanbul.

112
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.680
Uh-huh. And where is it?
I don't know.

113
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.800
Maybe she kept it.

114
00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.560
Keep it?

115
00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.160
Well, well,
it wasn't completely clean,

116
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.440
how we got in there.

117
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.280
The woman doesn't know how to
how to spell the word "legal".

118
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.720
Half hour 25 pfennigs,
second towel a sixpence.

119
00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.800
One towel is enough, thank you.

120
00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.000
Then come along.

121
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.640
Heads or tails?
 Tails.

122
00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:13.880
Good, you first.

123
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.440
And now
a little speed.

124
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:27.640
Still nothing?
Hm?

125
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.440
From the man from Cologne?
M-m.

126
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.360
He's written me off,
I'm afraid.

127
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.160
And the other one?

128
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.640
The little one.
Stefan?

129
00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.760
Oh, he's a gusher.

130
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.320
And Rudi?

131
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.160
Hm, he doesn't show up either
the pipe.

132
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.480
Did you do something wrong?

133
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.840
Me?

134
00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.440
Nah, what makes you think that?

135
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680
Well ...

136
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.360
What?

137
00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.240
Well, sometimes you might be
a bit cheeky.

138
00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.480
Tell me ...!

139
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:05.320
Three boys on the keel,
but all gone?

140
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.560
Pff, oh you!

141
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:10.240
Just because you're freshly
fried by your Willi.

142
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.560
His name is Fritz!

143
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:14.760
So, out now. It's my turn.
That's not fair.

144
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.760
Why?
Fifteen minutes each.

145
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.360
Nothing there, it's
Heat - length - dirt.

146
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.560
What's that supposed to be?
You had the hot water.

147
00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.000
I get more time
in your broth.

148
00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.240
And now get out!

149
00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.280
*Lierbox music

150
00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.480
For you.

151
00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.480
Well, open up.

152
00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.680
Me?
- Well, who else?

153
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.320
Him or what?

154
00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.560
Huh? Old bag.
*incomprehensible mumbling*

155
00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.280
(Psch!

156
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.960
Mother is asleep.

157
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:10.480
Wow!

158
00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.120
Come on.

159
00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.200
*Dog barking from outside

160
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.400
From him.

161
00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.400
Thank you.

162
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.400
Try it on.

163
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.400
Sure! Dat du denn kiekst, or what?

164
00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.920
Do you want it or not?

165
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.280
From.

166
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.400
Good money.
- For good goods.

167
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.240
Excuse me, where can I find
Miss Ritter?

168
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.640
Upstairs under the roof.

169
00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.240
Thank you.

170
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.160
*noise from outside

171
00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.760
*removed voices*

172
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.000
Mother?

173
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.160
Mom?

174
00:12:57.400 --> 00:12:58.520
*There's a knock.

175
00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:01.760
*dark music*

176
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:09.400
Hello, am I in the right place
with the Ritter family?

177
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.240
It depends,
what you want.

178
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.800
I'm looking for Charlotte.

179
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.480
Have the punters come running
run home, or what?

180
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.800
Get out of here.
She's not here.

181
00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.720
And don't show your face again
or you'll be in trouble.

182
00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.400
It's official.
Do you understand?

183
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:34.760
Oh, so you're from Alex?
Why don't you say so?

184
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.120
What do you want now?

185
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.560
Do you know where Lotte is?
- Today is bathing day.

186
00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.160
Volksbad. Gerichtsstraße.
Around the corner.

187
00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:52.760
Is that enough, or should I
make a drawing?

188
00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.640
Man, man, man.

189
00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.240
*dark music*

190
00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.880
What's wrong with you again?

191
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:03.640
It looks good.

192
00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.920
What happened
with your child?

193
00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:17.920
I gave it away.

194
00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.840
But it's alive?
 Mmm.

195
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.440
Where?

196
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.760
Here in the city somewhere.

197
00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.400
I suppose.

198
00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.720
What is it called?
It didn't have a name yet.

199
00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.960
Boy or girl?
A boy.

200
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.440
Hajo.
No.

201
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.360
Why? "Hajo" is beautiful.

202
00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.720
I call him
the "little Häwelmann".

203
00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:41.960
For me.

204
00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.800
Hajo Häwelmann.

205
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.640
*She laughs.

206
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.000
*ringing*

207
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.520
*demanding knock*

208
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.000
This can't be true!

209
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:54.680
I'll do it.

210
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920
*knock*

211
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:58.800
Don't dry here for a second.

212
00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:00.400
Well, I don't believe it!

213
00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.560
Where is the paper
from the print shop?

214
00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:05.160
First you send me
to the devil

215
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.560
and then you come back
and want something else?

216
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.760
I want the evidence.

217
00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.760
You have always
have always been denied.

218
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.360
I didn't want to
talk to you.

219
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.800
Give me the document.
I threw it away.

220
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.160
That was evidence!

221
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.440
You promised me,

222
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.360
that we can solve the case
can solve the case together.

223
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:30.200
You lied to me.
I didn't.

224
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:35.400
Yes, you have betrayed my trust
and spied on me.

225
00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.000
The evidence
is in a safe place.

226
00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.320
Where?

227
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:52.560
I will give you
the correct wagon number

228
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.240
and you give me
another chance.

229
00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:56.760
Why should I?

230
00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.840
I apologize too.

231
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:01.000
And if you insist,

232
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:03.680
I will explain
the circumstances.

233
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:07.840
Put something on first.

234
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.760
*calm, suspenseful music

235
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.360
*metallic tapping*

236
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.240
Can you hold on a minute?

237
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.640
Thank you.

238
00:17:26.720 --> 00:17:27.760
I see.

239
00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:30.440
But that is strange.

240
00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:31.760
*He sighs.

241
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.000
Hm. But it has to be here.

242
00:17:43.120 --> 00:17:44.120
Ah yes!

243
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.360
Transfer documents
for one wagon: AB 3221.

244
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:02.560
Pass this on.

245
00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.280
Gentlemen,
this is Commissioner Rath from Cologne.

246
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.400
Hello.
(Hello.

247
00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:16.480
He conducts an investigation ordered by the
personally ordered investigation.

248
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:17.920
Which is?

249
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.600
The starting point is
an unidentified corpse,

250
00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.800
which floated in the Landwehr Canal.

251
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.480
The Russian? Why not
a special commission?

252
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.280
We have them now.
Inspector Rath came across a lead,

253
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.760
that goes far beyond the exile milieu
far beyond the exile milieu.

254
00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.800
The man was a railwayman
and had a secret mission.

255
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:43.720
He was tortured before he died.
That's common practice with them.

256
00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.800
We assume
a political crime.

257
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:51.520
The deceased belonged to a
Russian resistance organization,

258
00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.120
the "Red Fortress".

259
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:56.680
They want the fall of Stalin
in the Soviet Union.

260
00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.400
Who wouldn't want that?
*laughter*

261
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.480
The 15 corpses from the pine forest

262
00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.520
were members
of this "Red Fortress".

263
00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:07.920
But we are still looking
for the head of the group,

264
00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.200
a certain Alexei Kardakov.

265
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.880
What does the murder
have to do with Russian extremists?

266
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.720
Inspector Rath found
a consignment note,

267
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:21.280
who involves this organization in
in an explosive smuggling operation.

268
00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.560
The chief of police ordered
the train under surveillance,

269
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:29.000
with which the railwayman
came to Berlin.

270
00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.360
Is that enough for you?
So, go on. What else do we have?

271
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.960
The body in the cement.
Ah yes, that's right.

272
00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.880
Fresh details, please.

273
00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:38.720
Construction site Ackerstraße.

274
00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.520
A foreman was there
yesterday morning ...

275
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.800
(Gennat) When exactly?
- 6.45 a.m.

276
00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.320
... a human foot
in the foundation.

277
00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.240
The cement had already been
been poured for days.

278
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.480
Yesterday they pried it open
and recovered a dead man,

279
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.440
whose clothing enables a clear
assignment.

280
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:00.800
(What is it?
- A sutane.

281
00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.560
The man
was obviously a priest.

282
00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.840
(Gennat) Already identified?

283
00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.600
They are still
busy with it,

284
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:11.400
the corpse
from the stuff.

285
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.480
But we have
a bullet wound.

286
00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.480
*exciting music*

287
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.680
Where is the dead man?

288
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.800
On the way to the autopsy.

289
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:23.400
To Dr. Schwarz?
Yes.

290
00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.000
I don't have to go there.
I know him.

291
00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.960
This is St. Joseph.

292
00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.480
(Henning?

293
00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:33.280
That's him.

294
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:36.160
That's not good at all.

295
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:39.240
Böhm, this is your case.

296
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.520
Shall be.

297
00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.560
(Gennat) Gentlemen,
Thank you.

298
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.880
*exciting music*

299
00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.440
(Have the honor!

300
00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.840
What brings the Cologne custom to me?
I am now Berlin and murder.

301
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.480
The priest, where is he?
The one from this morning.

302
00:21:07.720 --> 00:21:11.400
In the ready-to-wear section. Just finished.
Can I see it?

303
00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:14.240
Chief Superintendent Böhm
announced.

304
00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.680
It's about ballistics.
I see.

305
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:28.720
Well, he doesn't exactly look like a clergyman
he doesn't exactly look like a clergyman.

306
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.760
*exciting music*

307
00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:40.760
How did he die?

308
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.600
Cardiac arrest.

309
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.640
After deliberate external influence.

310
00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.360
There.

311
00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:02.680
Thank you.

312
00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.960
*exciting music*

313
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.720
*Music intensifies.

*exciting music*

317
00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.400
I'll take the bullet with me.

318
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.320
For God's sake,
please don't touch it!

319
00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.480
The Buddha is killing me.

320
00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.800
New rules.

321
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.560
Absurd.

322
00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:25.520
But the success
proves Gennat right.

323
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.800
Please.
Thank you.

324
00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.600

325
00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:50.640
*Door is unlocked.

00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.280
(quietly) Wegener.

*He clears his throat.

328
00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.880
They are sent from heaven.

329
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:11.440
Here is the annual report.

330
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.760
The Annual General Meeting has been brought forward
to this evening at 6 p.m.

331
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.600
*Nyssen clears his throat.

332
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.800
That should
only take place next week.

333
00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.680
Your mother's wish.

334
00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:29.880
Don't worry, you still have
enough time to freshen up.

335
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:41.400
Who is this St. Joseph?
Josef Wilczek. Very heavy boy.

336
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.400
Do the dirty work
for the underworld.

337
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.000
Belongs to the Armenian.

338
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.920
Local underworld great.
Here in Berlin.

339
00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.920
Did you already say: local.

340
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.960
How is he supposed to know
that I mean Berlin?

341
00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.160
I know who the Armenian is.
I had dealings with him. Thank you.

342
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.560
(Jänicke) Mr. Commissioner?

343
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:04.800
Just for the sake of form:

344
00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.400
How are the tasks
tasks in your commission?

345
00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:10.000
You are my assistant.

346
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:13.360
Czerwinski and Henning
are special investigators.

347
00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.680
And she is
the recorder.

348
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.960
You know Miss Ritter?
 Yes.

349
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.400
Good. Tell me, the telegram,
were you able to decipher it?

350
00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.640
Oh my goodness!
I forgot about that.

351
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:27.000
Heidewitzka!
- But at the drop of a hat!

352
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.800
(Jänicke) Mr. Rath!

353
00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.480
Should I come along?
Or me?

354
00:25:31.720 --> 00:25:33.760
No, I'm going alone.
Mr. Rath!

355
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.240
What is it?
We didn't know ...

356
00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.880
They're waiting there.
Who?

357
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.560
Well, your relatives.

358
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200
Junior!

359
00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:04.880
*quiet piano music

360
00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.880
Commissioner.

361
00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:20.720
Yes, come in.

362
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:27.800
That's quite a surprise.
You wouldn't have thought it, would you?

363
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:34.800
Your idea?

364
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.920
Nope, moms.

365
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.680
Didn't you get my letter
did you not get my letter?

366
00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:42.960
Yes, it is.

367
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:46.560
Moritz, will you leave your uncle
and me alone for a moment?

368
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.360
Your brother Anno has
officially declared dead.

369
00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:01.440
The official certificate,
it has arrived.

370
00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.200
He is no longer
as missing.

371
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:07.760
He is now definitively
classified as "fallen".

372
00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.240
And now?

373
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.240
We're here if that's what you want.

374
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.720
Bruno, I need your help.

375
00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:43.920
Stop.

376
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:48.280
That's right.

377
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.800
Madame ...

378
00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:54.560
Thank you, Bruno.

379
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:59.400
So, here we go.
See you tonight!

380
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:18.000
(I want to murder.)

381
00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.880
((Woman) You want to go to the murder?
There are no women here.)

382
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.480
We didn't find out,
the cement.

383
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:31.160
It was too dry.
Aha, thank you. Goodbye.

384
00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.000
*exciting music*

385
00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:52.880
*exciting music*

386
00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:40.480
(Here.

387
00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.920
A little reminder of your
exciting time in the capital).

388
00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.600
Yes?

389
00:29:56.840 --> 00:29:57.840
How do you do?

390
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:01.320
I'm supposed to deliver this
for Chief Superintendent Böhm.

391
00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.400
Ah, St. Joseph.

392
00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:06.800
I've already heard.

393
00:30:09.480 --> 00:30:13.200
Let's see then,
who's got it in for him.

394
00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.680
Just a moment.

395
00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.440
Sign.

396
00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.440
Of course.

397
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:33.960
Thank you.

398
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.240
We'll know more tomorrow.

399
00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.000
Well, girl, where do you want to go?

400
00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:55.520
Sorry,
I'm looking for my sister.

401
00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.760
She works here.

402
00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.480
Charlotte Ritter.
- Well, let's find out.

403
00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:09.000
How are we supposed to pay for it?
We don't even have the three marks.

404
00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:12.360
(They'll pick them up,
that's the easiest thing.

405
00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.800
(Ilse) That must be possible,

406
00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.320
that we get them
get them underground.

407
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:20.400
It just isn't.
- That's what YOU say.

408
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:36.760
Is from the medical officer.

409
00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.400
He wants three marks.

410
00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.920
Call the Charité,
for them to come and get her.

411
00:31:48.120 --> 00:31:49.160
Why?

412
00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.480
They take them as a gift.

413
00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:53.920
Do you know
what they're doing to her?

414
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.320
It doesn't matter if she's dead.

415
00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.680
Do you want to pay the Grieneisen
with his crematorium?

416
00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:03.400
Do you know how much it costs?

417
00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.000
Mother won't come to the Charité.
I don't want that.

418
00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.200
I don't want
that they're messing with her.

419
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.200
Well, then take care of it.
- (Ilse) And you'll pay for it too.

420
00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.600
I will.

421
00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.880
You'll have to meow a lot
with your kitty,

422
00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.600
until you have the 80 markers together.

423
00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:30.360
... Order figures in the
Excavators and freezers

424
00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.560
have consolidated.

425
00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:36.480
We look forward with hope
the expansion of the rail network

426
00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.160
in the southwest of Germany.

427
00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.120
(Wegener) ... financial situation
can be stabilized,

428
00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.320
and that in difficult times,

429
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:48.680
in which some
of our partner companies

430
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:51.200
and competitors in the German Reich

431
00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:54.600
from our core businesses
have left our core businesses.

432
00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:57.520
The market
has expanded as a result,

433
00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:00.360
and the new possibilities
are enormous.

434
00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:04.120
To analyze this
and to develop a creative

435
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:07.400
and at the same time
economic-conservative view

436
00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:10.800
into the future of Nyssen AG
into the future of Nyssen AG,

437
00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.880
should be the aim of today's
shareholders' meeting today.

438
00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.560
For the presentation
of the annual report of Nyssen AG

439
00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:21.160
We would like to welcome
Mrs. Annemarie Nyssen.

440
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.400
*applause*

441
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.160
(Mrs. Nyssen) Thank you.

442
00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.640
We have good news today

443
00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:38.960
and the unpleasant
in harmony.

444
00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.800
Pleasing
is our annual financial statement.

445
00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.560
The balance sheet '28
is something to be proud of,

446
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.760
contrary to
all the gloomy prophecies.

447
00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.480
The rumors are unpleasant,

448
00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:56.200
which these days
circulating around our company

449
00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:59.560
and which of course
are completely unfounded.

450
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:01.800
To calm the situation,

451
00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.720
we have nevertheless
drawn consequences

452
00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.520
and my son Alfred

453
00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:11.200
from all duties
within the Board of Directors.

454
00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:15.320
The Supervisory Board hereby follows
Alfred's own request,

455
00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:19.440
to focus exclusively on
to look after our foundation.

456
00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.480
We all wish him
strength and vision

457
00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:25.400
and thank
for their energy and expertise,

458
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.760
with which he has
years.

459
00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:40.600
In our previous year's
annual report

460
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:43.280
we have
to the favorable economic

461
00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.480
of the year 1927,

462
00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:49.000
but especially had to
draw attention to this,

463
00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:51.400
that the ascent is mainly

464
00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:55.360
one by the then
abundant foreign loans

465
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.640
favorable sales on the
on the domestic market.

466
00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.400
*Your voice
fades into the background.

467
00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.880
*mumble*

468
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.720
*Crack*

469
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.360
*dark music*

470
00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:21.720
Your steppie,
how old is he?

471
00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.120
Twelve.

472
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.800
You didn't say anything,
that you have a son.

473
00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.280
Moritz is also
not my son.

474
00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:33.920
I see.
No, no, he's my nephew.

475
00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:38.240
Oh, your sister's son.
Is Helga your sister?

476
00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.680
No, that's my sister-in-law.

477
00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.640
Moritz is my brother's son
my brother's son.

478
00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.120
My fallen brother.

479
00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.320
And Helga is the widow.

480
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.960
Now I've got it!

481
00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:55.880
With widows,
I know my way around.

482
00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:05.160
Well?
Has Emmi already shown you everything?

483
00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:07.840
Yes.
I get the servants' quarters.

484
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.640
Just have to
bring up the bed.

485
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.000
(quietly) Go.

486
00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:16.160
That's really very kind
of you, Mr. Wolter.

487
00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.120
Bruno!
You'll be rid of us again on Sunday.

488
00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:20.600
What about Sunday?

489
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:24.320
I speak at the Federation
for veterans and war widows.

490
00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.920
In Berlin?
For once this time.

491
00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.360
Cramped up there, isn't it?
Nope, cozy.

492
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.400
You've already
found my gloves.

493
00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:34.960
Then come with me,
you little Schmeling.

494
00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.480
(Moritz) May I try it out?

495
00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:40.720
Then come here.
Thank you.

496
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:43.480
*Wolter and Moritz in the background*

497
00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:49.920
Everyone once in Berlin.

498
00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:55.360
Do you actually know
what that means?

499
00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:58.800
*Wolter speaks in the other room.

500
00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:00.400
No more secrecy.

501
00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:09.480
Let's see your left hook.
I'm Delarge, you're Schmeling.

502
00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:16.560
Yes, cover!
Pay attention to the cover.

503
00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.800
And ...

504
00:37:19.920 --> 00:37:21.120
*slaps, groans*

505
00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:27.160
*Wolter groans, Moritz laughs.

506
00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:30.720
Zack! And Delarge
takes to the boards.

507
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.280
*He groans.

508
00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:38.000
Excuse me, Mr. Wolter.
Is that a G 88?

509
00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:40.400
You know your way around, right?

510
00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:44.640
Yes, this is the 88 rifle.

511
00:37:47.880 --> 00:37:49.800
Have you ever held one in your hand?

512
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:55.640
Has served me faithfully.
Now in well-deserved retirement.

513
00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.960
(military) And put it on!

514
00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:05.200
Uh!

515
00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.320
All right, come on.

516
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.400
Bruno,
Mr. Rath is now staying here too,

517
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.200
if you don't mind.

518
00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.000
Make yourselves at home.

519
00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.440
Thank you, Bruno.

520
00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.320
Nice to have you here.

521
00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.760
Good night.
- Good night.

522
00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.920
I'll wake you up at seven.
- Mmm.

523
00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:42.680
Are you chasing a murderer?
Not one.

524
00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.600
More like a whole pack.
But you know ...

525
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:48.600
Otherwise ...

526
00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.520
Exactly.

527
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.800
Sleep well.

528
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:57.760
*There's a knock.

529
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.520
Mr. Nyssen?

530
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.280
Mr. Nyssen!

531
00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:09.520
(Nyssen, echoing)
I don't need anything, thank you.

532
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.800
The countess is here.

533
00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:14.880
Who?

534
00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.800
Miss Sorokina.

535
00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.280
(yells)
They won't even let you in!

536
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.840
She's already inside.

537
00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:23.480
In the salon.

538
00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:28.200
Here, now?

539
00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:32.280
She's been waiting for three hours.
I couldn't get her up...

540
00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.480
What else do you want here?

541
00:40:24.640 --> 00:40:27.800
My father
had this wagon built.

542
00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:30.520
Shortly before the revolution.

543
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:34.920
And then he hid him
from the Bolsheviks.

544
00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.520
For twelve years.

545
00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:50.800
I have been trying for years,

546
00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.520
the treasure of my family
from the clutches of Stalin.

547
00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.800
Your move was my last chance.

548
00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:03.280
And?

549
00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:10.120
Since the tank car has been in Berlin,
nobody has opened it.

550
00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.960
Have you seen the freight?

551
00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:23.800
The gold?

552
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.800
Have you seen the gold?

553
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:27.240
Yes.

554
00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.800
*exciting music*

555
00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.640
Still closed.

556
00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.240
Gloria, today you are
number 12 on my list today,

557
00:41:57.480 --> 00:42:00.800
and I want to finish early
finish work as early as possible.

558
00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.200
Wilczek, St. Joseph?
- I know him. And?

559
00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:06.720
When does the
making its rounds with you?

560
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.360
Which day, I mean.

561
00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.280
Well, on Sundays.
It's a priest.

562
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.280
And he was also
here this Sunday?

563
00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:16.520
Yes.

564
00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:20.560
And who else? Who else was there?
From us, I mean?

565
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.960
Well, Bruno.

566
00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.800
And one like that,
I didn't know him yet.

567
00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.560
Looked good,
but didn't say much.

568
00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.560
And when did they leave?

569
00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:34.400
Well, Wolter stayed here,
until we closed.

570
00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.720
And the other one?

571
00:42:36.880 --> 00:42:39.600
The ... I haven't seen him
no longer seen,

572
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.280
after St. Joseph was here.

573
00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.360
Oops, now I've said something.
