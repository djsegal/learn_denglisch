00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
.

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.360
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.720
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.480
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.880
* Pling *

6
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.720
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.320
Harald Glööckler and Billy King.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.520
Mr. Glööckler?
Yes?

9
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.800
You brought the dog?
No, the dog me.

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.640
I see.
(laughs) Mhm.

11
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.560
I'll start again,
this is new information.

12
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.720
Harald Glööckler and Billy King,
56 years and eleven years.

13
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.200
Fashion designer and entrepreneur
as well as writer and dog.

14
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.800
I would come in now.

15
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.800
Mr. Glööckler?
Yes, very much so.

16
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.760
I would come in. - Yes, with pleasure.
Then now. - Yes.

17
00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.520
Is the dog somehow ...
It lies there.

18
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.920
"What kind of manufacturer is that?",
I was about to say.

19
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.800
What kind of dog is this?

20
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.800
This is a Papillon, actually
he is 70 years old and I am 56.

21
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.240
Papillon means butterfly, right?
Yes, a French breed of dog.

22
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.320
A French butterfly.
Yes, because the ears look like this.

23
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.080
Come on, lie down.
Come here, Billie. Come.

24
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.560
Oh, you're talking to the dog.
I come in.

25
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.560
We do not have to do everything
over the intercom.

26
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.160
Come here.
Oh.

27
00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.840
All good. Come on, Billy.
It's all right, yeah? - Yeah.

28
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.520
Why doesn't he have a muzzle?
Because you don't have one either.

29
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.520
Why don't you have a muzzle?
Is it dangerous?

30
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.200
Actually, no.
Dogs that bark don't bite.

31
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.080
(laughs) But he doesn't bark.
Yes ... But you bark sometimes.

32
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.160
Come, come. All good.
Here we go.

33
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.880
Would you like something to drink?
A water perhaps.

34
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.560
Does the dog get special water,
is there gold dust in it?

35
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.480
No, there is no gold dust in it.
Take a look ...

36
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.720
Look, beautiful. I am speechless.
So, you get this.

37
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.400
Come out of the refrigerator.
Otherwise, animal welfare will call.

38
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.760
Then we get nasty letters.
You're doing a great job.

39
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.920
I used to have a budgie.
Did you? You ...

40
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.520
The sound man, too. - Yes?
Yes. - Well, let's get started.

41
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080
They have so many business areas,

42
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.080
that after eternal research we could not yet
not been able to find out everything.

43
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.280
What do you actually do?
Yes, I ask myself that too.

44
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.640
I ask myself the same question.
Actually, I have ...

45
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.840
with six years decided,

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.520
to make the world more beautiful and
women into princesses.

47
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.280
Then I ...
We'll get to that in a moment.

48
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.520
Yes, but...
This is the second chapter.

49
00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.800
Then I began to create everything
what you need for this.

50
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.400
That is why there are of houses from me,

51
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.640
about Tiny houses ...
The latest is a luxury beach chair.

52
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.480
We have here. On their website
there are 48 different categories

53
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.080
with 789 products for sale.

54
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.240
Bathtubs, dog collars,
a cuckoo clock for almost 7000 euros.

55
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.680
Who buys them,
we'll get to that in a moment.

56
00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.120
There are also
Laminate and beach chairs. - Yes.

57
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.600
Mass instead of class?
How's the business going there?

58
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.600
A cuckoo clock for 7000 euros
is now not mass instead of class.

59
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.680
That is, of course, the hammer.
That's the most expensive product, isn't it?

60
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.280
No, my pictures are more expensive.
You have pictures too?

61
00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.480
Paintings that are well discussed
by art historians.

62
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.000
A painting can cost 50,000.
But ... How much?

63
00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.040
50. - 50.000?
What's on there then?

64
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.080
Paint I smeared on it.
Oh, right.

65
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.080
Paint up, 50,000 euros.
Why I don't do that ...

66
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.680
Why am I sitting here?
I don't know that either.

67
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.760
But you are...
Do you paint?

68
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.920
Yes, when I hear that,
I'll start painting tomorrow.

69
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.200
Yeah, so.
50.000? - Yes.

70
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.520
Does anyone ask why?
No, the ...

71
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.200
When someone pays the money,
he does not ask why.

72
00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.120
They are reviewed
by art historians from Vienna,

73
00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.240
from Germany, who think,
I paint like Caravaggio,

74
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.880
Picasso, Roy Lichtenstein, Warhol.

75
00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.720
What are the names of these art historians,
who say that?

76
00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.400
Dr. Julia Pfeffer
from the University in Vienna

77
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.680
or Prof. Dr. Bathelt
here in Germany. - Crass.

78
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.640
Would they say that about me, too,
to anyone? - I don't know.

79
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.120
We need to see
see your paintings.

80
00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.360
Can I also paint a picture
and say mine costs 52,000?

81
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.120
Yes, you can do it.

82
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.800
The only question is,
whether anyone will pay for it.

83
00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.560
You just take products
and slap your name on it, right?

84
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.880
No, no.
Just not, just not.

85
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.880
Everything that Harald Glööckler does,
is completely rebooted.

86
00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.560
Whether that is wallpaper,
whether that is fashion.

87
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.960
I am also very strenuous there,

88
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.840
because nothing can come out that I haven't
I have not taken off by then.

89
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.880
But are you making it right?

90
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.200
Let's say,
I went to the hardware store,

91
00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.400
there you lie then
half naked on laminate.

92
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.000
Yes, that was a testimonial thing.

93
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.400
There is then
a Glööckler stamp on it?

94
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.000
That's when I got paid
that I lie down naked.

95
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.760
On laminate? - Yes.
And then it becomes more expensive, right?

96
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.960
A laminate, what per square meter
7 euros, then costs ...

97
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.000
No, I advertised the laminate.
8 euros, or ...

98
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.760
That was not my laminate,
I was a testimonial.

99
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.400
But, for example, the wallpaper ...

100
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.920
But don't you feel silly
when you have to advertise laminate?

101
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.200
Feel silly,
when you get a call:

102
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.760
"We'll pay a few hundred thousand,
if you lie down"?

103
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.400
Is that so, a hundred thousand?
A few. - A few? So 300.

104
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.760
For example.
200.

105
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.000
250.000.
The first one was not bad.

106
00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.720
300.000?
For example.

107
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.960
Well, chapeau.
I think that's good.

108
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.200
Then I'll do that, too.

109
00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:14.160
That's the point: that Harald
Glööckler is the brand itself.

110
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.960
I have created
created myself as a brand

111
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.200
and therefore this complexity.

112
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.040
I do everything in licenses,
look for partners,

113
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.240
when I want to make wallpaper,
produce the wallpaper.

114
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.000
Is this a franchise company
like McDonald's? - No, different.

115
00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.320
I give the name, they produce
and distribute: a licensing business.

116
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.440
Franchise is different.
A pure licensing business, yes.

117
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.680
But there are also Pompöös cafes.

118
00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.800
(laughs) There's everything.
Yes.

119
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.560
You became really well known
you became through teleshopping.

120
00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:50.120
Here is an excerpt that was also
on "Kalkofes Mattscheibe".

121
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.360
You sell the cream on the side,
it's gone in a minute.

122
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.400
As earlier in the chorus: "Cabbage and turnips
have driven me away.

123
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.960
If my mother had cooked meat,
I would have stayed home.

124
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:06.400
(woman) No, we dare ...
If the mother had cooked meat ...

125
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.880
I sing and then you start.

126
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.000
(sings) Cabbage and turnips
would have driven me away.

127
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.920
If the mother ...
(sings) Cabbage and turnips ...

128
00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.160
If the mother had...
We're still practicing that.

129
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.760
Was that already the persiflage
or was that you?

130
00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.240
That was me.
* (LAUGHING)

131
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:27.200
But something is put into the world
and everyone repeats it.

132
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.760
I did not become
known through teleshopping,

133
00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.880
but through big shows
with world stars.

134
00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.920
Because of this notoriety
took me teleshopping.

135
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:37.560
Which shows were they?

136
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.280
These were shows from 1994 to 1999,

137
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:48.440
big fashion shows in Stuttgart,
in Düsseldorf, in Hong Kong.

138
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.840
Fashion shows? - Fashion presentations
with Gina Lollobrigida, Chaka Khan.

139
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.360
I was known for big gowns
and shows before.

140
00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.360
Someone once wrote that I became
through teleshopping.

141
00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:04.120
Then it is written on Wikipedia
and is always ...

142
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:07.280
Many people make fun
about teleshopping,

143
00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:10.360
but you are earning
a golden ass, right?

144
00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.000
I am no longer with them.

145
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.720
But when you were there,
you had a good laugh, didn't you?

146
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:19.320
Well, in America this has
a big issue for a long time.

147
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.640
Ivana Trump has sold via teleshopping
and so have many others.

148
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.520
Germany sometimes takes longer.
Today, no one laughs there anymore.

149
00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:33.000
Through your products
you have become a multimillionaire.

150
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.760
Oh, I don't know that at all.

151
00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:36.680
It's easy to do the math,

152
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.200
if one assumes a picture
for 50,000 euros.

153
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:44.080
So we have 350,000
on the account already.

154
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.080
They made so much money,

155
00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:48.960
why did you
participated in the "jungle camp"?

156
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:52.000
It wasn't about money.
No, no.

157
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.840
Simple: I've been asked for eleven years
for the jungle camp for eleven years.

158
00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.600
The first time for the English,
because I had a documentary in England,

159
00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.400
before I got one in Germany,
that also speaks for itself.

160
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.840
Then I sat in the lockdown,
like all of us, and at some point I thought:

161
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.840
Nothing goes forward, nothing
backwards, you sit in the garden,

162
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.160
somehow you need publicity,
PR, must take place.

163
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:21.520
I live from taking place, from PR.
My partners also want PR.

164
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.520
Then came the request
and I thought about it:

165
00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:27.640
You can sit in the garden
in the Palatinate, in the cold,

166
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.640
or you sit down
in the heat to Australia.

167
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:35.640
Here no one sees you and there
millions of people see you.

168
00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:39.280
Is it about attention? - Yes.
An attention deficit?

169
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:42.880
Do you collapse without attention
collapse like a primrose? - No.

170
00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.240
But my partners
want publicity.

171
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.400
Oh, now, not because of you.
You would have said ...

172
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.240
I might not have ...
The second was:

173
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:55.840
I wanted people to
show this other facet of me.

174
00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:01.320
This facet ...
the everyday Mr. Glööckler.

175
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.000
Or also this person,
who rests in himself,

176
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.760
who does not need this glamour
and this weird, shrill ...

177
00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.440
"Shit," you were about to say.
Shit, yes. - Go ahead and say it.

178
00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.280
This was also very well received,

179
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:19.960
I get approached by people
who say, "Wow, cool."

180
00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:25.400
Just now also here: "Jungle,
you did a great job." Yes.

181
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.200
You have only
gone to the jungle camp,

182
00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:30.720
to make an announcement to your husband.

183
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.520
No, not true.
No? - No.

184
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.200
But you talked about it,
how it goes at home. - Yes ...

185
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.960
I have also
talked about home,

186
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.000
but the topic
is already sufficiently discussed

187
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.120
and it's all water under the bridge again.

188
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.920
But the opportunity
you have taken to say:

189
00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.400
Things are not going well at home.
No, it's not.

190
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.080
After that, did your husband ...

191
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.400
No, I said,

192
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:03.080
that I find it sad
that my husband is depressed,

193
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.080
that he is not well.

194
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:08.480
He understood that,
to that extent, yes.

195
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.160
He has also changed
about himself and started,

196
00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:16.280
to work on yourself,
to take care of yourself. - Therapy?

197
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.080
Not therapy, but a
to take care of yourself a little more.

198
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.840
That's a lot of factors.

199
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
He eats too much,
moves so little and makes...

200
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.440
He got this depression ...

201
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:34.200
He googled:
You die at 76 on average.

202
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.760
He then said:
"I won't live much longer anyway."

203
00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.920
This depression became more and more.

204
00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:43.880
In the end, you have to help yourself,
others can't.

205
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.840
This is a terrible thing.

206
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.000
He has now realized
that he has to change something.

207
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.040
I think he is on a
very good way and also had help.

208
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:58.920
Today you have Billy King with you,
who, when you were in the jungle,

209
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.160
wrote you a letter
and even a book.

210
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.160
Billy King has written a book.
We have it here.

211
00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.920
Billy King has ...
He wrote that himself?

212
00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:12.760
Yes, he wrote things
that I would never write.

213
00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:16.080
E.g. that when he
sits in a posh restaurant

214
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.440
and there sit such distinguished ladies,

215
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.360
that below the spaghetti
hang over the toe

216
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.920
and sometimes calluses
in the golden sandals.

217
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:29.080
In the golden sandals?
Yes, calluses on the feet.

218
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:32.720
Yummy. Do you want to eat something else?
Not at the moment.

219
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:35.840
Or that people
play footsie with each other,

220
00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.520
which have nothing
have anything to do with each other.

221
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:42.440
That's the kind of stuff he writes. - Did he
the audio book version?

222
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.680
Or was that another dog?
No, they do not exist yet.

223
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:48.160
But he has
made a dog fashion show.

224
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.720
Mr. Glööckler, we are now
to a difficult chapter.

225
00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:58.160
Her wish is,
to make every woman a princess.

226
00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:01.840
In your biography there is
a quote from Barbra Streisand:

227
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:06.480
"It's every woman's dream,
to be a man's dream."

228
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:10.440
Doesn't that make you think the 50s are calling
and want their image of women back?

229
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:16.720
No, I don't think so.
It's just...

230
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:22.440
After all, we want
to please at the end of the day.

231
00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.720
And living alone
no one wants to live alone either.

232
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:29.680
To be a man's dream
means, after all,

233
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.080
to be adored by this man,
to be courted,

234
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.040
to be lifted onto a pedestal.

235
00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.360
But that takes two,

236
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.680
also the men,
who make this dream come true.

237
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:44.840
This is a problem
in this day and age,

238
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.800
this is all a bit difficult.

239
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.760
You have painted the nails,
I see only now.

240
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.320
Gold, look.
Well, I'm going crazy.

241
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:55.960
3 weeks number 1 on the
Spiegel bestseller list, that's why.

242
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.000
Yes, madness.
But...

243
00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.800
Is that where the desire comes from?

244
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.400
that you lost your mother
when you were 13?

245
00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.680
This is because my mother was
was tormented by my father,

246
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.320
who was a thug.

247
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:12.400
The problem is, of course,
if you had a childhood like that...

248
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:15.880
I try again and again,
to find a moment ...

249
00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.360
There is
no second in my childhood,

250
00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.640
where I did not have to be afraid,

251
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.880
that the mother
lies bleeding on the floor or is dead.

252
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:30.520
At some point it also came
to the terrible end.

253
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.240
Your father pushed your mother
down the stairs.

254
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.080
Pushed is good, yes.
Pushed. And ...

255
00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.680
Is it true that you had
because your father ...

256
00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:45.920
He went, yes.
He went to work. - Yes.

257
00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.960
You know, the big drama is:
When you're a kid, you always think,

258
00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.640
you are partly to blame,
could have prevented it.

259
00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.800
If you then
processed over many years,

260
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.120
you eventually come to a point
that you have to realize,

261
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.800
that one is never solely to blame,
but that both have played a part.

262
00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.520
It is also a
perpetrator-victim-perpetrator relationship.

263
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.080
The bad thing is that
you'll end up with both of them.

264
00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:15.680
There you are
through with the father and mother.

265
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.720
Then at some point you should
put a lid on it,

266
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.240
because it doesn't get any better.

267
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.440
I said to myself at some point:
Why did she do this to me?

268
00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:27.120
She could have
could have left

269
00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.800
When two adults have this
that's one thing.

270
00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.560
But when kids get in the way,
it's not so funny anymore.

271
00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:39.120
Her mother was in the hospital
in the hospital and died.

272
00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:43.000
From internal bleeding, yes.
It was considered an accident.

273
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.320
When you say that,
it doesn't seem like an accident.

274
00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:50.120
No, but she had
wrested the promise from me,

275
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:53.800
that I do not talk about it
and that I don't tell anyone.

276
00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.520
The women have always told
or often still tell today,

277
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.800
they fell down the stairs,
fell.

278
00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:05.160
You know,
things were different back then,

279
00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:08.040
the doctors did not want to
to probe so much.

280
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.800
They were happy
if she only fell down.

281
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:14.160
The big drama
they didn't want to roll up.

282
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.280
And where there is no plaintiff
there is no judge.

283
00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:22.200
It is then
the injuries of internal varicose veins

284
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.680
by this fall and
succumbed to the blow of my father.

285
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:30.120
And she already knew that ...

286
00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:34.240
A friend visited her on the day
when she came to the hospital.

287
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.880
She knew,
that your father would push her down?

288
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.880
No, that she dies.
Mhm.

289
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:46.040
She said to this friend:
"What do I do when ...

290
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.800
What does my son,
when I'm gone?"

291
00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.440
That was quite terrible,

292
00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.680
but at some point you have to
put a check mark on it.

293
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.640
For me, the topic is through,
it is also in the meantime ...

294
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.760
My God, it's been 56 years.
You were 13 years. - Yes, 13.

295
00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.120
Then it was 43 years ago.

296
00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:09.680
You were a minor and lived with your
with your father for another five years.

297
00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.640
Yes, I had to.
How can you imagine that?

298
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.440
We have lived
lived side by side.

299
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.360
I have looked
disappeared under the radar

300
00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:23.440
and got out of his way.

301
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.240
But that was not easy,

302
00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:32.160
especially because this man,
I deliberately do not say my father,

303
00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:34.960
then cirrhosis of the liver
had end-stage liver cirrhosis.

304
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:40.480
He went crazy at some point
and saw white mice

305
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.120
and I had to ...

306
00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.400
He went through the house at night
and shot.

307
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:49.360
The police: "If nothing has happened
has happened, there's nothing that can be done."

308
00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:53.320
Then, at the age of 14-15
make the decision,

309
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.680
whether I dare
call the family doctor,

310
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.720
my father to the psychiatric
to have him committed,

311
00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.960
at the risk

312
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.200
that he gets out again and knows
who had him committed.

313
00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.560
I have done that two,
three times.

314
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.520
Fortunately, he didn't find out..,
that it was me.

315
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:14.040
But they let him
out again and again, he threatened them.

316
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:18.480
Were you alone with the situation?
Do you have siblings?

317
00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.000
I was alone with the situation.

318
00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.040
The BILD once wrote,
You have a brother.

319
00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:26.840
Yes, you can write a lot.
Okay.

320
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.160
Moreover, you told,

321
00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:34.360
that you yourself have also
experienced abuse.

322
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.600
Yes, that's ...

323
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:41.040
The crazy thing is that
only became clear to me again later.

324
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:46.400
This shows how great this horror
and terror was in this childhood,

325
00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.240
that I have completely
completely suppressed.

326
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.880
When so much terror happens
and so much terrible ...

327
00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.240
It was basically like when a shell
a grenade hits.

328
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:03.480
My parents had no time for me
no time for me either, of course.

329
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.440
We had
a lot of employee aunts,

330
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.760
these were all
my aunts and uncles.

331
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.280
There were also friends of the family.

332
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:20.080
One of them entrusted me to
to go somewhere with me on Sundays,

333
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.960
to some holiday park or something,
what there was at that time.

334
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.400
During one of these return trips
he thought then times:

335
00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:32.520
Well, good,
we can do something else.

336
00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.920
He forced me to..,
to attack him in places,

337
00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.480
which I do not want to
explain further.

338
00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.520
Yes, you don't have to.

339
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.040
The bad thing is,
You then come home

340
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:50.040
and can't talk about it with the
talk about it, not with the mother.

341
00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:53.800
I suppressed it and
long later it came up again,

342
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.440
because I sorted out
sorted out, there he was on it.

343
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.640
I thought: Man, this pig
has groped you.

344
00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.000
That is quite terrible.

345
00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:08.520
That is also something
what I subsequently

346
00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:11.360
additionally
chalked up to my parents,

347
00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.920
that they were also
were very negligent.

348
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.600
Were
these traumatic experiences

349
00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:20.040
the birth
for the Glööckler character? - Yes.

350
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.880
I wanted to make women's lives
more beautiful, a more beautiful world.

351
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.200
I have seen so many terrible things
that I said to myself:

352
00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.520
Now I would like
only see beautiful things.

353
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:35.360
I wanted to reinvent myself
and saw a book,

354
00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:37.520
a picture of Tutankhamun.

355
00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:40.200
I thought: But it's beautiful.
The death mask.

356
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:43.760
This is what you want to look like,
big lips, beautiful eyebrows.

357
00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.760
I always wanted to put makeup on.

358
00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:48.480
A friend of my mother
had a villa,

359
00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.120
very baroque, very opulent,
all very rich.

360
00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:54.360
Then I discovered a book
and see men make up.

361
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:58.520
In a patriarchal ...
When was that? - When I was 5-6 years old.

362
00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:03.320
My father was a butcher and in the
Country the guys were right ...

363
00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:08.000
"A man is a man"
and "Men don't put makeup on".

364
00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:12.080
Then I see a book
and there are all these men sitting there

365
00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:14.760
and have jewelry around, beads,
are made up.

366
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.560
I say, "What are they?"
"These are maharajas."

367
00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.320
"What are maharajas?"
"Kings, emperors."

368
00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.640
Then I asked my grandmother,
that is, on my mother's side,

369
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:31.600
who was very open and a woman,
who was very...

370
00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.120
Yes ... Your way of thinking at that time
was very open.

371
00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:40.320
I said:
"Can you put makeup on as a man?"

372
00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.040
"Why, do you want to put on makeup?"
I said yes and told her.

373
00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:47.960
Then she told me stories,

374
00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:52.280
that cosmetics and makeup
is much more than just painting yourself.

375
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.240
"Do you want to?"
"Yes, but you don't."

376
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.360
"Who says that, your father?

377
00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:01.720
He has nothing to say there,
It's completely uninteresting."

378
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.360
Long story short.

379
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.440
She immediately fetched her make-up things
and we started.

380
00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.240
Then I went at home sometime,
when the mother was busy,

381
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:11.880
to the cabinet,

382
00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:16.040
got the pearls and dressed up
like a maharajah.

383
00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:21.600
What I do today is actually:
Relive my childhood.

384
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.840
At some point I said:
Society has failed,

385
00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.200
left me alone with this man
alone with this man.

386
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.240
No one was there when my mother
was beaten to death,

387
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:32.040
no one cared afterwards.

388
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.960
No one has a right
to judge me.

389
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:39.360
If I want to dress in baroque style
I want to dress in baroque style, I'll do it.

390
00:22:39.520 --> 00:22:42.560
I'm reliving my childhood,
which I did not have.

391
00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.720
And at some point you decided,

392
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.360
no longer
to want to be that man.

393
00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:51.960
Well, you're not
you won't be any more anyway.

394
00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:57.080
Gravity and the passage of time
and the passage of time.

395
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.840
When people say:

396
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.640
"After an operation like this, you don't look
you don't look like you used to," I say:

397
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:06.080
"You don't look
you don't look the same either."

398
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.640
They have, it is known,
had a lot done:

399
00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.200
Liposuction, lifting,
injections, Botox.

400
00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:17.120
Why did you do that?
Is it something like a mask?

401
00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.760
No, I wanted
become a different person.

402
00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:23.200
Completely reinvent myself,
a different person.

403
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.880
That went well,
as they say.

404
00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:30.400
You also always say Mr. Glööckler
to himself. - Yes.

405
00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.160
Yes, the Dietrich
said also the Dietrich to itself.

406
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.800
I think,
you have to differentiate.

407
00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.120
I keep my private life
and my ...

408
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.480
and the public person
very different.

409
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.680
Harald would not
come to you on the show.

410
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.280
Have you
done the operations as well,

411
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.400
not to resemble your father?

412
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.360
Yes, in the beginning, maybe.

413
00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.480
But mainly I wanted to
completely distance myself

414
00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:01.440
and give myself
give me a new look.

415
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.400
Then one thing leads to another, you
one day you look in the mirror ...

416
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:10.280
Yes, there were days
where I thought:

417
00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.600
I look like my father,
I don't want that.

418
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:17.080
But so have others,
a friend also has at some point

419
00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:21.080
looked in the mirror and thought
her mother was looking at her.

420
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.520
In the meantime, the topic is through.

421
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:28.520
Do you have to continue these operations
continue until the end of your life?

422
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.960
I don't have to,
I can also leave it alone.

423
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.600
But I intend to
to continue.

424
00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:37.400
But at the moment everything is
in the right place. - Everything dufte.

425
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.520
In India you found out
that you will live to be 100 years old.

426
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.800
Is that good or ...
I want to live to be 100 years old.

427
00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:50.480
I just wanted it confirmed.
I want to become at least 100.

428
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.320
But what do you do with 98?

429
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.440
If you are about to turn 98.
Yes, work.

430
00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.920
Yes? With 100 ... so with 98?

431
00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:04.960
My friend Mrs. Lollobrigida
is 95 and also still working.

432
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.560
She has just made sculptures again
made, travels the world.

433
00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.840
I think that's great.

434
00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.680
The beauty is,
when you have a certain age,

435
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.760
you have a hunting license,
can do what you want.

436
00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:21.480
Then it is always said,
the respect becomes greater and greater

437
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:25.520
and "Don't get him upset."
I think that's good.

438
00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.600
But you don't die either,
You reincarnate.

439
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.360
I'm not sure about that.
I don't want to come again.

440
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.520
Didn't you write that once?
Yes, but I don't feel like it anymore.

441
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.120
Is it possible to turn this off?

442
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.520
Yes, I ask that
that it has an end.

443
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.000
You can try
to arrange everything in life,

444
00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:47.280
that you don't have to do it again.

445
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:52.280
Have you ever been on Earth?
Have you ever been anyone?

446
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:57.120
And if so, who were you? - No,
that's not the point.

447
00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:02.160
I just think ...
We can't grasp that at all.

448
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.920
We do not know, is there
life before death or not?

449
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:11.160
Does yesterday exist at all

450
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.560
or do these times all run
in parallel like in a cinema?

451
00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.960
Runs the rococo at the same time,
not a few hundred years ago?

452
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.160
Unfortunately
our knowledge and our thinking...

453
00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.160
We use
too little capacity of our brain,

454
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.080
that is the problem.

455
00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.080
But I believe that we come into this life with
come into this life with a plan

456
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:36.440
and have a task,
not just to be operated on.

457
00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:40.200
We are spiritual beings who
have a physical experience.

458
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:44.320
I think so,
I am of the same opinion,

459
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.320
that I have been
been in this world before,

460
00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:51.120
not the first time I am there,
I have that feeling.

461
00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.920
Besides, is beside the point,
who I was.

462
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.760
Of course, they all want to be
to be something really great.

463
00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:01.960
No one wants to be poor
or have been a murderer.

464
00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:06.240
Yes, or at the farm ... Kitchen help.
Can also be.

465
00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.080
Maybe we are better off now
better off, or it was better.

466
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.000
You don't know that, yes.

467
00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.160
But now you should
first this life ...

468
00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.600
deal with it
and live that properly

469
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.720
and worry less
what a future one will look like.

470
00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:26.640
That means 100 years of Glööckler
and then closing time.

471
00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.280
If I knew you could get bitten
be bitten by a vampire

472
00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.360
and becomes 300 or 400,
I would do that too.

473
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.240
No, I wouldn't.
Yes, I would. - 90 is enough.

474
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.040
Mr. Glööckler, that's it.
That's it?

475
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.560
Now I have only
really settled in. - Yes?

476
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.560
But had fun with you.
Yes? - Yes.

477
00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.920
I always think:
Are they disturbed now?

478
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.960
No, I enjoyed it.
Yes? - Yes.

479
00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.200
Then we go out now
and say goodbye.

480
00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.880
Come on, I'll give you a ride. Hup.
Are you taking the dog? - Yes.

481
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:02.360
He didn't bite anyone either,
very good. - Where ...

482
00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:05.040
Stand here please ...
This is your desk.

483
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.480
* Krömer clears his throat. *
Like this.

484
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:11.360
How did the dog like it?
Very well, he was quite chilled out.

485
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.080
Does he also have a blog,
that he writes about the show?

486
00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.240
No, but we can still
take a nice selfie.

487
00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:22.080
Yes, of course.
And maybe a video, yes?

488
00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.240
Can I get
get close to the dog? - Yes.
