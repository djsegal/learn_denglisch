00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.160
.

2
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.280
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.440
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.240
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.920
Then let's see what the
Cat put in front of the door today.

6
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.040
Rosa von Praunheim,
79 years old,

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.840
Director, writer and ...

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.560
(sings) ... Holzmichel still.
What? ... Holzmichel still.

9
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.120
Is the old wooden man still alive?
I see. - Yes, he's still alive.

10
00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.600
I thought it was a coupling.
He is not dead yet.

11
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.360
director, author
and gay activist.

12
00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.480
Mr. von Praunheim?
Yes?!

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.040
I am sincerely pleased
that you are here today,

14
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.360
because I've just kind of been interviewing assholes
the last time.

15
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.320
I am glad.
That is nice.

16
00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.280
I hope I do not disappoint
you. - I hope so too.

17
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.480
Should you be an asshole in private
can you cover that up?

18
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.440
No, I can't. - Good.
I'm coming in, I'm happy.

19
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.360
* clears throat

20
00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.880
Moin.
Good morning.

21
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.920
You look good.
Can I give you a hug? - No.

22
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.160
Why? - Well, Corona and stuff.
I see. I'm glad.

23
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.800
One does not know how contagious
you are and your humor.

24
00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.760
Later I will be
as funny as you. - No.

25
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.360
You can't.
You have many things with.

26
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.960
I have written a poem
for you.

27
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.480
Always being funny,
makes you stupid in the long run

28
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.480
and people love the dopes.

29
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.920
It is dangerous
to go out of the house,

30
00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.560
because on the street
all are smart and beautiful.

31
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.160
The comedian has only one choice,
to shoot his audience.

32
00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.320
That's great.
Can I hug you now? - No.

33
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.320
I am not sick.
That's what they all say.

34
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.240
I am being tested after all.

35
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.120
Great that you brought your whole
Playroom with you. - Yes.

36
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.720
You can choose,
what you will be in the next life.

37
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.640
Um, a pug.
Yes, my boyfriend loves pugs.

38
00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.280
You know, they eat their kids,
snoring and shortness of breath and stuff.

39
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.040
Oh, no,
I was already in that life.

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.640
Then I take the octopus.
A good choice.

41
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.680
I will become in the next life
a strawberry frog.

42
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.920
They are small and poisonous.
Yes? - Yes.

43
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.560
Uh-huh.
Good.

44
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.760
They have a great sex life.
The frogs? - Yes.

45
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.000
Don't they fertilize themselves?
Nope, nope.

46
00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.200
Those were snails.
The one on top of the other from behind.

47
00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.880
Snails fuck themselves
and become pregnant from it.

48
00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.920
A bit monotonous, eh?
Yes, exactly.

49
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.400
I have my goat with,
I grew up with it.

50
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.800
Do you have anything at home?
Everything is here.

51
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.800
Yes, it's all there. But I have
500 stuffed animals at home.

52
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.920
All right, shall we get started?
Nope. Oh, yes.

53
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.840
You look great.
You are properly prepared.

54
00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.840
We can exchange the costume.

55
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.560
I had only asses and
happy about you. - Really?

56
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.040
Right-wing asshats.
H. C. Strache, I'm not allowed to say.

57
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.440
But ass is also beautiful.
But not with H. C. Strache.

58
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.120
You were born in 1942
in a prison in Riga.

59
00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.880
Yes. - How did it come about?
I don't know,

60
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.120
because my biological mother
I never got to know.

61
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.000
I then after the death ...

62
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.840
I was then
taken to a hospital in Riga.

63
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.680
Whether my mother voluntarily
or had to give me away?

64
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.720
Anyway, that's where my second
second parents and stole me.

65
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.560
Before the end of the war
they simply took me with them

66
00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.800
- officially adopt did not go -

67
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.720
and enabled me
a wonderful life.

68
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.240
Your adoptive mother did not tell
that you were adopted until you were 94.

69
00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.760
Exactly.
Were you angry with your mother?

70
00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.440
Nah, I was thrilled.

71
00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.480
I am adventurous
and immediately ran to my friend

72
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.720
and said: Great, imagine ...

73
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.200
Then the riddle was,
where do I come from?

74
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:55.200
Am I like Moses in the ...?

75
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.120
In a wicker basket
fished out of the Spree.

76
00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.480
Then I thought, because my second
parents near a concentration camp

77
00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.680
in Riga, maybe a Jewish woman
a Jewish woman put me on the doorstep.

78
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.560
I had many fantasies
and researched

79
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:19.080
and I have been talking about a document, which was
a request for used diapers,

80
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.600
for the foster child,
the foundling Holger Radtke.

81
00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.280
That's when I got
my real name out.

82
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.720
That's your original name? - Yes,
so to speak, and my mother's name.

83
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.960
Did you meet your
your biological parents? - Nope.

84
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.240
Only the demented sister
we have researched.

85
00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.320
And she was already a bit demented.

86
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.480
But the son showed me three photos
of my biological mother.

87
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.320
This was an elegant woman.

88
00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.800
But it must have been
have been difficult,

89
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.760
because she was murdered
murdered after the war

90
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.560
by the same doctors
of psychiatry here in Wittenau

91
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.080
For significant schizophrenia.
Bonhoeffer mental hospital? - Exactly.

92
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.560
They were starving the patients.

93
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.560
The Nazi doctors from the Nazi era
were still there after the war.

94
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.680
We have looked at the files:

95
00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.880
That was every day
so and so many electric shocks.

96
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.400
Then she was
buried in the field.

97
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.360
A doctor had these documents
- that was very touching.

98
00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.240
Rosa von Praunheim
is, after all, a stage name.

99
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.000
How did you come up with the name?

100
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.240
In Frankfurt are
the whole districts

101
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.560
named after any
named after any knightly dynasty.

102
00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.520
There was Wolfram von Praunheim,

103
00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.280
who was very friendly with the son of
Emperor Barbarossa very friendly.

104
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.480
I don't know if they had sex,

105
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.480
but in any case the
made the trading city of Frankfurt great.

106
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.720
Then I thought,
"von Praunheim" is something nice.

107
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:52.120
I like to be noble. You can address me
in the third person.

108
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.000
Your Holiness?
Yes, exactly.

109
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.280
Your haste holiness,
your hasty holiness. - Exactly.

110
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.520
My friend always refuses.
Good that you ...

111
00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.880
That your friend calls you king?

112
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:07.280
All, yes: majesty and reverence
and reverend and subordinate.

113
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.800
Why do you like to talk to people
about their sex life?

114
00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.440
Are you interested in

115
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.760
or do you want to put
in an uncomfortable position?

116
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.640
That's not unpleasant, ...
It is for some people.

117
00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.680
For example, I heard
that you are heterosexual. - Yes.

118
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.800
So I ask, what went wrong
went wrong in your childhood?

119
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.440
Am I ashamed?

120
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.040
No, it could be that
that a mother had a lot of stress...

121
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.000
Aren't you discriminated against in Berlin
so many gays, aren't you discriminated against?

122
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.680
Nope, but also no longer
addressed. Is it due to age?

123
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.320
No, you look good.

124
00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.160
In the past, gays
used to look at me. - I see.

125
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.640
They looked at me
or at the ass.

126
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.240
Now no one is looking.
After all, there is a daddy culture:

127
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.000
The older, the better.
So 'ne "DILF", wa? - Yes.

128
00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.840
I am a "DILF."
Yes.

129
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.040
But no, I mean,
that's a shortcoming, of course.

130
00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.720
If you are heterosexual,
it is expensive.

131
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.400
Why?
It's expensive to be heterosexual.

132
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:04.960
Why?
Well, women and children.

133
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.480
And if you have a mistress,
Divorce and all.

134
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.440
It's all difficult.
Now that you mention it.

135
00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.320
You throw your money
out of the window. - Yes.

136
00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.800
I sweat.
Are you sweating too? - Nope.

137
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:19.920
Can I hug you?
That is out of the question.

138
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.960
My boyfriend is jealous.

139
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.800
May I kiss the signet ring,
Mr. King?

140
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.040
No, but I'll show you a picture,
which I have just painted.

141
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.120
"Männerpuff in Augsburg" is the name of it.
Cool.

142
00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:37.320
I have a big exhibition on
November 11 at the gallery "Moon".

143
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.560
When is this going to air? Not,
that the vernissage is over.

144
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.680
It goes until December 11. - Okay.
Look, there are cameras everywhere.

145
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:49.200
Where do I put this?
Never mind, we'll catch it all.

146
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.320
"Men's whorehouse in ...
You don't see any peckers at all.

147
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.120
You don't see any peckers?
True.

148
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:57.960
Now that you mention it, yes.
What's wrong with you?

149
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.840
I showed my urologist
my calendar:

150
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.520
This is an exhibition,
that I have ...

151
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.200
There are a lot of peckers.

152
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.240
... an exhibition
in Munich from November 3.

153
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:11.360
Since the urologist
immediately aufgez...

154
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:13.760
Ah, here's a pecker.
'Ne?!

155
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.960
Yes. Yes.

156
00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.640
War and Peace.

157
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:20.880
I would in between
ask a few questions.

158
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:24.480
Yes, but I also wrote
my book "Rabbit Poopie Hole".

159
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:29.200
But also no dick on it.
Yes. - What's wrong, Rosa?

160
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.080
Well, so without a dick ...
Anyway, a friend said:

161
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.440
"Rabbit Putin Hole" would be better.
Yes, that would be a blast.

162
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:41.320
In the book 3 older women dispose
the dictators of this world.

163
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.320
Welcome to QVC.
Our guest, Rosa von Praunheim,

164
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.520
has today
its entire product range with it.

165
00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.640
I also have "Rosa Theater
published by Fischer, 4 plays by me.

166
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.880
Also beautiful.
Just is in Moers ...

167
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.560
Do you have t-shirts and sweaters,
that you ...?

168
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.800
Nah, I just have the strawberry frog
and the pug you want to be.

169
00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.120
Tell me, a fortune teller once predicted
once predicted the date of your death.

170
00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:11.920
Exactly. - Next year in October.
October 16, 2023.

171
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.760
When did she tell you that?

172
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:20.320
She said a few years ago,
just before my 81st birthday, I would...

173
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.160
Is she stupid?
You don't do that.

174
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.800
A few years ago?

175
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.120
Now you always think about 10/16?
I'm really looking forward to it. - No.

176
00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.800
But maybe
the fortune teller dies.

177
00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:35.200
Maybe she dies on the 16th.
That happened to me once.

178
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.960
Someone said to me:
"You'll die in five years."

179
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.720
After 5 years, she said:
"No, that was ..."

180
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.680
A week later she was dead.

181
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.520
Don't you get depressed
with a death date?

182
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:48.320
The worst knowledge.
No, this is beautiful.

183
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.920
I have enough.
I made 150 films.

184
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.960
My boyfriend, of course,
that I live to be 100.

185
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.280
This is a cruel idea.

186
00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:00.040
Is it more difficult for gay people
to grow older?

187
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.000
I have a wonderful friend
for 15 years.

188
00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:10.320
When I was 65, he called me and
said he had a crush on me.

189
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.840
Then I thought he was gerontophilic.

190
00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.800
What does that mean?
Only like older people. - Ah, DILF.

191
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.280
Older ones who already have baggy skin
have or so,

192
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:22.040
that he thinks that's hot.

193
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:25.960
But he means, no, he has
really fallen in love with me.

194
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.120
Yes, for 15 years
we are happy together.

195
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.720
It's a really great relationship.
Running.

196
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.600
May I say my favorite movie
of yours?

197
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.480
Yes, please. - "The Bed Sausage."
Oh, very nice.

198
00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:40.160
Shall we take a look at an excerpt?
Gladly.

199
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.880
I love you incredibly.
Luzi, you are everything to me.

200
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.200
I love you, Luzi,
I love you incredibly.

201
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.200
It was love at first sight
and you shall always stay with me.

202
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.840
You must always remain as you are today.
Luzi, I never want to lose you.

203
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.520
I love you. - You are
the first woman I love like this.

204
00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:05.680
Luzi, the first woman, your hair
and everything, your bosom and everything.

205
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.320
I love the movie.
You can identify with it.

206
00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.280
You have a love life like that too?
You yell at your wife?

207
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.280
Yes, I am just as attached to the bed.

208
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.120
At that time I played at the Schaubühne
and invited the colleagues

209
00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.960
to the video evening
and turned on the bed sausage.

210
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.840
There were 10 people and at the end
only Matthias Matschke,

211
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.600
my best friend today.

212
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.000
The others were disturbed.
I love the film to this day.

213
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.160
Mr. Stein called me
and was also enthusiastic,

214
00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.960
but I made a musical out of it.
I know.

215
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:42.200
In the "Bar of any reason", comes
again in February, a huge success.

216
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.600
Are we still transmitting there?
There is so much going on here,

217
00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.880
I don't know if in February
the rbb still exists.

218
00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.040
Not even an executive floor anymore ...

219
00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:54.240
But when the scandal comes out
that you're locking up guests here.

220
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.120
And there are now
some have already disappeared.

221
00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.760
Yes, rightly so.

222
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.800
This is worse
than the Intendanten scandal.

223
00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.360
With the film
you made your aunt Luzie

224
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:07.440
and the hustler Dietmar Kracht
to actors.

225
00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:11.120
Was that a stylistic device or did you
you no money for the film

226
00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:14.480
and then your aunt stepped in?
I loved my aunt.

227
00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:18.440
I met my aunt when I was
when I was 14 years old in Praunheim.

228
00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.480
It came from Poland,
was visiting from Poland

229
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.760
and had a shrill voice,
colorful clothes,

230
00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.640
was incredibly funny
and imaginative.

231
00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.840
I thought I wanted to
put on the stage.

232
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.760
I think it's so funny that you can tell..,
that neither of them are actors.

233
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.280
You can say that.
That was the beauty ...

234
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:39.920
The dilettante ...

235
00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.680
Well, the nice thing that they did not
so artificially selected spoke.

236
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.560
Yes. - That they were natural,
with an incredible amount of imagination.

237
00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:51.400
And they were authentic.

238
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:55.040
Although he was gay,
they were lovers.

239
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.280
Yes, and they sort of parody
your heterosexual life.

240
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:01.400
My life?
Yes, they parody.

241
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.680
Too bad, that's a shitty life.

242
00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.040
But you discovered a lot of people.

243
00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:09.880
Also Lotti Huber, Evelyn Künneke,
Charlotte von Mahlsdorf.

244
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.240
How did you get close to people?

245
00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:16.280
Lotti Huber, for example, was the queen of the
of the extras in Berlin.

246
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.720
The one at Zauberberg, everywhere
she sat in small extra roles.

247
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.400
I heard from her

248
00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.880
and have them in my film
"Our corpses are still alive" 1981 ...

249
00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:31.960
I know everything.
That was a huge success.

250
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:35.840
Then Lotti said: "You don't need
the other 4 women at all,

251
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.960
go on with me alone."
This is what I have done

252
00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:40.640
- 4 other movies with her.

253
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.040
The only time
that I wrote to a celebrity,

254
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.080
was Lotti Huber back then.
Beautiful.

255
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:48.680
I said:
"I would like you to be my grandma."

256
00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:52.800
And the wrote back. - Great.
"I'm sure your grandma is good too."

257
00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:56.200
With your film
"It is not the homosexual who is perverted,

258
00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.680
but the situation,
in which he lives"

259
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.800
you caused a stir in the 70s
you caused quite a stir.

260
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.440
We'll have a look ...

261
00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.320
Different opinions about,
whether the topic of homosexuality,

262
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.480
so openly and publicly
could treat.

263
00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.680
We should ask normal homosexuals
ask them,

264
00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:18.240
what it cost them,
to seem as normal as they do.

265
00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.840
But this film is m.E.,
seen under this aspect,

266
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.360
nothing else
than adolescent shock therapy.

267
00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.520
I would be pleased if it
to a greater understanding

268
00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:33.040
for minorities who are different.

269
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:35.520
Say,
what is different about us?

270
00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.400
Please say that specifically.

271
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.920
Excuse me
Homosexuality and heterosexuality

272
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:46.240
is different, just like blonde
and black hair, it's clear.

273
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.840
Where?
What is different there?

274
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:54.960
Yes, there was something going on.
Why was this discussion so big?

275
00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.840
First, the film was banned
by the ARD.

276
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.040
In 1971 it was to be
be shown in the first program,

277
00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.840
then they banned him.

278
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.960
Then there was a huge press campaign
for the film.

279
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.960
Only WDR showed it locally in 1972

280
00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.640
and in 1973 it was
shown with discussions.

281
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.680
That was the discussion afterwards.

282
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.360
That was a street sweeper back then,
there were only 3 programs.

283
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.680
We founded with the film
over 50 gay groups.

284
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.160
Even in the GDR they saw the
and they got together

285
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.120
until the Stasi broke the
broke them apart again.

286
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.640
That was, so to speak, the initiative
of the new German gay movement

287
00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:35.280
and there was a lot going on.

288
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.800
Is that what started the queer movement
in Germany back then?

289
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.440
Yes, I mean,
they already existed in the past.

290
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:46.040
There is my film about the sex
scientist Magnus Hirschfeld,

291
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:50.040
who already in 1897
founded the first gay group.

292
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:54.000
Who had a large library
about gay life,

293
00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.000
that the Nazis destroyed.
Exactly, in the 20s.

294
00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:02.880
Then the Nazis came and destroyed
everything and he had to go abroad.

295
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.080
Gay and Jewish,
that was a bit too much.

296
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.720
Even after the war
he was not taken so seriously,

297
00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.840
because he had such biologistic theses
at that time.

298
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.240
Only then did we realize what a
what a great person he was.

299
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.520
Were you about rioting
or about homosexuality?

300
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:28.000
Well, I'm gay myself
and I grew up in the 50s.

301
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:32.000
I was very disappointed
by the gays that I ...

302
00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.920
You had to ring
and night bar and secretly etc.

303
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:39.120
I was young, wild and artist

304
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.800
and thought,
I must make friends,

305
00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.280
who do something for the emancipation
advocacy. That was very difficult.

306
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.480
All were very afraid
and this anger so to speak

307
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.960
on my gay friends,
I expressed in the film

308
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.920
and said: Not only
you in glamour magazines

309
00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:00.240
and movie stars,
but do something, become open

310
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.400
and show your homosexuality.

311
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:04.160
That was a huge shock.

312
00:17:04.320 --> 00:17:06.760
What would you have to
shoot for a film today,

313
00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:09.080
to start such a wave
to start such a wave again?

314
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.280
Well, that is very difficult,
but there are many...

315
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.480
The film would have to be
shoot in Russia of course

316
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.280
or in China or Africa.

317
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:20.640
Or in Iran,
where there is a death penalty.

318
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:25.360
There the gay man is hanged just like
as the one who fucks a goat.

319
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.760
It is still in many countries ...

320
00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.800
Now again in America,
Florida, who want to ban,

321
00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:37.080
that there's the word "gay"
is in the school books and stuff.

322
00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:39.400
We have to keep fighting.

323
00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.920
What do you teach your students
at the film school?

324
00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:47.320
How to make movies
or attract attention?

325
00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:55.800
In our house, where I live,
there was a sado-maso club for a very long time.

326
00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.560
Tina did that and she invited
me more often, I could watch.

327
00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.880
Then I took
my students there and said:

328
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:08.960
You will have to suffer a lot
as film directors,

329
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.400
so tries
to suffer cheerfully.

330
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.520
Then they made the session with
with the dominatrix?

331
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.360
Nah, but that showed them:

332
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.200
Nailing cross, nailing testicles,
gynecological chair, etc.

333
00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:24.440
They were shocked and then had to
then write in my apartment.

334
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.920
Most students have a high school diploma
and then you have no more feelings,

335
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:31.240
you are scientifically educated.

336
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.480
And film is not thoughts in
pictures, but feelings in pictures.

337
00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.200
You have to be able to
be able to feel every scene.

338
00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.400
Do you have a high school diploma? - Nope.
That's an advantage.

339
00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.920
That's why I feel so much.
Yes, just.

340
00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.760
This is the first time I've heard that.

341
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.840
The next student story
was Charite, autopsy.

342
00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.480
They also had to ...?

343
00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:55.680
They had to see
how a corpse is dismembered.

344
00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:59.000
They came out green and blue,
had to write again.

345
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:03.280
It was still emotional for 10 minutes,
then they started thinking again.

346
00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.880
Did they become something?
Yes, they are famous people.

347
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.720
They have made a wonderful film
"Rosa's Children".

348
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.920
It has become very significant.

349
00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:15.800
Tom Tykwer, Chris Kraus,
Julia von Heinz, etc.

350
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.880
In 1991 you sat in the hot seat
on the hot seat. - Yes.

351
00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:21.760
Almost like today here

352
00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:25.640
and there you have outed Alfred Biolek
and Hape Kerkeling.

353
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.280
We'll take a look.

354
00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.480
Look at bio, he is very popular
and tomorrow again on the channel.

355
00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:34.240
Why can't he say:
I am gay?

356
00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:37.680
For example, Hape Kerkeling
would have a role model function.

357
00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:40.520
He's young, handsome,
a likeable guy.

358
00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:46.040
I asked him on the phone yesterday:
Would you make yourself public?

359
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:50.680
Then he said to me, "Yes, not now.
but maybe later."

360
00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:55.240
That was during the time,
when a very good friend of mine,

361
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.920
an activist, AIDS activist,
had died of AIDS.

362
00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.960
I made five films on the subject
and very many actions,

363
00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:07.760
to save people,
to practice safe sex.

364
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:12.480
After I thought,
I must throw a stone.

365
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.880
I have to ask celebrities
to be in solidarity.

366
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.040
A few years later
Hape Kerkeling and Biolek

367
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.640
also positive and said,
they feel much more liberated.

368
00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.160
It did not harm them,
on the contrary.

369
00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:30.000
That was where I met you
and I hated you. - Yes.

370
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.280
I was a big fan of Kerkeling,
I used to watch it and think:

371
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.920
There is a strange man
who is now hurting him publicly.

372
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.440
That's what came to me. - But
he made all the more career.

373
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.400
After all, that didn't hurt either of them.

374
00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.600
It did me more harm than good,
because everyone hated me.

375
00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:48.640
Are you sorry about that in hindsight?

376
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:51.480
Nah, I think
politically, that was important.

377
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:53.800
Like now with the climate activists.

378
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:58.120
They do things where everyone gets angry,
but there is an attention.

379
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:02.920
Could you still blackmail someone today
with his homosexuality?

380
00:21:03.080 --> 00:21:04.560
Björn Höcke or something?

381
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:12.440
Certainly, there are quite a number of
people who live very hidden.

382
00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:15.960
They think,
the image as a movie star or ...

383
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:19.960
But now there are enough examples,
thank God, like Wowereit,

384
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.080
who is wonderful
and who has not been harmed by this

385
00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.560
and others neither.
That's what I mean.

386
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.600
If I say politician XY
is gay, I'll out him now,

387
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.320
that nothing
nothing negative results.

388
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.640
I would like to tell,
who is gay in celebrities,

389
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.960
but that has forbidden me
my boyfriend forbade.

390
00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.080
But there are.
There are, yes.

391
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.200
Bundesliga, I would say.
Well, not only.

392
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.840
Church. - Why are you not
gay? Do you have an explanation?

393
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.440
I do not know.
Is a nicer life.

394
00:21:50.600 --> 00:21:53.200
I can still become one.
Yes, geriatric.

395
00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:56.440
What is age gay?
When you realize in old age ...

396
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.840
People with families, four children, etc.
suddenly say:

397
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.080
I have always been interested.

398
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.040
And now I would like to ...,
the children are big.

399
00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:06.720
That's what Wolfgang Joop said:

400
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.960
"When the kids were out of the house,
I was gay."

401
00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.840
He was gay before.

402
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.080
He turned me on once,
but he wasn't my type. - No?

403
00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.920
Nah. He's funny, smart.
No gossip today.

404
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:19.560
Great guy, but ...

405
00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.880
Maybe I'm going senile,
can be.

406
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.560
How is it that soccer
is such a gay sport

407
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.560
and no one is openly gay?

408
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.760
They hug each other all the time,
grabbing each other's butts,

409
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.920
swap jerseys,
jump on a pile. - Yes.

410
00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.000
Actually gay,
but not gay.

411
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:42.960
You, all men are gay.
That's just the way it is.

412
00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.040
When they're drinking and stuff,
they also lie in each other's arms,

413
00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.760
so Honecker and Gorbachev.
Yes, yes.

414
00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.520
Or what was his name back then?
They also kissed each other.

415
00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:57.720
No, we are all
gay and lesbian.

416
00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.080
The beauty is,
that we all have these facilities.

417
00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.000
You also have
a strong feminine side.

418
00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:07.760
I'm wearing silk stockings today.
Wonderful, wonderful.

419
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.680
Wow! - Isn't that beautiful?
Very beautiful.

420
00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.520
Are you wearing women's underwear?
Not today.

421
00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.280
Not today?
Not today.

422
00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.400
What would happen if in the
Bundesliga with us are 5 gays

423
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.800
and we would say:
He is gay.

424
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:25.320
Would there be no more soccer?
Would it be banned?

425
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.080
So Hitzlsperger has come out of the closet.
After his career.

426
00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:33.320
After his career. There are
others after the career, too.

427
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.000
That will come eventually.

428
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.520
It all takes time.

429
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.720
What do you say to people,
who say about gays:

430
00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:44.160
That's enough now,
let them be quiet.

431
00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.000
They can get married now
and now that's enough.

432
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.000
I say it is still
still hard for young people,

433
00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:51.840
at school, for example, teenagers.

434
00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Especially with a mixed bunch
of people from many countries,

435
00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.360
who have learned culturally,
gays are horrible.

436
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:03.440
Then it is very difficult for teachers and students
very difficult to come out.

437
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:07.000
Do teenagers,
let's say a 15-year-old,

438
00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.240
still stuck today,
being gay is not okay.

439
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.840
Especially during puberty
gay/lesbian is disgusting for many.

440
00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.880
That is not part of the majority.

441
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.400
As a young person, you want to be part of the
not be a minority.

442
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.840
It's very brave,
when you are so young,

443
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.960
to confidently say: I am different
different, I stand by it and I'm proud.

444
00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.600
This is very difficult.

445
00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:31.600
What is your
to today's queer activism?

446
00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:36.280
Being gay has meanwhile become
L-G-B-T-Q-I-A+ has become.

447
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:37.920
Are you still coming?

448
00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.400
Yes, I am of course
an old white man and many things.

449
00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.800
My friend then corrects me:
"Now you said shit."

450
00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:49.320
He is very afraid
that I'm saying something wrong here.

451
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.280
What are you supposed to say wrong?

452
00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:54.160
Well, I'm
not the smartest either.

453
00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.000
You don't have a high school diploma either? - Nope.
No? Then you can feel.

454
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:01.200
I stayed three times
and before the Mittlere Reife

455
00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.240
and still became a professor.

456
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:07.400
I did not remain seated, then I am
the gifted one here. - Yes.

457
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.280
Your latest film is a docudrama
about the life of Rex Gildo,

458
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.680
who had to keep his relationship with his manager
had to keep secret all his life.

459
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.320
Excerpt:

460
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.240
I am always nice,

461
00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:23.200
especially to you.

462
00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:25.720
Yes, here at home.

463
00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.640
But out in public
you have to play the ladies' man.

464
00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:34.840
Understood.

465
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.200
Yippee-ki-yay.

466
00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:42.960
Yes, my little one, I love you.
I love you too.

467
00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:47.200
What a beautiful cowboy.
Thank you.

468
00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.040
Hop, hop, rider.
Uh-uh.

469
00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.120
Many say,
this is Ben Becker's best role.

470
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.160
Now we come to the scandal.

471
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.200
Now I get the rabbit
out of the cylinder.

472
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.040
Now I'll out Ben Becker.
Is he straight?

473
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.920
Yes.
He is not gay at all.

474
00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:07.600
I saw him at the Ku'damm, how he kissed
kissed a woman on the mouth.

475
00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:11.040
Yes, it is a scandal
and that in public.

476
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.680
So, I mean ...

477
00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:18.080
Do you understand when people criticize
that heterosexuals play gay?

478
00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:20.600
Young activists in particular demand,

479
00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:24.440
gay roles only by
to cast gay actors.

480
00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:28.120
Yes, and murderers must
be played by real murderers.

481
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.000
That would be good, too. - Do you understand
Do you understand that, or is that silly?

482
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.640
He played it well.

483
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:37.480
An actor is an actor,
he must be able to do many things.

484
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.400
This is his training.

485
00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:42.080
And no, that's a bit of an exaggeration.

486
00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.920
I am happy when ...

487
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.240
Gays are afraid to play gay
play because they are set

488
00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:51.280
and say:
Then you always have to play gay.

489
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:53.600
Unfortunately, that's the way it is in the industry.

490
00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.480
Do you have any intelligent questions?

491
00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.920
Were all put.

492
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:03.920
Oh yeah, good. - Was it bad?
Did you talk shit? Nope.

493
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.280
My friend will read
read me the riot act afterwards

494
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:09.720
and then it becomes
a bad night.

495
00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:13.400
Because if you are a little
incorrect, say anything,

496
00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:16.280
entire careers can be
can go down the drain.

497
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:19.960
A dangerous time,
but we were like that in the '68s, too.

498
00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.920
That was it already. - Yes.
We're done. - Well, too bad.

499
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.800
Can I hug you now?

500
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.040
In the next life
you may embrace me.

501
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.080
You didn't offer me a drink.
Do you want a drink?

502
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:37.000
No, it's poisoned.
Why? I drink from it myself.

503
00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.400
Come on, let's go outside,
we'll do the goodbyes.

504
00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.040
Unfortunately, it is already over.

505
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.600
Yes.
Whoops.

506
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.040
We are still saying goodbye.

507
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.080
We can sing a Christmas carol
sing, after all, it's almost Christmas.

508
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.320
I've been meaning to say that ...
# Oh, you merry

509
00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:02.440
(both) # Oh blessed

510
00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.400
... Christmas time.

511
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:07.440
You can see that we have
no school education,

512
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.480
we can only the first verse.

513
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.600
So, I'm getting old gay.
Yes.

514
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:15.120
Are we already placing ads,
that people can call in?

515
00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.720
Of course. - Do I take
an older or younger man?

516
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.080
I made a play: A
79-year-old woman could not sleep

517
00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.000
and masturbated
always with the garden shovel.

518
00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:29.320
The doctor: "No sleeping pills,
a lover."

519
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.640
Then she put out an ad
and hundreds applied.

520
00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.200
The thing with the garden shovel
I would leave out,

521
00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.880
but otherwise
I am open for a lot.

522
00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:44.560
I like to wear silk stockings
and buy ladies underwear tomorrow.

523
00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.240
Women's underwear?
Didn't you ask?

524
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.120
What color?
Black.

525
00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.160
I see. - Makes so nice and thin.
Yes, that's right.

526
00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.560
Do you have another product?
How? - A book or something?

527
00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.320
I have many products.
We have the whole range through.

528
00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:02.720
I am very productive.
We are very close: hug?

529
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:04.560
No, in the next life.

530
00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:08.800
In the next life, I don't know
whether we'll still be on the air,

531
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.440
but then I embrace
Rosa von Praunheim.

532
00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:14.200
That was it.
Take care, neighbors.

533
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:17.480
# Oh, you merry

534
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.880
(Charles Aznavour inserts)
# Oh, you blessed

535
00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:26.600
# Graceful
(both) Christmas time

536
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.720
Now you can hug me.

537
00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:31.840
# You are the one for me, for me

538
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:34.600
# For me, formidable

539
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.320
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

540
00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.480
