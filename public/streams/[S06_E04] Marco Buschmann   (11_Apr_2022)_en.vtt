00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
.

2
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.080
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:05.520
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.400
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.200
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.520
Marco Buschmann,
44 years, member of the FDP,

7
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.880
DJ, Trekkie
and Federal Minister of Justice.

8
00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.960
Mr. Minister of Justice?
Yes?

9
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.880
What is that feeling,

10
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.720
to sit on the other side
of the law?

11
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680
So I feel I'm in the right,
no matter where I sit at the table.

12
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.400
I would come in, yes?
Very well. I am glad.

13
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.200
* (clears throat)

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.680
Hello, Mr. Buschmann.
Hello.

15
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.720
Uh... Good evening.

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.360
We only have half an hour
time, you know that.

17
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.000
Okay, I think that's good.
Have you seen the format yet?

18
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:08.080
I have watched the episode
with Gregor Gysi. - And?

19
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.520
Yes ... was special.
How special?

20
00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.000
Particularly crappy? Especially good?
No, so unusual.

21
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.560
Why? - The flow
didn't come in, did it?

22
00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.360
Yes, it's always up to the guest:

23
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.240
If he is poorly prepared,
we'll be in trouble. - Oh dear.

24
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.800
But you know,
it's all about Remmidemmi here.

25
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.840
Riot and Remmidemmi?
Riot.

26
00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.120
People want ruckus

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.040
and that I verbally
verbally hospitalized.

28
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.960
And then you invite
a paper clip like me?

29
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.920
Would you say that?
Yes ...

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.320
Can I write in my beauty blog
write "paper clip"?

31
00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.960
Yes, if you
get the impression ...

32
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.360
Lawyers are generally regarded
as sober, controlled.

33
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.920
Did you arrive sober today?

34
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.800
I don't drink a drop of alcohol.
No? - Neither do you, ne?

35
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.440
No, I have been a dry alcoholic
for eleven years. Are you?

36
00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.120
I have
skipped this alcohol phase.

37
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.840
But maybe it will come.

38
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.120
A drug career.
True, anyone can get sick.

39
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.880
That's right. So, let's get started.
What do you actually do for a living?

40
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.880
Do you write all the laws yourself?
Are you the secret chancellor?

41
00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.640
No, for God's sake.

42
00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.120
I have
really great employees

43
00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.520
and am just
the Federal Minister of Justice.

44
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.480
I have to make sure
that the overall result is then correct.

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.080
No more?
That's already a lot.

46
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.520
You not only have to prepare something with the
prepare something with the employees ...

47
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.240
Don't answer for too long.
Oh, I find that difficult.

48
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.040
Short sentences. - That's difficult for me.
Otherwise we'll start to flounder.

49
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.720
But again briefly the answer.
Yes, there is already a lot to do.

50
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.440
Well, if we agree
agree on the measure of sentences,

51
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.920
I can ask the questions longer
and you answer shorter.

52
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.240
Then I also learn something.
Um...

53
00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.080
Since the election campaign, you've been talking only
about progressive projects:

54
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.320
Cannabis, no so-called
ban on abortion advertising, etc.

55
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.200
Do you reap there
laurels from the Greens and the SPD?

56
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.280
No, not at all. These are things
that the FDP has in its program,

57
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.640
because we
are a progressive party.

58
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.520
But the Greens also had that
in their program, didn't they? The SPD, too.

59
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.160
Yes, but that's... - Looks like..,
like you made it up.

60
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.800
No, these are positions that I
believe to be correct, and so do others.

61
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.280
I am happy about that,
This gives them majorities

62
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.440
and I get them
in the Federal Law Gazette. Cannabis ...

63
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.320
Short answers, please.
I just want to say one thing. - Only one thing.

64
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.240
I do not want
adorn myself with borrowed plumes.

65
00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.280
Health Minister Karl Lauterbach is responsible for cannabis.
Karl Lauterbach is responsible for cannabis.

66
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.000
Do you have anything to smoke?
No. - Okay.

67
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.320
Um... You want to initiate a major
family law reform.

68
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.800
In addition to marriage, there should be a
community of responsibility.

69
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.280
What is it,
Community of responsibility?

70
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.360
Now it becomes difficult
with the short answers.

71
00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.960
This is hard now,
but you're going to have to...

72
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.960
We don't live in the 50s anymore.

73
00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.880
We have gay couples,
lesbian couples, old people's shared flats,

74
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.080
where people help
help each other.

75
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.040
They have certain problems
in everyday life because our family law

76
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.160
only marriage, adoption and
recognition of paternity.

77
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.760
When older people get together,
to help each other, for example ...

78
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.800
They don't want to get married,
but live together

79
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.560
and when one gets sick,
visit each other in the hospital.

80
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.240
That's what it's good for.

81
00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160
Or single parents,
who do not want to get married,

82
00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.720
but help each other
help with child rearing.

83
00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.440
Since that is a good thing
in a more modern,

84
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.880
changed society today.

85
00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.640
Are you really concerned about

86
00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.360
or is the FDP only concerned
only about inheritance tax?

87
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.680
That I can tell you now,
you belong to my ...

88
00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.440
They belong to me, we enter
that in and then you can inherit.

89
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.200
No, I personally
am of the opinion

90
00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.000
that you do not have to
with the tax,

91
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.200
because people who, for example
help each other in old age ...

92
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.920
In old age one has
rather lower income

93
00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.440
and also single parents
usually do not have so much money,

94
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.000
therefore you do not have to
not have to turn the tax so much.

95
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.120
I'm not the driving force here.
I don't want a tax savings box.

96
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.440
Are we already
in an argument?

97
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.480
No, you asked a smart question
and I'm trying to...

98
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.560
Smart doesn't help us.
We have to make a fuss.

99
00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.440
We can do everything,
but without hitting.

100
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.320
No, hitting is forbidden.

101
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.760
Aren't you the thug type?
No.

102
00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.200
Neither do I.
That's why I prefer verbal.

103
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.960
If you hit me,
I might fall down.

104
00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.800
I would never punch you.
What? You want to smack me?

105
00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.960
No, I would never
I would never hit anyone. - Oh, good.

106
00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.520
Is there anyone,
you'd like to punch?

107
00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.080
Everyone has had that thought,
but you don't do that.

108
00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.720
But you are allowed to think it.
Exactly, because thoughts are free.

109
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.440
One may wish:

110
00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.920
He should get one.
It doesn't have to be from me.

111
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.720
Exactly, as long as it stays in your head,
it's okay.

112
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.520
Can this also be in my beauty blog:
"If it stays in your head: okay."?

113
00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.880
Yeah, sure.
After all, I'm not hurting anyone with it.

114
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.240
Back to this
Responsibility Community Act.

115
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.200
Communities of responsibility
should also be possible in threes.

116
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.560
Do you want to bring the traffic light coalition into the
Private households? * Laughter *

117
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.600
No,
it's not about the traffic lights.

118
00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.960
An old people's flat share can also
consist of three or four people.

119
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.280
Why should they not be able to
be able to cover each other?

120
00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.200
Therefore, for more than two people.
It is something different from marriage.

121
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.520
People always have
these two-way relationships in their heads,

122
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.080
but that is something else.

123
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.600
A community.
Exactly, a shared apartment, for example

124
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.520
They promised the end of the Corona
measures half a year ago.

125
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.680
No, that's not true.

126
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.080
An absolute end to all measures,
and all measures

127
00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.440
end at the latest with the
the beginning of spring on March 20, 2022.

128
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.920
Thank you for ... - You said that
said on October 27, 2021.

129
00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.920
Can you also
predict the lottery numbers?

130
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:26.720
No, but good,
that you are recording this.

131
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.200
Many show only this one sentence.
Yes.

132
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.400
But I introduced at that time
presented the legislative package,

133
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:35.000
that was limited in time.

134
00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.520
Therefore, the sentence was correct,
to say

135
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.640
In this legislative package
the measures end on this date.

136
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.200
However, I said two,
three sentences later,

137
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.360
if you watch the
watch in full on YouTube:

138
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.120
When the situation changes,

139
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.080
then came the delta wave,
or a new virus variant comes,

140
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.760
then you can
react to the situation.

141
00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:58.480
My topic
is acting in accordance with the situation.

142
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.240
If the situation becomes more controllable,
measures must be withdrawn.

143
00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.760
If the situation becomes more dangerous,
you have to react with measures.

144
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.440
The health ministers of the states
would like to see the old rules

145
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.760
and Lauterbach warns of the fall.

146
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:15.680
We must
continue in the fight against Corona.

147
00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.520
There is no Freedom Day,

148
00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:19.560
no reason to slack off here.

149
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:23.480
The way out of the pandemic
is universal compulsory vaccination.

150
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.000
With the vaccination gap,
that we have now,

151
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:30.400
we will have the same debate in the fall
debate as we are having now.

152
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.840
Do you and Lauterbach
talk to each other?

153
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.600
Yes, even a lot and very successfully.

154
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:41.600
The last change
of the Infection Protection Act

155
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.360
we worked out together.
But he said something different.

156
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:49.440
Contradictory almost.
Yes, many believe that.

157
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.520
We were ...
Sounded like this.

158
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.120
That was about something else:
the compulsory vaccination.

159
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.800
Two sentences later, does he say
something completely different?

160
00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:00.160
No, he has
spoke on compulsory vaccination.

161
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.280
The IfSG
is not about compulsory vaccination,

162
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.200
so not in the package,
that we have negotiated.

163
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.120
It is about these so-called
Corona protection measures,

164
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.600
that we have made a million times
made rightly for many months.

165
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.320
But we now have stable
conditions in the hospitals,

166
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:19.840
so that people are
more normality should be made possible.

167
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.520
Wouldn't it be your job,

168
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.520
a legislative proposal
to make vaccination compulsory?

169
00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.000
Um... No, because we agreed
agreed on this,

170
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.120
that such a
medical ethical question ...

171
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.240
Now everyone can vote.
That's good, that's democracy.

172
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:36.960
It's good,
when we say,

173
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:39.760
there is a topic,
that is so ethically significant ...

174
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.760
After all, this is not the first time.

175
00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.240
On the subject of abortion, euthanasia
we have reached an agreement in parliament.

176
00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:50.200
In Austria, they have
abolished compulsory vaccination again.

177
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.720
Yes ...
And we're still voting? - Yes.

178
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.120
They wait for it,
until everyone has forgotten.

179
00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:01.200
Then you show little kittens
and everyone is distracted again.

180
00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.560
I don't have any cat content
on my social media.

181
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.320
You can borrow it.
Yes ...

182
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.800
Your deputy
Party Chairman Wolfgang Kubicki

183
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.760
is not a friend of compulsory vaccination
and was secretly boozing in the lockdown.

184
00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.480
I admit, we also had
here in Strande, as in every place,

185
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.680
Prohibition cellars, i.e. pubs,
that were open anyway.

186
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.400
Did you go in?
Yes, of course.

187
00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.840
We have
not a single case in Strande.

188
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.000
Yes ... - How many lateral thinkers
are there in the FDP?

189
00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.520
Wolfgang Kubicki
has a mind of his own.

190
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.240
But he is not a lateral thinker,

191
00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.080
he accepts
scientific facts.

192
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:40.960
But he draws different conclusions.

193
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.800
He was in every cellar in Strande
and has tweeted himself one.

194
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.320
For scientific reasons?
No.

195
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:51.520
But lateral thinkers are people
who say that the virus does not exist.

196
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:55.400
Wolfgang Kubicki was the first
who wore FFP2 mask in the Bundestag.

197
00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.360
There was
the duty did not yet exist.

198
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.920
He said:
"I don't want to get sick."

199
00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:04.320
Then he came to the assessment,
that the danger level is low.

200
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.320
Still, that's not okay.

201
00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.920
Law and order
also apply to members of parliament,

202
00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.600
also for the Vice President
of the Bundestag.

203
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.760
The Bundeswehr
is to receive 100 billion more.

204
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.320
Now Lindner
incurred so many debts.

205
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.400
What did I vote for the FDP for?

206
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.160
Because we still have solid finances
have, there is no tax increase.

207
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:27.680
And above all, this money is ...
There is no tax increase?

208
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.480
No. - Nothing at all?
Not with the FDP. - VAT?

209
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:34.320
No. Why should the
be increased? - Never?

210
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.600
So in 100,
50 or 20 years, I don't know,

211
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.480
but anyway ...

212
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:43.600
It's "never say never",
but for all we know...

213
00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.520
For the next 100 years
No tax increase?

214
00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.480
In this legislative period,
as long as the FDP is in government.

215
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.960
Legislative period
does not last 100 years.

216
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.520
The additional money is even to be
even be enshrined in the Basic Law.

217
00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.880
Can we do that right now?
I have...

218
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.760
Ha.
The Basic Law.

219
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:07.200
That you as Minister of Justice
write this right here?

220
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:11.560
Yes ... - Where do we put it?
In Article 109: Debt brake?

221
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.840
Or Article 115a: Procurement of credit
in case of defense?

222
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.280
It is
Thank God it's not like that,

223
00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:21.240
that one person in the government
can change that.

224
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.480
You are the Minister of Justice.
I act accordingly.

225
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.840
You're the minister of justice, aren't you?
who can say: We are changing that.

226
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.880
Then take the book with you.

227
00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:33.920
I serve the basic law,
you can only change it,

228
00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:36.720
when in the Bundestag and the Bundesrat

229
00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.480
at least two thirds
of the members vote in favor.

230
00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.920
That is also a good thing,
because it means that the Basic Law

231
00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:47.680
this high binding effect
also has for the powerful.

232
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:50.840
I find this amendment to the Basic Law
right and good,

233
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.320
because it ensures
that this 100 billion pot

234
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.960
not a "make a wish",
but that it says exactly:

235
00:12:58.120 --> 00:13:00.520
This is
for the equipment of the Bundeswehr.

236
00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:04.240
This is urgently needed,
It has been broken for many years.

237
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.560
And now the tanks are not driving.

238
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.480
We hope,
we never need them,

239
00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.080
but you must
have operational material.

240
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.320
We can see
what the world situation is at the moment.

241
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:19.200
Can we do that with 100 billion?
That's a lot of money...

242
00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.440
A lot of money. You don't have to
not shoot it out senselessly.

243
00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.000
You can deal with it reasonably.

244
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.200
Incorrect rhetoric: "shoot it out"?

245
00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:31.240
You are right,
is a stupid picture.

246
00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
"Throwing it out the window"
you could say.

247
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.760
In 2020 you have
sued against the rent cap.

248
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.640
Do you also live with Spahn,
like Lindner?

249
00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.480
No, but I also live
for rent in Berlin.

250
00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:48.760
With which politician
do you live with as a subtenant?

251
00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:54.760
It is not a politician,
nor a housing association.

252
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.440
But I have
agreed on an index rent.

253
00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:59.760
What is an index rent?
The ...

254
00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:03.480
When the cost of living
or costs go up,

255
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:07.040
I also have to pay more,
if the costs go down, not.

256
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.160
So I know how
rents are developing in Berlin.

257
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.280
But I can also imagine it ...

258
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.040
I am well paid
and I don't want to minimize that.

259
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.920
We did not want to go
on the misery track.

260
00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.680
Chapter two: Biography.

261
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.840
Why are you in the FDP?

262
00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.160
You are
grown up in Gelsenkirchen

263
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.200
and have lived as a child
lived with five people on 70 square meters.

264
00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:34.200
That actually screams SPD.

265
00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.840
Have you submitted your membership application
by mistake

266
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.240
made with the wrong party?
No.

267
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.280
It really is ...
Who knows Gelsenkirchen ...

268
00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.760
That's right.
How did it come about? How ...

269
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:49.320
I can tell this briefly,
in Gelsenkirchen there was actually

270
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.080
until the 90s
only two parties in the city council.

271
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:55.680
The most social democratic city,
you can imagine.

272
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:59.000
When I first became interested in politics
interested ...

273
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.760
That was about school policy.

274
00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.040
Then I did some research,

275
00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:07.840
was at different parties,
looked at that.

276
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.720
I met a lot of people at the SPD,

277
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.200
who told me
what I can't do,

278
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.600
because my parents
are not academics, etc.

279
00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:21.640
That didn't ...
not really helped.

280
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.800
In the Young Liberals and the FDP
I met people,

281
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.160
who said:
Man, I dare you,

282
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.000
you can do something, trust yourself
and don't let yourself be talked into it.

283
00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.000
This has helped me more in life.

284
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.520
They wanted to poach you because they were
were so few. - Maybe.

285
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.640
They promised something else.
Yes, but I think...

286
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.920
That may be all ...

287
00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.640
Now we have the salad,
now you are in the FDP.

288
00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.400
You won't get out of it.
You also refused military service.

289
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.120
Lindner was an entrepreneur,
what was your excuse?

290
00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:55.880
Conscientious objection
was not an excuse.

291
00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:59.080
I was a civilian service provider
in a nursing home

292
00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.960
and was of the opinion at the time,

293
00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:05.240
that I can contribute more
can contribute to the common good.

294
00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:08.560
And it was practical,
because you weren't imprisoned.

295
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.440
That is part of the truth.

296
00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.680
However, I later withdrew this refusal.
later withdrawn.

297
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:18.200
At 42, when the danger increased
that you would become something political.

298
00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:20.680
Well, I was something.
Was that PR?

299
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.560
No, I wanted to
to learn something about the Bundeswehr.

300
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:26.000
We decide
about it as a parliament,

301
00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.440
whether the Bundeswehr
goes into action.

302
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.040
I said I'll decide about it,
but have no idea about it.

303
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.800
I asked:
Can I afford the

304
00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.840
one or two weeks
at the German Armed Forces?

305
00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:40.760
Mine says it was six days.
Yes, one week.

306
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.720
So six days, not a week.
Yes.

307
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.040
How much do you learn
in six days?

308
00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:49.080
You learn something about everyday life.
I was in Hammelburg.

309
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.120
This is this program
for civilian leaders.

310
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.520
They said: This short week,
or these six days,

311
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.440
you can participate
in a special program.

312
00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.040
That was de luxe, of course,
this is not the normal use.

313
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:05.520
What have you done? Shot up
shot left and right?

314
00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:09.120
We actually shot with the rifle
and the pistol.

315
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:13.160
With the pistol I have even
shot a cup as a beginner.

316
00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:16.320
What were you shooting at?
At targets ...

317
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.240
With gun or bow and arrow?

318
00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.880
No, with a sharp P9,
with which the Bundeswehr works.

319
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:26.520
To me
six days seem like an incredibly short time.

320
00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:28.360
That's where you might learn,

321
00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.640
how to use a jigsaw,
without cutting off your fingers.

322
00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:36.000
Of course, after six days
you don't have a clue,

323
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:38.880
what's going on in the field,
that's clear.

324
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.200
But you learn something
about the operational structures,

325
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:44.120
the structure,
the worries and hardships.

326
00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.000
You just get to know people.

327
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.080
There were sergeant-nursemen,
who were fresh out of the field.

328
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.880
Do you want to greet someone? - Yes ...
You can do that here into the camera 3.

329
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.840
I greet of course
the infantry school in Hammelburg.

330
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.920
They did a great job.
Good.

331
00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.320
There we can also cut super.

332
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.160
In addition to being Minister of Justice
you are also social media minister.

333
00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.720
In the FDP you have
introduced an app,

334
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.400
which evaluates the public relations
of all members of parliament.

335
00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.480
For party colleagues
offer feedback talks.

336
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.320
Are you a control freak?

337
00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.040
No, this is
a form of self-information.

338
00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.000
Sometimes you wonder:

339
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.800
Are people interested in that,
what I have done?

340
00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.920
I have heard, for example,

341
00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:33.480
In editorial departments like yours
you look at ratings,

342
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.440
because you ask yourself:
Did people think that was good?

343
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.040
We as deputies ask ourselves
also in opposition ...

344
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:44.360
You don't make it into the
Federal Law Gazette, but wonders:

345
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:48.520
Gosh, did people care about that,
did people notice?

346
00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:52.320
How can we do an even better job
promote our convictions?

347
00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.840
That is why you also need
Self-information tools.

348
00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.800
I see it more as a service
and so do my colleagues.

349
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.120
Are they filmed as well?
No, that's nonsense.

350
00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.840
Then you would have an insight,
what they're doing, whether they're sleeping.

351
00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.440
No, I'm not interested in that.
Whether they are in the office at all.

352
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.440
I would think about it.

353
00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.040
But that is the culture of presence,
the very old way of thinking.

354
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.360
We are results-oriented.

355
00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:20.840
If one person works
only works four hours a day,

356
00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.160
but in these four hours
something ingenious on the way,

357
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.880
has a super idea,
works super efficiently...

358
00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.840
Or if he makes up for
to make up for his military service.

359
00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.720
I have not
I didn't make up for my military service. - I see.

360
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.360
I have no rank,
I was just six days

361
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:38.920
in the infantry school.
Yes, my mistake.

362
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.360
Excuse me,
Mr. Minister of Justice.

363
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.040
When a party colleague
makes a bad showing,

364
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.360
send him an unsolicited
a criticism by SMS without being asked.

365
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.160
What will Christian Lindner
write to you tonight?

366
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:55.080
I do not know,
I'll see then.

367
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:57.560
But I find
speak openly with each other

368
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.880
or to be able to send SMS to each other ...

369
00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.720
But they are imposing themselves,
after all, no one asked.

370
00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:07.520
They send unsolicited.
This comes from the time,

371
00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.520
when I was the first
parliamentary manager

372
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.520
of the FDP parliamentary group.

373
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:16.080
So it's my job, like a watchdog, to keep the
to keep the store together,

374
00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.000
to make sure
that the team ...

375
00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:23.160
Keeping the sheep of the FDP together?
No, keeping the team together.

376
00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:26.920
The herd of mutton? - No,
the team play has to work.

377
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:29.760
According to "Spiegel" you make
in the Bundestag, you are the instigator,

378
00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.640
signal to the fraction,
when to clap.

379
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:35.640
Is the rest of the party
too stupid to clap? - No.

380
00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:37.680
We prepared this once.

381
00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:41.160
Will you then stand in the Bundestag
with an applause sign? - No.

382
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.840
This is also from my time as
parliamentary managing director.

383
00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:50.760
It's actually normal
that someone is there at the front.

384
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:56.320
This has less to do with applause
but that someone takes care of it,

385
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.280
that order
prevails in the company's own ranks.

386
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:03.040
That is also the task ...
But clapping is an impulse after all.

387
00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:07.760
You clap, after all, when you think,
now you've reached the punch line.

388
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.080
Then they clap on their own.

389
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.240
What the Spiegel writes,
does not necessarily have to be true.

390
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.520
So you don't do that?
Not now anyway.

391
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.000
You just said that you
dictate when to clap.

392
00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.560
No, you read out
that Der Spiegel writes that. - Yes.

393
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:28.560
We can delete that
and I say you do it.

394
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.600
Kurt Krömer says,
Mr. Bushman

395
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:34.440
does not stand in the Bundestag with an
applause sign, but he heats up.

396
00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:37.360
I'm not allowed to do that on the government bench
on the government bench.

397
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:41.040
So you have done it when you
say you don't do it anymore.

398
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.520
My job was to keep order
in our own ranks.

399
00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.600
Today I sit
on the government bench.

400
00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.040
I am forbidden
from the government bench

401
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.520
comments or applause
on things in parliament.

402
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:58.720
But you did it.
What? - The heater.

403
00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.280
My people don't need it at all,
They're always in a good mood.

404
00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:07.240
We record this with cameras,
you know that? - I see.

405
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.960
I see.
No, everything is fine.

406
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.560
The editorial staff has found a troll
who pretends to be you.

407
00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:16.240
He posts like this:

408
00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.960
* Electro-Beats * (Lindner)
At the height of the new economy

409
00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:23.720
I founded a company
which was not successful.

410
00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.880
Today
the prime minister said,

411
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.040
one should also
Pioneer failure

412
00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:33.720
not use a lifetime
biographically as a stigma.

413
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.520
* Electro beats *

414
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.360
This is not a troll,
that's me.

415
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.840
"MB Sounds"
is the name of the SoundCloud account.

416
00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.840
Aren't you going to fight it?
No, I am.

417
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.440
Is that you using
a 12-year-old on ecstasy?

418
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.160
No, that's me. When you're 12
you don't have that much stubble.

419
00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.400
So this is you?
That's me...

420
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:01.960
Were you bored
to play with the train?

421
00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:06.760
No, since I was 12 or 13, I've been doing
music with electronic ...

422
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.960
You are a DJ?
No, I am not a DJ.

423
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.720
A DJ spins records.

424
00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.880
I play on the synthesizer
things into the sequencer,

425
00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.680
arrange that, so rather ...

426
00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.240
Always with speech by Lindner?
No, that was a gag back then.

427
00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:24.680
He gave this speech
in the state parliament of NRW ...

428
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:29.000
We laughed ourselves to death, the gag
has ignited. - Yes, that's good.

429
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.680
Even among the Young Liberals
you have enemies.

430
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.720
They insinuate you,
you have the anthem of the JuLis

431
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:39.000
together with the deputy
Minister President of NRW.

432
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:44.320
(Joachim Stamp)
# With CDU and CSU

433
00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.120
# Makes Germany close its borders

434
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.240
# We will prevent this

435
00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.800
# Not only with high-tech Indians

436
00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:04.720
Yes ...
What are high-tech Indians supposed to be?

437
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.680
That sounds racist.

438
00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.160
That was anti-racist, so to speak.

439
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:12.200
At that time there was an election campaign
in North Rhine-Westphalia

440
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.760
with the CDU candidate
Jürgen Rüttgers.

441
00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:17.560
He used to say:
"Children instead of Indians"

442
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:20.760
and "We do not want
not bring people from India".

443
00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.680
Could one not have
could have made a rhyme,

444
00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.000
where to point out the satire?

445
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.000
Well, but ...
I didn't know that before.

446
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:31.720
This hymn
has, of course, wink.

447
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:37.640
It's so overloaded with pathetic, you can already
already understand the wink.

448
00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:40.400
I did not understand.
Yes ...

449
00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:43.880
That's right, by the way, I wrote that
with Joachim Stamp.

450
00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.000
But that was some time ago.

451
00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.880
This version is from 2002,

452
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:53.360
but we wrote it in 1999,
I think, so it's been a while.

453
00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:58.120
The "WirtschaftsWoche"
called you the Mister Spock of the FDP,

454
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:00.920
and Lindner gave you that.

455
00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:04.520
(laughs) Yes, that was
a parting gift.

456
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:06.720
We laughed our heads off there, too.

457
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.000
Christian Lindner
is actually the gag titan.

458
00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:13.480
He has qualified as a gag writer
on the "heute-show.

459
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:16.160
No ...
Unfortunately, we are already coming to the end.

460
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:19.600
Last question: You walk
to the Bundestag and read as you go.

461
00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.600
Have you ever run into a lamppost?

462
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.560
No, so far I have been able to
in time to get out of the way.

463
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:27.640
Do you really run?
Yes, that's quite good.

464
00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.240
So you have movement in the daily routine
and it has something meditative.

465
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.640
With your bodyguards?
I don't have any.

466
00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.280
No, as attorney general?
No.

467
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.680
Can you answer,
while we go outside? - Oh, yes.

468
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.760
Then we have to cut less.

469
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.360
I don't need one ...
But this is an office ...

470
00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.040
As Attorney General ... - No,
people are still friendly.

471
00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.160
But what if something happens?

472
00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:56.000
So far the people are
actually very friendly.

473
00:25:56.160 --> 00:26:00.200
I think that's good too, bodyguards
restrict the private life.

474
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:02.640
I pity the colleagues
who have to.

475
00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.120
Some ministers have to,
but thank God I don't.

476
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.640
And stop. There, we've reached the end.
Thank you, Mr. Bushman.

477
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.280
You can already look
whether Lindner has written.

478
00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.120
But you do not broadcast
only next week.

479
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.840
But they see it
already live now.

480
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.760
Yes, but then I would have to
get a text message from the future.

481
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:27.200
That you already tell us what
Mr. Lindner will write to you.

482
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.320
I can't do that.
Now it's getting petty towards the end.

483
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.960
Nobody knows the future.

484
00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:36.960
Mr. Lindner will write you
write something, do you think?

485
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.440
I will call you
when I know.

486
00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:44.400
Don't call until next week,
then it will be aired first.

487
00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:47.800
It is quite complicated
with the staggered dates.

488
00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:52.440
Will this talk between the two of us
go down in history

489
00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.920
as the argument of the century?

490
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.800
I don't know, the people involved
The people involved usually don't know that themselves.

491
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.400
These are categories of attribution,
that's what journalists do.

492
00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.960
Did we have a fight?
We can cheat ...

493
00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.760
It was a pleasant conversation.
That you are now speaking in camera 4.

494
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.160
It was a very pleasant,
friendly conversation.

495
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.440
And then why am I all fired up?
Um...

496
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.600
Because you argued with me.
I am in need of harmony.

497
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.040
But you
have been asking questions all the time,

498
00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.600
where I thought
not on German television.

499
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.760
Now you are reversing the roles.
You asked me questions, didn't you?

500
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:34.480
Was this actually a witness interrogation
or an interrogation of the accused?

501
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.680
You were
in the role of the guilty party.

502
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:40.520
No, you are not guilty
in interrogation, but at the end of a ...

503
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:44.120
They were in the interrogation room right now.
I was in an interrogation room.

504
00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.040
We were not in a meadow.

505
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:50.520
In Germany, everyone is innocent
until proven guilty.

506
00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:53.800
There will now be a debate
with the editorial office

507
00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:57.880
and next week we'll announce
whether you are guilty and why.

508
00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.040
I am curious. You'll call me?
I will call you next week.

509
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:04.560
What you see ...
There it is already.

510
00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.440
Then tell me,
what the editors found,

511
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.960
and I say,
whether someone has written to me.

512
00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.200
I can also call Mr. Lindner
and ask him,

513
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.160
what he is about to write to you.

514
00:28:16.120 --> 00:28:18.040
Mr. Bushman,
thank you.

515
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.280
Take care, neighbors.
Bye.

516
00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:21.960
* Music *

517
00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.800
# You are the one for me, for me

518
00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:38.280
# For me, formidable

519
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:45.240
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

520
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:52.360
# Et je voudrais pouvoir un jour
enfin te le dire

521
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:55.760
# Te l'ecrire

522
00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.320
# Dans la langue de Shakespeare

523
00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:05.120
# My daisy, daisy, daisy, desirable

524
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.960
What do these two
these two standing desks?

525
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.480
For the press conference,
that we are giving right now. - I see.

526
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.200
The song runs for another hour,
then we are through.

527
00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.880
Oh, then ...
So that we have sectional views.

528
00:29:18.040 --> 00:29:19.600
One hour?

529
00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:27.360
Do you want to read a poem?
No, but if I ...

530
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:31.080
You have a book with you?
Yes, always. - What are you reading right now?

531
00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.080
This is Hans Kelsen, a ...

532
00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:35.880
Are you preparing
for drama school?

533
00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.560
No, that was
a very clever constitutional lawyer.

534
00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.560
Unfortunately already dead.
Yes, Hans Kelsen.

535
00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:46.640
There was a great exhibition here
at the "House of History" in Berlin.

536
00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:50.640
We could have talked about that.
I always have something to read with me.

537
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.240
That would be a blast ... Now it is
it's over. - Yes, that's how it is then.

538
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:57.680
That would be human.
Mr. Bushman human for a change.

539
00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:59.680
He reads, is one of us.

540
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.160
But making music
is also human.

541
00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:04.320
Yes, but there we have to think about the ...

542
00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.840
(sighs) Good.

543
00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:09.320
Thank you.
Okay.

544
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.280
Bye.
(laughs) Come on in.

545
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.400
Good, thank you.
Yes, gladly.
