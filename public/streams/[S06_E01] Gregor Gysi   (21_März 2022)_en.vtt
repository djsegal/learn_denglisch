1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.040
.

2
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.960
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.400
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.200
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.800
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.560
Gregor Gysi.

7
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.000
Gregor Gy... Mr. Gysi?
Yes?

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.040
Mr. Gysi?
Yes?

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.320
You are already
this is the fourth time you've been on my show.

10
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.800
But not in this one.
Those were other shows, weren't they?

11
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.160
But it's told now, isn't it?
isn't it? - Yes.

12
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.160
Such a politician's life. Not that
we get into a repeat.

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.800
First, we come
into a repetition.

14
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.520
Secondly, I do not answer,
but tell what I want.

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.280
That's why I'm a politician.

16
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.720
Third, I was urged
to come here

17
00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.240
and at some point I surrendered
surrendered to the pressure.

18
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.080
Who pushed you?
I'm not telling.

19
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.360
We still have to talk about that.
I'm going to announce you first, right? - Yes.

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.120
Gregor Gysi, felt the 40th time
with me on the show,

21
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.520
not in this one, but I had
other program, there he was 39 times.

22
00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.400
Today I meet him for the 40th time.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.480
Gregor Gysi, 74 years old,
politician of the Left Party,

24
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.400
Lawyer, author and presenter.

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.680
That's what we need to talk about now.
I'm coming in now, okay?

26
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.680
Yes, I can take it.

27
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.640
* Krömer clears his throat. *

28
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.640
So, Mr. Gysi. Good afternoon first.
Good day.

29
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.240
I have a question.
Yes? No, wait, the questions...

30
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.040
Can I get you something to drink?
That would be nice.

31
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.200
You see? - I have gained so much weight.
Every walk ...

32
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.640
I would never have seen that.
Every walk is an adventure.

33
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.920
Once I'm sitting down ...
I would have died of thirst, Mr. Gysi.

34
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.040
I've been thirsty all day.

35
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.240
Can you make me
make me a sandwich?

36
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.680
You didn't know what that was?
Liverwurst with a pickle on it?

37
00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.200
I can do that,
but not here.

38
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.400
There we have to go to the kitchen
and I think ...

39
00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.440
Can you make me dinner?
I can do that.

40
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.120
What do you eat?

41
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.800
The fact that we're not doing "Chez Krömer
is not yet done,

42
00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.800
but I for my beauty blog
times say ... Gysi private.

43
00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.640
For example, what are you eating tonight?

44
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.680
Today I go with two people,

45
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.800
with whom I have important
have to discuss, eat.

46
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.840
Let's see, maybe I eat
fish and vegetables.

47
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.040
Do you cook yourself?
Rarely. When I can manage it, yes.

48
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.520
It takes a long time. The best
I make stuffed peppers.

49
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.480
But I need time for that.
That's boring.

50
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.320
They are not boring at all.

51
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.800
If I were Mr. Mälzer, I would have
already died of boredom.

52
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.840
That's not why I go to a
cooking show. - It's boring.

53
00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.520
Mr. Gysi, you were chairman
of the Council of Chairmen

54
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.800
of the 15 colleges
of lawyers in the GDR.

55
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.480
It sounds as if a lawyer had
a lawyer made it up. - Yes.

56
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.480
Everything has its meaning there, too.

57
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.520
In the GDR, for example, it was important,
that we were not an organ of the GDR.

58
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.400
That is why in the GDR we were called
not "the" GDR.

59
00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.240
It all had relevance.

60
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.400
In cells like this
have you visited your clients?

61
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.480
They were usually a little smaller.
Yes?

62
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.640
Some were also a little larger.

63
00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.240
But you still know your way around,
know where the water is. - Yes.

64
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.120
Do you know how I know that?
Because I was given one before.

65
00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.600
Have you taken a tour?
Yes.

66
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.360
You ...
There came a French song.

67
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.040
Do you know French?
Of course.

68
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.440
Really?
Yeah, sure, I learned that.

69
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.360
I had French as an elective.
No kidding. - Yes.

70
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.480
And how is your English?
But I don't want to brag.

71
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.840
And how is your English?
Also very good. I was an interpreter.

72
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.160
If you still tell me
that you know Chinese...

73
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.560
I'm in. Not so good yet,
but you need a little bit for that.

74
00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.840
Can we agree
that I ask the questions?

75
00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.400
No.
I don't like that. You are a guest.

76
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.800
Yes.
I have the questions ...

77
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.000
Do you also have a notebook with you?
Of course. - I don't think so.

78
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.200
You are a skilled worker
for animal production ... - No.

79
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.000
I am a skilled worker
for cattle breeding. That's the name of the thing.

80
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.400
What did I say?
Animal production.

81
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.160
What are you?
Skilled worker for cattle breeding.

82
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.440
They are animals after all.

83
00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.000
Yes, but the specialization
is nonsense.

84
00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.120
We had skilled workers ...
(laughs) Take a walk ...

85
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.480
Keep your fingers
on your side. I don't like that.

86
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.680
I am not there
only to do things that you like.

87
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.680
Again, I am a skilled worker ...

88
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.120
Do you mean to say that you are
a demanding guest? - Yeah, sure.

89
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.880
It was always harmonious.

90
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.120
Yes, but not if you
mislabel my profession.

91
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.800
To do the gag again,

92
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.920
you have already done 80 times
in my broadcasts:

93
00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.960
They were at the RBB,
Brandenburg Cattle Insemination Center.

94
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.800
Well, they always came to us.
But it's the RBB. - Yes.

95
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.320
The website is called that because
someone at RBB was too stupid,

96
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:15.400
still "RBB GmbH".

97
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.160
This is your old company.

98
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.000
Well, I've been to state-owned
estates, but must say the following:

99
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.240
The cows
are actually cheated.

100
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.080
Most often there is artificial insemination
and not a real one.

101
00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.880
We won't go into any more detail.
No.

102
00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:33.720
That's dirty stuff.
Right. - Beef stuff.

103
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.360
You were a lawyer and SED member

104
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.240
and were confronted with accusations
confronted. Do you miss that today?

105
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.840
No, that has been settled by the fact
that the Hamburg public prosecutor's office

106
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.520
made a decision,
that this is not true.

107
00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.480
Did they?
Yes, they have.

108
00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.880
There it always says,
they are supposed to have been "IM Notar".

109
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.080
How unimaginative is that, anyway?

110
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.240
Have you not been annoyed
that you were taken for a fool,

111
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.840
that if you had
had been with the Stasi,

112
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.280
you call yourself a lawyer IM notary?
No.

113
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.520
I was annoyed by something else.

114
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.440
I understood that they were angry
me, fought against me, etc.

115
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.440
But with completely false
claims to try,

116
00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:18.920
to put me down has already
already hurt me, I have to say.

117
00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.520
But that's cleared up now? - Yes.
IM notary is really ...

118
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.080
As if I had been in the Stasi
and would have called me:

119
00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.360
IM, the man who was born in Neukölln
comedian was born there

120
00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.040
and then works at rbb.
(laughs) Something like that. - As a cover name.

121
00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:37.800
(sighs) You were even
the last chairman of the SED.

122
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.280
That means you have experience
in getting rid of parties.

123
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.680
Can we sell you to the AfD?
No, that would be the thing too much.

124
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.440
But here's what I will say,
if I may share a moment:

125
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.400
I have found that my profession
has shaped me in a funny way.

126
00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:56.080
Do not filibuster now.

127
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.800
And shaped by it,

128
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.920
that a lawyer only ever has to deal
with people with problems.

129
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.280
This gives rise to a mild
disease from which I suffer.

130
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.760
I am only interested in
People with problems

131
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.800
and facilities with problems.

132
00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.920
When the SED was on the brink,

133
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.240
she interested me
more than before.

134
00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:18.400
During the last federal election
I was seduced for a moment,

135
00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.240
to take care of the Union,
which was on the brink.

136
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.840
But since my party was also on the brink
it was not necessary.

137
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.720
That's a good explanation.

138
00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.640
On the left, they are
the epicenter of the problems.

139
00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.240
About. - There, where problems
were invented. - Yes, also people.

140
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.480
When politicians
are really in trouble ...

141
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:40.120
Women politicians ...
And politicians.

142
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.880
Then we talk to each other,

143
00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:44.880
because people with problems
obviously attract me.

144
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.760
Are you approached on the street
approached by people,

145
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.000
Where you think:
"He's got a hoe, hasn't he"?

146
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.360
No, only people with problems
people with problems. - I see.

147
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.640
It's different for politicians.

148
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.880
In the meantime you have many other
jobs: lawyer, presenter and author.

149
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.880
Why did you choose
the profession of a politician

150
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.600
as a hobby
still additionally draufgeschafft?

151
00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:14.960
Well, I am an unsteady person
and need different sides.

152
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:18.760
In politics, I try to change the
change the zeitgeist, which is fun.

153
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.280
But I cannot
not help a single person.

154
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.960
As a lawyer, I try to,

155
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.880
a single person or a single
individual company to help.

156
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.240
That's fun, too, but there's no
the influence on the zeitgeist.

157
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.960
That's why I need both.

158
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.880
You know in the media
the famous 1:30 sentence,

159
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:41.080
in which politicians
to express themselves, 1:30 seconds.

160
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.320
Like in the daytime news.
There is ...

161
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.400
Be smart and be diligent,
but not longer than 1:30.

162
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.720
Right. There are more and more
politicians,

163
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.240
they can also only
think in 1:30.

164
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.080
I write books,

165
00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.680
to test myself,
whether I still think beyond 1:30.

166
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.120
Oh, I thought,
you write books,

167
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.280
that you read through in 1:30.

168
00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.080
The presenter,
where I also had you as a guest,

169
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.920
is important to me,
because I'm curious about people.

170
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.120
I want to know why you
became the way you became.

171
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.160
Do you mean that nicely or
disrespectful? - Nice. - Yes? Okay.

172
00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.920
I am also interested, for example
in a conservative:

173
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.680
What happened differently in his life
that he became conservative?

174
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.280
and I have just become
different from him?

175
00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.920
If one is not curious,
you should not be a moderator.

176
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.040
You have to be interested in answers
interested and listen.

177
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.920
And you can only talk well
if you can listen.

178
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:41.840
I listened to you, didn't I? Am
Did I interrupt you? - No.

179
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.680
A very little bit.

180
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.000
So I am a very good
moderator, because I just listen.

181
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.040
Yes, you are also
engaged again and again.

182
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.480
Do you notice? - You are
good on the one hand, funny on the other

183
00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.600
and thirdly, you torture your guests
usually a little bit.

184
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.360
Wait, do you feel tortured?
No, do you?

185
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:04.360
I said "as a rule".
I am the exception.

186
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:07.240
In your party you have
through almost every position.

187
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.560
You are the foreign policy spokesman
of the Left Party parliamentary group.

188
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.000
Could there be a worse
time for the job? - No.

189
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.440
Now is the busiest time, isn't it?
Now it's the most terrible, yes.

190
00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.640
If we
may be serious for a moment:

191
00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.640
I had so hoped and believed,
that Russia

192
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:28.600
this war, which is contrary to international law
does not begin.

193
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.760
We'll get to that now,
we'll talk about that in a minute.

194
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:34.400
On 17.02.
you said the following:

195
00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:39.960
Now the USA intelligence agencies
said that until yesterday

196
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.720
the Russian troops
invade Ukraine.

197
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.160
But they did not invade,
My distrust is more justified

198
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.040
than your firm belief
in these secret services.

199
00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.680
That's right.

200
00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:58.440
The intelligence services of the USA have
allegedly told George W. Bush,

201
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:02.240
that Hussein in Iraq had
had weapons of mass destruction.

202
00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.040
But in that case
you were wrong, huh?

203
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:07.240
I was wrong
they were wrong.

204
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.360
On Tuesday they
not marched in, but later.

205
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.000
I knew it first,

206
00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.920
when it recognized the two
so-called People's Republics.

207
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.120
Then I knew he was marching in,
but I did not know

208
00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.400
Does he go only to the Donbass
or to Kiev?

209
00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:24.000
I am really appalled, it is
a war against international law

210
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.560
and our media
also make a mistake.

211
00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.960
According to international law
there are no good and bad wars.

212
00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:35.280
There are only forbidden wars of aggression
and permitted defensive wars.

213
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.040
Russia is waging
a forbidden war of aggression

214
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:41.080
and Ukraine
a permitted defensive war.

215
00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.640
I'm not equating it,
but the NATO invasion of Serbia

216
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.680
was a forbidden war of aggression.

217
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.560
I fight for international law.

218
00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.360
I am told by people
who see it differently,

219
00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:53.280
it's not about the legal.

220
00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:55.160
But if I say in one case,

221
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:59.120
I am not interested in international law,
in the next case, too,

222
00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.720
then international law
no longer exists.

223
00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.640
But we have nothing else
between the states,

224
00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.480
that can work,
that's why I'm fighting for it.

225
00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.920
From 1989 you were
Chairman of the SED.

226
00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:12.600
In 1990, with the USA,

227
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.360
FRG and GDR about
a united Germany.

228
00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:20.200
FRG Foreign Minister Genscher
and USA Secretary of State James Baker

229
00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.880
made the following
with Gorbachev:

230
00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.800
We were in agreement
that there is no intention

231
00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.880
to extend the NATO defense area
to the east.

232
00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.080
This is true not only
with regard to the GDR,

233
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.040
that we do not want to incorporate there
but in general.

234
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:42.400
Why didn't Gorbachev
not put it in writing?

235
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:47.360
Why didn't you, as a lawyer, say:
Gorbachev, think along, write down?

236
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.080
After all, I wasn't his lawyer.

237
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.680
But you could have said:
"Gee ..."

238
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:55.680
At two-plus-four
was promised,

239
00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:00.240
This also results from a
note from four foreign ministries,

240
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:03.200
that there will be no NATO enlargement
will happen.

241
00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:06.520
That was a mistake,
which also provoked Russia.

242
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.760
There were many mistakes made by NATO,
but not a single one,

243
00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:14.360
justifying Russia's war
against Ukraine.

244
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.640
I also always say this
to my people:

245
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.520
We can enumerate
what was done wrong.

246
00:13:20.680 --> 00:13:25.280
But there was no mistake that
justifies this war of aggression.

247
00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.240
You can analyze later,

248
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:31.760
how a different development
development could have been initiated.

249
00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:34.120
I have to say now,
Putin has ...

250
00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.680
Macron has called NATO brain dead.

251
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.720
Putin has strengthened them in a way
way that has never been seen before.

252
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:45.040
Sweden and Finland are thinking about
thinking about becoming NATO members,

253
00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:49.080
because Putin of course
will not attack any NATO country.

254
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.520
If he did that,
he triggers the alliance case

255
00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.760
and we would have
the third world war.

256
00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:58.200
I hope the Russian military and leadership
and the leadership do not go along with this.

257
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.280
For Finland and Sweden
NATO becomes a shield.

258
00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:05.760
Just a few years ago, I would have
I would have criticized them severely for that.

259
00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.320
Tell them now, I think,
Russia will not attack you,

260
00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.720
they say: You didn't believe that
you didn't believe that about Ukraine either.

261
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.400
He did it anyway.

262
00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.520
This makes me
so angry and stunned.

263
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.880
Of course also
especially the suffering of the people.

264
00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.840
Now to your people:
There is a dispute in your party

265
00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.360
about the handling
with Russia and Ukraine.

266
00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:28.200
They accuse Wagenknecht
of being unemotional.

267
00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:31.200
Wagenknecht accuses you of character assassination.
What happened?

268
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.080
We had
a difficult discussion

269
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.440
for the special session
of the Bundestag.

270
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:41.120
Then we had agreed
and during the meeting,

271
00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.240
because Scholz
gave such a rearmament speech,

272
00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.120
which I consider as a conclusion
wrong as a conclusion,

273
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.200
we were in agreement,
we vote no.

274
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.080
The party chairmen,
the chairmen of the parliamentary groups

275
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.440
and the parliamentary
Managing Director

276
00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:58.200
issued a statement
on the voting behavior.

277
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.120
Okay, we could have agreed
could have agreed on that.

278
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.280
Then they still have
made an extra declaration

279
00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:07.920
and thereby of course
counteracts the first statement.

280
00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.680
That really bothered me a lot.

281
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.680
I wrote them that
and she replied to that:

282
00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.480
That is also their right.

283
00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:19.680
Wagenknecht does not want to supply weapons
to Ukraine.

284
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.480
They think it's okay as long as the
weapons do not come from Germany.

285
00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.200
Arms shipments.

286
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:29.120
Do you know why? - You were
against arms deliveries.

287
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.720
I am against arms deliveries
by Germany.

288
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.120
I will explain it to you.
But other weapons?

289
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:38.800
So if it says "made in Germany
is written on it, it is not.

290
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:41.600
But if they come from the U.S. ...
Wait a minute.

291
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.240
Are you in favor of arms deliveries?
May I explain briefly?

292
00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.760
The first question is: Germany
started the Second World War,

293
00:15:49.920 --> 00:15:53.640
with 27 million dead
Soviet citizens.

294
00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.400
When we start,
weapons, we say,

295
00:15:56.560 --> 00:16:00.000
one former Soviet republic
we are arming against another.

296
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.880
How do we do that
with Armenia and Azerbaijan?

297
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.040
This is not possible
for historical reasons.

298
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.000
The other is that Ukraine
has a right of self-defense.

299
00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.840
It is the matter
of the Ukrainian leadership,

300
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:17.960
to decide when it "gives up",
that is not our business.

301
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:21.960
That is why it is permissible to supply a country with weapons
for self-defense.

302
00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:26.360
I do not understand. Dt. weapon,
US weapon ... Weapon is weapon after all.

303
00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.520
Then you have to tell the Ukrainians,

304
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.000
they shall
surrender unconditionally.

305
00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:33.360
Hmm.
That's hard.

306
00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:38.360
That is for Ukraine to decide,
not us.

307
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.960
But for historical reasons
reasons, we are not allowed to supply weapons.

308
00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:45.080
We export 4 billion euros worth of
weapons. - I know that.

309
00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.480
We are exporting more and more weapons.
I am strictly against this.

310
00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:52.560
The weapons are then located in certain
countries on both sides.

311
00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.520
In war zones
weapons must never be supplied to war zones.

312
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.280
Especially not,
if it is like in Syria etc.

313
00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.480
Only the problem is,
I'll say it again:

314
00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:04.880
I do not know
how this war will end.

315
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.760
But the decision to terminate
lies in these two countries:

316
00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:10.400
Russia and Ukraine.

317
00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.680
I hope that they quickly,

318
00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:15.880
at least diplomatically agree
and end the war.

319
00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:17.960
Your party colleague Bodo Ramelow

320
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.800
has called for the reintroduction of
called for the reintroduction of compulsory military service.

321
00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.320
I am against it.
That's a leftist, too, isn't it? - Yes.

322
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.640
If the leftists are already
are in favor of military service,

323
00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:33.280
can we soon buy weapons in the supermarket
like in the USA?

324
00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:38.920
One said that, I am against
the revival of compulsory military service.

325
00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:42.440
By the way, fortunately
also the military leadership,

326
00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.920
the Bundeswehr leadership, against it.

327
00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:46.840
Sometimes the military

328
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.840
more reasonable than
the politicians.

329
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:53.160
Have you done military service?
What kind of thing? No.

330
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:55.720
No. - Why not?

331
00:17:55.880 --> 00:18:00.440
Don't say, "I had a heart defect
heart defect and was a single parent."

332
00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.800
No, I'm explaining
you genetically.

333
00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.760
My grandfather did not serve,
my father did not,

334
00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.880
I have not served
and my two sons have not.

335
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:12.840
Genetic.
You've got yourself quite a ...

336
00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:18.120
But you didn't say:
I won't do it.

337
00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.640
No, that was not possible at all
as a lawyer.

338
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:24.760
That was very difficult.

339
00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.640
When you have nothing to do,

340
00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.920
you can read
read my autobiography.

341
00:18:29.080 --> 00:18:33.000
I'm on page 1 right now.
I have a lot to do.

342
00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:37.480
It also explains why I did not do my
I did not do my military service.

343
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:41.040
I know someone, a great guy,
host, comedian,

344
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:45.360
one who likes to hear people out,
who has completely refused.

345
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.200
But that was different in the Federal Republic
something different than in the GDR.

346
00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:55.040
If you had been a lawyer in the GDR
would have completely refused ...

347
00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:58.160
After all, they refused.

348
00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:01.760
If you were religious,
you could also become a construction soldier,

349
00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.200
you did not have to
you didn't have to pick up a gun.

350
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:09.760
But there are things that were
possible in the Federal Republic,

351
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.480
not in the GDR.

352
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.800
They said in the "Welt":
"If we were in government now,

353
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.840
it would be a disaster."

354
00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.560
Yes, because the government
would fall apart.

355
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:24.960
We could not agree,
100 billion euros into the Basic Law

356
00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:28.480
to increase the size of the Bundeswehr
to take

357
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:34.840
and 0.2% of the gross domestic product
on armaments and the armed forces.

358
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.720
If we did not agree,
but the SPD and the Greens insisted on it,

359
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.440
the government would fall apart.

360
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.320
Is that solidarity,
when you say to your own party,

361
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:46.320
the cardboard noses don't get it right?

362
00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.080
No, not the cardboard ones
don't get it right.

363
00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.720
This was directed
against the other parties.

364
00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.760
When they do an upgrade like that,

365
00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.080
that we cannot go along with,
the government would collapse.

366
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.280
Whether this is so good after she has just
just formed?

367
00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.920
Mr. Gysi, you now have
the chance to show camera 3 ... - Yes?

368
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.600
Where is camera 3?
Behind the glass wall.

369
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.480
... to resign from the left.
Is that imminent, isn't it? - No.

370
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.560
Can't you do that here?
No, that's out of the question for me.

371
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.560
I am since 1967
Member of the party

372
00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.480
and have experienced so much,
that I have to take this step...

373
00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:28.720
I can not imagine any conditions
when I would go him.

374
00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.320
So you're staying with the left.
Of course.

375
00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:37.360
But you...
You know, I like...

376
00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.920
I like something different.
I like when people say to me:

377
00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.360
Mr. Gysi, you are all right,
but in the wrong party.

378
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:48.000
I say, which is the right one?
I never get an answer.

379
00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.320
It's nice too, isn't it? - Join the
Go to the AfD and blow them up.

380
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.720
You can do that,
Mr. Krömer.

381
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:00.040
I'm not going to be accepted there anymore.

382
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.480
I think the AfD has understood
that I don't like them.

383
00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:08.640
You know, I can't
can't joke about it.

384
00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.000
My whole family history
speaks so against the AfD,

385
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:14.640
that I cannot follow such jokes
can not follow.

386
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.280
Let's talk about Putin.

387
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.440
The sanctions are too hard for you,
you said.

388
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.520
Not hard,
I don't use that word at all.

389
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:24.680
I am very much in favor of sanctions ...

390
00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:27.680
It was in the Frankfurter Rundschau.
Yeah, well, anyway.

391
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:29.440
* Krömer reads aloud. *

392
00:21:32.160 --> 00:21:35.560
But that is
something different from "too hard".

393
00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:40.160
So, I am in favor of sanctions
against the Russian leadership

394
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.040
and also against the oligarchs.

395
00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:45.920
I am always happy when their
ships are now confiscated.

396
00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:49.440
I am against economic sanctions
against the population.

397
00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.560
They promise themselves from it,

398
00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.880
that then the population
becomes angry with Putin

399
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:56.520
and rises up against him.

400
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.720
But we do not have media sovereignty
in Russia, Putin has it.

401
00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:03.920
In other words:
Always in the story came out,

402
00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.600
that they then become angry
at the states,

403
00:22:06.760 --> 00:22:09.440
make the sanctions,
not on their leadership.

404
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.000
What they're thinking about,
will not happen.

405
00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:17.320
And secondly: One third
of the total grain production

406
00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.560
is in Russia and Ukraine.

407
00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.000
If that dies off now,

408
00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:25.520
we have millions of deaths from hunger
in the so-called Third World.

409
00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.080
You can't interfere with the
world economic order

410
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.280
and think,
you can handle it.

411
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.840
The disadvantages for us
are also there.

412
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.600
But what is happening to the so-called Third World
is much worse.

413
00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.120
That's why I say: keep things in moderation.

414
00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.680
The bottom line:
Just when you are so emotional,

415
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:49.320
In politics, that's what you're elected for.
that's what you're elected to do.

416
00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:52.760
The Russian leadership, sure,
we have to think of something.

417
00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:56.920
More and more because of me, oligarchs
too, but not the population.

418
00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.200
It did not decide the war.

419
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.000
They suggest that Merkel
and Schröder should talk to Putin.

420
00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:05.280
Schröder was there with his wife.

421
00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.640
The topic has,
I think, settled.

422
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.480
Will Merkel turn the tide?
I don't know.

423
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:13.560
Before the war began, I said,

424
00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.320
you have to
sent there as mediators,

425
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.120
and also when the war began.

426
00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:21.600
I would have sent both together
for the following reason:

427
00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:24.400
Putin does not know
our chancellor.

428
00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.480
When our chancellor travels there,
all right.

429
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.040
Since he has no confidence in him,
he will not learn much.

430
00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.040
I think that Schröder would have
would have figured out what he wants.

431
00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.400
I will try to get
to get a conversation,

432
00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:42.400
to find out
what he was discussing,

433
00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.520
what Putin told him, etc.

434
00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.200
Because the war must be ended
as possible.

435
00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.760
To do this, you need to know
what he actually wants,

436
00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:53.560
what works, what doesn't,
where the red lines are, etc.

437
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.800
Again: In such a situation
you even need secret diplomacy.

438
00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.320
There is no other way.
All this is allowed?

439
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.880
Not everything.
When is Merkel going to Russia?

440
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.640
I don't know
whether she will do that.

441
00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:10.760
Perhaps Schröder has meanwhile
also informed our chancellor

442
00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.920
about the results of the conversation.

443
00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.840
Maybe it was useful,
I do not know.

444
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.480
Ask the Chancellor
and Mr. Schröder.

445
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.280
It's always busy when I call.
I don't understand that at all.

446
00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:26.240
At the end of the show we come
to a shitty topic. - Yes?

447
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:29.680
In 2013 you were
at a panel discussion in Klo

448
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.080
and forgot,
to turn off your microphone.

449
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.680
We look
or listen again.

450
00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:42.560
Is there somewhere
a toilet?

451
00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.040
(Man) Along the wall on the right.
Ah thank you, ah yes.

452
00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:48.480
That it is interfaith ...

453
00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:50.880
* loud splashing *

454
00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.600
Constitutional patriotism.

455
00:24:54.920 --> 00:24:56.440
Incidentally, this is not true.

456
00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:59.360
It's not me who forgot,
but the technician,

457
00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:01.400
accidentally or intentionally.

458
00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.240
That was the technician?
I've been paying attention ever since.

459
00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.960
Was he in the bathroom or you?
Me, but he has to switch off.

460
00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.160
Have you washed your hands?
Of course.

461
00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:14.960
Now don't get
so private and personal.

462
00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.400
We do not go
go to the toilet together.

463
00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:19.720
Border yes, border.
We go out now.

464
00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.480
We are now drawing the line here.
Come along, Mr. Gysi.

465
00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.200
* Krömer coughs. *

466
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.120
* (SIGHS)

467
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.000
So, Mr. Gysi, take a seat.
We say goodbye. That was it.

468
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.240
What color is your feeling?

469
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.960
Red. * Krömer laughs. *
Anything else you want to say? - No.

470
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:43.800
You could still
resign from the Left Party.

471
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.480
No, absolutely not,
and certainly not with you.

472
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.040
Why?
Do me a favor for once.

473
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.800
You have not treated me
treated me decently.

474
00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.240
How now?
I let you finish.

475
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.800
That is not yet decent.
What was indecent now?

476
00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.840
The whole species, the whole species.
What kind?

477
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.960
It is so difficult
in the situation.

478
00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.640
We have such serious problems

479
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.560
and then
a certain sarcasm does not fit in.

480
00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:10.280
I don't know how to do it.

481
00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:13.400
I admire that you manage
manage it to some extent.

482
00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:16.520
Why are you still smoking?
It is harmful to your health.

483
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.840
Because you have stopped now,
or what? - What do you mean now?

484
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.280
I quit in 2004.
Yes? - Of course.

485
00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:25.080
But you are still fighting?
No, I'm completely ...

486
00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:28.160
But before that I was
a very heavy smoker.

487
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.320
Don't get too private now,
I don't want that. - You of all people.

488
00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:34.000
Gregor Gysi, thank you.

489
00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.760
Here you go.

490
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.400
* Music *

491
00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:51.080
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

492
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.560
# For me, formidable

493
00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:00.400
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

494
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:07.680
# Et je voudrais pouvoir un jour
enfin te le dire

495
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:11.000
# Te l'ecrire

496
00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.160
# Dans la

497
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:19.160
That's it? - We could still talk
talk about what we've been through.

498
00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.800
Nah, I really have to get going soon.

499
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.760
I see, but the recording
goes until 10 pm.

500
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.520
Yeah, right.

501
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.000
Are you being picked up?
Is the recording finished?

502
00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.280
The recording is then finished,
when I say so.

503
00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.640
I think ... - Do you have to
catch the plane to L.A.?

504
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.960
Mhm, exactly.
Where do you have to go?

505
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.720
It may be
that I have another question.

506
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.960
Then I get annoyed
when I think in bed at night:

507
00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.000
"If you'd still asked him that."

508
00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:58.840
* (SIGHS)

509
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.680
Now you have unsettled me,
I no longer have a question.

510
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.760
We'll just stop here.
Yes.

511
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.120
So I go.

512
00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:22.240
