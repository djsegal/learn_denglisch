00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.320
# For me, formidable

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.360
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

4
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.360
Good evening,
Ladies and gentlemen.

5
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.680
Welcome to "Chez Krömer
on 14 December 2021.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.160
I am so happy
to be here,

7
00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.640
to sit in this place,
to be invited to Kurt Krömer.

8
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.760
In this glorious show.
Great.

9
00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.680
Come!
Yes, hello.

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.200
Great, I have
watched from here.

11
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.840
It looks great from here.
Good.

12
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.320
If you want, you can come in.
Yes.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.120
Just as you like, Helge.
I'm looking forward, for weeks.

14
00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.680
Ladies and Gentlemen,
my name is Helge Schneider.

15
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.440
I am invited to "Chez Krömer"
and I am very happy,

16
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.040
to finally be in this program,
which probably does not exist for long,

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.880
but still,
today is the 14th of December.

18
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.400
And I congratulate,
I also congratulate inwardly.

19
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.840
Kurt Krömer, congratulations
on the show, especially today's.

20
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.960
I am looking forward
for it for weeks now.

21
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.160
Yes, me too.
Helge is a star, a comedy star.

22
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.760
I ... also ...
I say something again.

23
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.400
I am also looking forward
for it for weeks.

24
00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.480
But only for two weeks,

25
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.640
because I have only
two weeks ago,

26
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.840
that I am one of the two
or three selected,

27
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.480
who are here in this program.

28
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.320
Like this
... best ...

29
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.640
I'm coming in now.
Yes, come in, I am pleased.

30
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.200
I am unarmed,
but I have a gift for you.

31
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.800
We'll get to that in a moment,
it's a special show today.

32
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.720
Yes, this is a special show.
Where do I speak in?

33
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.120
Congratulations again inside,
on the program.

34
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.800
Yes.
This show is good.

35
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.240
Helge is
from Mühlheim.

36
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.320
I have been happy for weeks,
that the switch works.

37
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.840
The Christmas show, is it so?
It is so, the Christmas show.

38
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.120
The Christmas show.
Oh, that's right, wait.

39
00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.400
"Chez Krömer,
Christmas show.

40
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.760
Close the door, close the door!
Otherwise I can't come in.

41
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.160
I'm coming now.
So...

42
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.440
As I said, I am very happy.
I almost forgot.

43
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.560
Being on the show today:
"Chez Krömer".

44
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.640
I think this is going to be
one of my favorite shows,

45
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.040
I will
watch the show too.

46
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.800
* Rumbling and rustling *

47
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.160
What's going on in there?
I'm going in.

48
00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.640
Come on in, Bescherung.
I'm going in.

49
00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.000
The top button always opens,
the push button from my pants.

50
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.680
* Rumbling and rustling *

51
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.320
Helge?
(shouts) I'm coming.

52
00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.520
(laughs) I'm glad.
(shouts) It's open!

53
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.440
* Door buzzer *
Helge?

54
00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.000
I am going in now.
I am going in, I am going in.

55
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.480
Hello.
Merry Christmas, Helge.

56
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.720
Merry Christmas,
today, December 14.

57
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.200
December 13.
On the 13th, how could I...?

58
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.080
And now the gift.
(laughs) It's not wrapped.

59
00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.040
Why don't you sit down first?
Yes, I'll sit down.

60
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.680
I have brought a nice gift
with me.

61
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.640
I knew you lived
in Berlin, in the city,

62
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.560
in which you like to ride a bike
and also has some advantages

63
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:39.760
as a cyclist compared to others,
who do not have a bicycle.

64
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.120
And you must have a bike.
Do you have a bike?

65
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.320
Yes, a cargo bike.
Very good.

66
00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.280
To secure this against theft,
there is this lock.

67
00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.440
I have dismantled it,
it shall now be yours.

68
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.840
There are two keys,
one key is for you.

69
00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.960
The other key
please deposit it with your notary.

70
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.360
Or with the notary.
Is that the gift now?

71
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.160
This is the gift.
That's where I say thank you.

72
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:10.160
And a culinary gift ...
I also have gifts.

73
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.600
First my culinary gift.
Do you hear me? Yes, good.

74
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.120
Do we want the disc ...?
We are not sick after all.

75
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.800
No, no, I wanted to play
play something on the piano.

76
00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:22.440
Yes, play.

77
00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.320
* plays a flourish *

78
00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.440
And now the gift.
Uh, yes.

79
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.240
It is now so ...
Oh yes, thank you.

80
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.440
This apple should be yours.
An apple a day ...

81
00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.760
(both) An apple a day
keeps the doctor away.

82
00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.040
If you eat an apple every day,
then you eat an apple every day.

83
00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.800
This is a good recipe
for eating apples.

84
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.200
For me, this is already
the most beautiful day in my life.

85
00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.240
Helge, here's the thing:
We have a Christmas show.

86
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.120
We're doing those now.

87
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.440
Yes, yes.
(laughs) Today is December 13.

88
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.160
No, today is the 5th of November.
The 5th?

89
00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.680
Today is November 5,
but not on air.

90
00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.360
There is the 13th or 14th of December,
you always do not know.

91
00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.320
We are adjusting to it.
Yes.

92
00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.200
* rustle *

93
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:24.000
And here is my gift.
Uh!

94
00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.200
It's bigger than yours!

95
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.080
* Helge laughs

96
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.800
I am glad.
I am very happy.

97
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.200
So, Merry Christmas.

98
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.280
A penguin,
an emperor penguin, a young one.

99
00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.280
A Christmas penguin.
A young emperor penguin, you?

100
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.240
There are only three of them,
it costs 18,000 euros.

101
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.680
How nice.
Reasonably priced, right?

102
00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.720
I did not want to
show off with money.

103
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.640
What is that? Oh, the wings
are sewn on a bit.

104
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.480
But that can be changed.

105
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.480
Um...
* both laugh *

106
00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.280
Can I use the paper too?
Shall we? Are you christmas...?

107
00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:16.920
Are you Christmasy?
I am Christmasy.

108
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.680
I come with blanket and everything.
Wait a minute.

109
00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:23.360
You can still use the paper,
for smaller things.

110
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:26.840
Pack things and
Give to relatives.

111
00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.800
Bread I have.

112
00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.480
And gingerbread.
Mh, that's very tasty.

113
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.920
Do you do that on it so that people
not know what kind of bread it is?

114
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:45.440
No, this is brown bread.
Black bread, that's why.

115
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.240
Not that there's anything ...
(coughs) My cough.

116
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.120
I have eaten,
otherwise I would eat from it.

117
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.360
But I'll eat the apple.
In 10 days it will be Christmas.

118
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.360
How do you celebrate?
I celebrate very, very, very ...

119
00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.000
... completely,
I do not know yet.

120
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.440
Um, quite ...

121
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.320
... very far away. (laughs)

122
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.680
Are you flying south then?
I don't fly airplanes anymore.

123
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:16.000
I now only drive either
by bike or walk.

124
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.520
To the south?
Or I'll go by car.

125
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.600
Also to the south.
By bike?

126
00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.240
You can also go to the north,
even in winter.

127
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.640
Baltic Sea, also beautiful.
Very beautiful, Baltic Sea.

128
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.080
It does not always have to be
not always be warm.

129
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.400
North Sea is also beautiful.
I have never been there.

130
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.720
Can I have one?
Yes, costs 2 DM.

131
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.120
I don't have them.
I have to get the gifts in.

132
00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:39.640
Do you have any money with you?
I don't have that with me.

133
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.080
Then you can't eat that.
Then I pay later.

134
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:46.520
That would be stupid if I
not be allowed to eat that.

135
00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.560
I have never been to the North Sea,
if that interests anyone.

136
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.520
I was thinking we could
have a Christmas dinner now.

137
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.400
Are you perhaps
not a North Sea guy?

138
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.840
I have never been there,
I do not know why.

139
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.040
Baltic Sea, Timmendorfer Strand,
the whole childhood.

140
00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:06.960
Timmendorfer Beach
and Weissenhäuser Strand.

141
00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:10.640
Where is Weissenhäuser Strand?
Where is that?

142
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.280
Next to Timmendorfer Strand,
2 km away.

143
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.200
Do you know
Timmendorfer Strand?

144
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.880
Udo Lindenberg always rents
always rents the hotel, where he rehearses.

145
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.760
Timmendorfer Strand.
I know it.

146
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.840
Niendorf, Brodten.

147
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.160
These are the places,
that lie there.

148
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.640
Usedom, also beautiful.
Usedom, also beautiful.

149
00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.560
Pritzwalk, do you know Pritzwalk?
Pritzwalk, Pritzwalk.

150
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.000
And say ...

151
00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.000
Do you have tea?
No, but I have...

152
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.160
What do you have
always eat at Christmas?

153
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.200
Whole, or even half.

154
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:51.080
That was a gag now.
Yes?

155
00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.120
People have to laugh.
I have forgotten that.

156
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.880
People expect that.
Exactly.

157
00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:00.720
It can't get too serious.
Exactly.

158
00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:03.520
You have to make people
make them laugh.

159
00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.640
I'll give it a try.
By playing the piano, you know?

160
00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:13.280
* carried melody in minor *

161
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:29.640
* soundless *

162
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.480
* Final chords *

163
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:35.960
That wasn't funny, was it?
But it is possible?

164
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:41.000
We don't have an audience there either,
we usually always have an audience.

165
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:43.000
But I thought,
when you come,

166
00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.040
let's not talk about work for a change,
and no one laughs.

167
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.960
I don't know about you,
laughing all the time:

168
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.920
How's that working out for you?
What do you mean now?

169
00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:55.920
Everywhere we go,
everyone laughs.

170
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.560
I've seen that before, yes.

171
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.520
You come to the baker:
"Ha, ha, he here, ha, ha."

172
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:02.800
And times wants
only two rolls.

173
00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.760
"Ha, ha. I've never had that before,
He wants two rolls."

174
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.680
Sometimes there are slaps in the face too.

175
00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:12.720
"Look there, litter box," I often hear from across the
I often hear from the other side of the street.

176
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.760
Then I always wave.

177
00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.840
Then I always wave.

178
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.520
Then the man says:
"That's not him."

179
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:21.840
Then the woman said:
"Yes, he is."

180
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.880
For me, it's on the S-Bahn,
I've been riding the S-Bahn for 40 years:

181
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:29.200
"It's not you, because
You're definitely not riding the S-Bahn."

182
00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.800
Well, that's really tough.
If I were a secret agent...

183
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.360
I would not have thought, do not you have
you do not have a limousine with a chauffeur?

184
00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.480
Like all the others?
I can show you.

185
00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.200
I do not understand that
now not at all.

186
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360
Does it have a name?

187
00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.800
Do not tear, this is an
Environmental card, it costs 86 euros.

188
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:55.080
Here is the 27.10.
Only for one month 86 euros?

189
00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:58.360
Here I am now ...
What did you think?

190
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:01.680
For a short distance, perhaps?
Have you become so estranged?

191
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.440
I am a pensioner, I can
get a pensioner card.

192
00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.200
It has expired,
Today is the 14th of December.

193
00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.120
I was just about to say that,
you have to be careful.

194
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:17.360
Helge, how is that
with the "litter box":

195
00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:21.280
Are you sick of this?

196
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.800
* Helge laughs cackling *

197
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.760
We'll cut that out,
the question sucked.

198
00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:33.240
You can leave the question in,
I don't have to answer it.

199
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.720
What was the question again?
I forgot about that.

200
00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:41.720
Shall I ask you all the questions
that are asked of me?

201
00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.360
Do.

202
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.480
"Are you funny at home, too?"
No.

203
00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.640
Um... (laughs).

204
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.960
No?
No.

205
00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.320
I see.
You know what my problem is?

206
00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:59.640
That was a joke answer,
I am also funny at home.

207
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:03.160
That is also important.
You are funny, you are a comedian.

208
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:06.280
One of the best comedians,
we have.

209
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.800
I don't understand humor sometimes.

210
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:12.440
Sometimes people bullshit me,
then I don't understand.

211
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.480
I know that, too.
I get totally caught up in it.

212
00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.200
And they: "Hello, a joke!"
Yes, exactly.

213
00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:21.440
Sometimes you have to say ...
I thought a phone call.

214
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.760
Do you have a wastebasket?
No, here.

215
00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.880
Then we make
Christmas dinner now.

216
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:32.960
In Berlin is a Christmas dinner
Sausages with potato salad.

217
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.600
You know, it's so ...

218
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.400
You can drink the sausage water
if you like.

219
00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:43.640
Let's see the potato salad.

220
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.640
Look, we have pickles,
all there.

221
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.520
I am not allowed to eat potato salad
I am not allowed to eat potato salad.

222
00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.160
Is that so?
Are you kind of, what's it called?

223
00:12:55.320 --> 00:13:00.240
Concave? Concave?
No, that's with lenses.

224
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:05.640
Kondit is called that, it says here:
vegan, potato salad vegan.

225
00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:08.160
With vinegar and oil.
And is that called ...

226
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.640
What does that clearly mean:
vegan?

227
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.480
Ladies and gentlemen, today
at "Chez Krömer": Jussuf Schneider.

228
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.120
Yes?
You are ...

229
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:18.480
Jussuf? No.
Converted.

230
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:22.520
No, I am not there,
I have my own religion.

231
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:24.600
My own religion is like this:

232
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.720
The moment I
don't want to eat potato salad,

233
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.240
I say, for religious reasons
I do not eat it.

234
00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.320
But I always eat a cucumber.
Cucumber is good.

235
00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.760
Cornichons. Do you know French?
No.

236
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.080
Latin?
I had French at school.

237
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.920
The cucumber is very tasty.

238
00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.560
I was in love with the teacher,
Mrs. Claire, I did not get anything.

239
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:52.360
Do you want a sausage?
Oh no, not now.

240
00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.240
I have already
eaten a chicken leg.

241
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.560
But eat quietly, you have
probably not eaten yet.

242
00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.240
Have you eaten yet?

243
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.120
No, because I've been looking forward
looking forward to it, I ...

244
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:06.360
What?
Only now do I notice it.

245
00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.920
This is a Christmas tree
upside down, isn't it?

246
00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.160
It's supposed to be funny.
I find it funny.

247
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:15.680
It may be that people
now scream with laughter.

248
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:19.120
Or else they say:
"This looks like crap."

249
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.880
They also say:
"Erna, change the channel."

250
00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.000
That is often the case.
There's everything on television.

251
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.600
You are totally good, answer
to every question in two words.

252
00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.480
And then they switch over,
that also exists.

253
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.720
We do not fulfill
what they want.

254
00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.560
Depending, depending.

255
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:44.080
Can you also be
be really shit on it?

256
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.200
Yes, I can too.
So that you hit the table?

257
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.520
"That's enough!"
(laughs) That's enough!

258
00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:52.920
You see.
There you go.

259
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.960
But Helge, if you
don't eat anything, that's ...

260
00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.960
Yes, yes, out of courtesy.

261
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:00.280
The top button
always opens.

262
00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:02.480
Have you gained weight?
Watch out

263
00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:06.520
When I do gymnastic exercises,
you kind of think...

264
00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.720
Watch out, I'll do so ...

265
00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.320
* quietly plopping *
Do you hear?

266
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.120
Then people think,
that's my back.

267
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.320
Yes.
But that's the button.

268
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:20.720
Then they think: "The poor man,
he's got it in the back."

269
00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.640
How old are you?
Why don't you give me some potato salad?

270
00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:27.000
Yes, that always works.
Suddenly another religion.

271
00:15:27.160 --> 00:15:30.400
That's the way it has to be.
Religion hopping.

272
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:34.160
Yes, man is, ... thank you!
There you go.

273
00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:40.000
This is the most beautiful Christmas
I have ever celebrated.

274
00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:44.440
Is it good?
Well, I must first so ...

275
00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.880
We also have ketchup.
Do you know cats,

276
00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:52.480
that smell for an hour,
then eat nothing after all.

277
00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:54.760
Do you know where to sweat properly?

278
00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.880
When you wear a hat
that looks like a Christmas tree.

279
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:01.520
I have to say ...
Yes, but quite nice.

280
00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:04.200
I sweat,
I don't think I sweat at all.

281
00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.040
Am I sweating?
I sweat anyway.

282
00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:11.040
What was the worst experience
in your life, I wanted to ask.

283
00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.680
The worst?
Yes, but so with celebrities.

284
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:20.680
I was once on "Wetten dass?",
Paris Hilton was there, too,

285
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.920
I then had to leave, it was said:
"You have to go when she comes."

286
00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:27.040
Why is that?
I do not know.

287
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:30.720
That's what the management said.
Which management, yours?

288
00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.360
From Paris Hilton.
I see.

289
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:35.400
I had to get up and leave.
But why?

290
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.480
I see, today is
the ... December 18.

291
00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:44.800
A month ago, "Wetten dass?" was on,
what did you think?

292
00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.880
Fabulous.
Great.

293
00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.480
I would not have known
that group there...

294
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.520
Udo Lindenberg.
Udo, but.

295
00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:54.560
No, with a "but".
ABBA.

296
00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:58.640
I thought they were dead.
How did they get there?

297
00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.240
Maybe these are other people
and they sing playback.

298
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.240
I can only say this.

299
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:08.320
I am really
a very tolerant person.

300
00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:11.080
But ...
But...

301
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.280
So ABBA does not have to be.

302
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:19.240
But that's the way it is,
some people like to eat...

303
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.760
... what is it called,
poinsettia?

304
00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:23.840
Gingerbread.
Gingerbread star.

305
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.400
They like to eat gingerbread.
What do you put there?

306
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.440
I eat first
the potato salad.

307
00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:34.680
That's dessert, I'll eat it afterwards.
afterwards, but I don't finish it.

308
00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.920
They say that
I eat like a mouse.

309
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.520
Is that all now?
I don't like it.

310
00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.520
It doesn't taste good.
You still have to eat, come.

311
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.920
There's nothing more to you.
I'm afraid for my figure.

312
00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:54.400
If I eat a lot of potato salad,
I fall apart, you know?

313
00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.880
Also many.

314
00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.960
Tell me, when you told your parents
you said you wanted to be a comedian:

315
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.560
What was the reaction?
I did not say.

316
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.320
You just did it?
Yes.

317
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.520
But they have
at some point.

318
00:18:10.680 --> 00:18:13.320
Sometime yes.
What did they say?

319
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:18.320
My mother, I once had
a gig in a movie theater,

320
00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:21.640
then she was told:
"Your son steps up there."

321
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.720
I remember it clearly,
she came in there in slippers.

322
00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:29.000
I was especially proud then,
she was also proud of me.

323
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:33.320
But that was a long time ago,
that was 19... When was that?

324
00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:39.600
1980, 1979,
around that time.

325
00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.200
That's when I did
my first performances alone.

326
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.400
I only had one headlight
with a 300-watt bulb in it.

327
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.120
I have
in the cinema to the back,

328
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.120
where actually
is the projection.

329
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.120
He made a small dot
on the stage.

330
00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.320
I had him so focused.

331
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.480
Then I tried to stop myself
the stage in the point.

332
00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:06.360
Without microphone, without anything.

333
00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:09.240
There were about 150 people ...
I eat, what?

334
00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.120
Eat.
There were 150 people.

335
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.880
One of them came
came to me afterwards and said:

336
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:18.640
"You really need to get
Get a microphone."

337
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.200
Then it really started,
I bought myself a microphone.

338
00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:26.000
In 1980 there were
these clip-on things did not exist.

339
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:30.600
I had that once, but
I actually rejected it.

340
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.240
With us it was said:
up to 300 people without a mic.

341
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:36.000
That was so, announcement.
Everything else was shrinkage.

342
00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:41.240
That was in the 1920s/1930s?
No, when am I ... 1996 or so.

343
00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:44.280
What happened in 1996?
That's when I became known.

344
00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:46.040
Well, that's when I started.

345
00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.320
I was at the "Scheinbar" Variete
in Schöneberg.

346
00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.720
That's when everyone imitated you.
Yes?

347
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:57.000
I always thought:
"This tailor is funny,

348
00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:59.440
but you don't do
other comedians!"

349
00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:02.160
The original can only be funny.
Exactly.

350
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.320
There are people
who imitate Karl Valentin.

351
00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.960
Or Helmut Kohl, cabaret artists
are still imitating Kohl today.

352
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.080
Then I wanted to ask ...

353
00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.480
Is it tasty?
Yes, very tasty.

354
00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:18.920
Shall we talk about your letter
to Olaf Scholz?

355
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.560
For all I care.

356
00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.640
Only if you want to.
Go ahead, talk.

357
00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.720
What was that about
Olaf Scholz and the letter?

358
00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:30.720
I have typed the letter
and sent it.

359
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.920
Bomb.
No, I did not send that one.

360
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.760
Here it is.

361
00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.000
Yeah, look: I have
an old typewriter.

362
00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.840
With it I write
sometimes also crime novels.

363
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.360
This is an old Triumph Matura.
Really?

364
00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.920
It's from my mother,
She was a secretary at the tax office.

365
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.520
(laughs) At the tax office?
Yes. (laughs)

366
00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.440
Therefore, the old machine.

367
00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.360
Fee here, tax office there.
Left pocket, right pocket.

368
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.440
Fee here, zack to the tax office,
at least half goes there.

369
00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.560
90/10.
Yes, the 90/10 contract.

370
00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.640
Then I used the machine
written a letter

371
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:11.320
and put it on my Facebook page
I do not remember.

372
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.360
Or sent by mail?
That can also be.

373
00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.320
Yes, by mail,
Olaf Scholz has already contacted us.

374
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.960
Yeah, I don't know.

375
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:23.480
What is it like for you now,
sitting here without an audience?

376
00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.880
Where is the audience supposed to go here?
There is no room here.

377
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:32.560
They could sit outside.
What's it like without an audience?

378
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.520
We are live people, after all.
That is live.

379
00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:38.680
Today is December 13, isn't it?
That's live.

380
00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:44.440
15th, that's a Monday.
December 15 live.

381
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:46.640
This is a Monday.

382
00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:49.840
It is a live broadcast, after all.
That is live.

383
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.040
But without an audience, you ...
We can not do without an audience.

384
00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:57.200
Depending on what you do.

385
00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.800
When you perform in front of an audience,
it's a completely different matter.

386
00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:07.200
But that does not mean that you
can't have a conversation,

387
00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:10.240
when there is no audience,
like we are now.

388
00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.880
But we don't
actually no show here.

389
00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:15.480
We are talking.
We are talking.

390
00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:18.480
We are funny too.
And fun, right?

391
00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.080
There are many comedians,
who are not funny in private.

392
00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:25.360
Then one is disappointed.
But I adore them.

393
00:22:25.520 --> 00:22:29.040
They're boring as shit,
or so bitter.

394
00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:32.920
If that is so ...
You are the way you are.

395
00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:36.960
I am the way I am, that is why I am
I am also authentic on stage.

396
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:41.480
But there are comedians,
who are then the complete opposite.

397
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.360
Probably,
that always appealed to me,

398
00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.920
to read about such people,
what they are like in private.

399
00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:52.200
I loved the discrepancy
between the stage,

400
00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.320
where they make their appearances
and take everything totally seriously,

401
00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:01.000
For example, the clown Adrian Wettach,
called Grock.

402
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:06.480
He was a famous man.
The greatest clown of all time.

403
00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:10.480
His private history then
to read what the for faibles had,

404
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:15.480
he wrote the book "Memoirs",
which you can hardly read,

405
00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:18.240
that's just showing off,
many people do that.

406
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.480
He had all his life
a program that ran for 90 minutes,

407
00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:27.440
he has tinkered with it for decades,
always the same program!

408
00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:30.960
In the beginning it was
only 20 min, or 17 min.

409
00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.640
In the very early days of vaudeville
there were the small acts.

410
00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:37.680
Then at some point he had
his own circus.

411
00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.280
There he has then
made longer numbers.

412
00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:44.560
Once you've seen it,
see it from today's point of view,

413
00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:49.000
puts himself in the time,
it's phenomenal,

414
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.400
what such a guy
of liberal thinking

415
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:54.680
brought over the ramp.

416
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.160
Do you want to be
be more serious in private?

417
00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.000
I don't want to separate that at all.
Neither do I.

418
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.720
I get up and I am
in a bad mood e.g.

419
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.040
But mostly I am
in a good mood and make my jokes.

420
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:15.720
When the profession
as the profession has captured me,

421
00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.960
that's me,
that has become my profession.

422
00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.000
After all, the profession is just a title.

423
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:28.640
That is only a supplement
to the life you lead there.

424
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.720
You can compare it
with a doctor.

425
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:38.520
He doesn't do anything else after 8 hours
something completely different.

426
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:40.800
It goes even further.

427
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:47.200
I just feel
just pretty comfortable in it.

428
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.840
Come what may.

429
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I don't give a shit either,
how many people are there.

430
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.960
I started at that time:
Three people were there.

431
00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:58.880
After 10 years
then came about 40 people.

432
00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.120
Maybe it was only 30.
Yes.

433
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.600
You can tell,
that's a good start.

434
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.800
I would say to anyone
who does comedy, "Do it!"

435
00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.920
Yes, then you have
worked that out for yourself.

436
00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:14.960
It's like learning to swim,
it doesn't go away.

437
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:19.680
There are people who are
famous overnight with something.

438
00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:24.840
They can't handle it.
Yes, they go crazy.

439
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.720
But if you, like me,
performed in front of 3 people,

440
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.960
the next day there were
6 people, then 12 people,

441
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:37.880
then you have taken the basis
the basis for the rest of your life,

442
00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.520
to work in any situation
also to work.

443
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.520
I don't mind that at all.

444
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.320
I never went crazy either.
You never went crazy either.

445
00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.880
So that you bought a golden
Helicopter, for example.

446
00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:54.480
I still look today,
when something costs over 1000 euros,

447
00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:58.560
then I think for 6 weeks,
whether this has to be.

448
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.760
Yes, that is of course ...
That is no longer the case with me.

449
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.760
Because you have it more,
Savings.

450
00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:11.360
Do you have savings?
Yes, savings for the tax office.

451
00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.440
This is my pride and joy.

452
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.160
Shall I say a fucking word:
Tax prepayment.

453
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:21.920
Tax prepayment,
especially for people like me ...

454
00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.880
My advance tax payment
is calculated according to this,

455
00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:28.560
what I earned in 2019,
after that came two years ...

456
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.160
I have to eat,
we only have seconds left.

457
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:35.440
After that I earned little, but
I'm not interested in all that.

458
00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:39.320
I have saved, I have money for
the taxes, so I pay them.

459
00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:44.040
I have no desire
to move to an island

460
00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.960
and then to live with shell companies
to live together.

461
00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.600
Is that what you want us to say?

462
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:53.160
We stay in Germany
and pay our taxes here.

463
00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.640
We pay dog tax ...

464
00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.880
Captain Iglo and ...
... Thingy tax ...

465
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.200
... and the little elf.
Bye.

466
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.400
Come on, let's go outside.
Yes, of course.

467
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.240
* plays a
short boogie-woogie *

468
00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:11.840
Can you,
when you get out, say:

469
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.480
"Have a great Christmas!"
Yeah, okay.

470
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.240
I would go now.
Are you going or am I?

471
00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:20.320
I'm leaving, now.

472
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.760
But that was once again
a nice Christmas.

473
00:27:25.920 --> 00:27:29.000
Yes, we wish everyone
a blessed ...

474
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.160
Stand here next to me,
Mr. Helge.

475
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:35.240
We are not on a first name basis.
Shall we be on a first-name basis?

476
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.680
Yes, we have now
through this television show

477
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:40.840
also got to know each other better.
Yes.

478
00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.560
I know you like
like to eat potato salad.

479
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.320
Something has grown together.
And sausages.

480
00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:49.240
What belongs together has grown together,
what belongs together.

481
00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.240
Right,
a very old sentence of mine.

482
00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:57.320
Merry Christmas
and a blessed 2022.

483
00:27:57.480 --> 00:28:01.280
May always also with you everything
come true twice over,

484
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:03.080
as you wish.

485
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.240
I reproduce the words exactly
as you said them.

486
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:13.960
I also wish you
all the best for the year 2022.

487
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:20.360
And also, dear viewers,
here and in front of the screens,

488
00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.800
we wish you
a wonderful Christmas.

489
00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:31.320
(laughs and coughs) Yes.
With lots of potato salad ...

490
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:35.720
... vinegar and ...
God bless you.

491
00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.760
Exactly.
Bye.
