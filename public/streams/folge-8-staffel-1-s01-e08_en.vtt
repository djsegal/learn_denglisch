1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.400
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.240
I am Fritz.
- Greta.

4
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.840
Greta. Beautiful name.

5
00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.560
Everything you hear in this house
is top secret.

6
00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.880
I know that.

7
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.480
Stored in the engine shed
13 times serious treason

8
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.360
for the illegal import
of warfare agents.

9
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.120
Anti-aircraft shells, tanks
and now poison gas.

10
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.360
Where is the movie?

11
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.800
You don't know
who you're dealing with.

12
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.200
King's films were always
only one copy was ever made.

13
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.200
We must solve the problem
before the elections.

14
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.400
I need your help.

15
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.160
Krajewski is the key.
Finally.

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:49.400
*disturbed breathing*

17
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.240
(Dr. Schmidt) Take it easy.
Nothing will happen to you.

18
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.760
Relax your body.

19
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.600
All shackles fall off.

20
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.440
Take a deep breath ...

21
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.360
and from.

22
00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.520
Yes.

23
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.280
Good.

24
00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.920
Your body relaxes
and all restraints fall away.

25
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.320
If you want it.

26
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.000
You concentrate
on your eyes now.

27
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.400
All those little muscles
behind your eyes

28
00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.920
and how
these muscles relax.

29
00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.640
And when you realize,

30
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.880
that your eyes
can no longer be opened,

31
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.880
even if you wish,
then nod.

32
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.920
I will now
remove the blindfold,

33
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.120
but your eyes
have relaxed so much,

34
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.880
that they
can no longer be opened.

35
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.320
And now we will
this state of relaxation,

36
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.400
that flows through your body,
will intensify once again,

37
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.800
by opening your eyes very briefly
and closing them again.

38
00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.960
But when closing
you go even deeper

39
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.680
into a state of relaxation
into.

40
00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.240
Open your eyes ... now!

41
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.440
*dark music*

42
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.480
*Gereon breathes frantically.

43
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.640
*uncanny music

44
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.200
*rhythmic music

45
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.400
(woman) First of all
the library must be dusted.

46
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.480
But be careful,

47
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.520
Many of the folios
are very valuable.

48
00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.880
Then the stairs,
skirting boards and floors.

49
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.520
Knock out the carpets first.
And then the silver.

50
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:22.440
You could do it so wonderfully,
that everything shines beautifully.

51
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.120
Kids, get in the cab!
8 p.m. Dinner.

52
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.440
Cheese and salad as usual,
cucumber,

53
00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.400
but not the pickled ones,
they are too salty.

54
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.120
And Greta, he'll ask you,
but he's not allowed meat.

55
00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.880
Dr. Hutten
has reminded us again.

56
00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.560
So no exception.

57
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.960
Just say,
there's nothing else in the house.

58
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.000
Then he
not get the wrong idea.

59
00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.200
And now I'll leave you alone.

60
00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.400
So my dears,
Here we go.

61
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.480
Please drive.

62
00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.720
*she sighs.

63
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.400
*calm, swinging music

64
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.480
Nice dress.
- Thank you.

65
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.840
I have to be back by half past seven.
- A point of honor.

66
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.920
At eight o'clock at the latest,
that's when the old man comes.

67
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.520
So, youngster, remember:
Last return journey in 60 minutes.

68
00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.400
If you're not here on time,
it means: swim.

69
00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.760
Get in,
the gentlemen.

70
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.240
The tickets please.

71
00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.680
So, the outward journey was free.
The return trip costs twice as much.

72
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.400
Mrs. Benda
doesn't mean all that.

73
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.720
It's just very accurate.

74
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.760
Gretchen, they're bigwigs.
They were born to be a pain in the ass.

75
00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.560
I just want to
do everything right.

76
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.560
That's their method.
That you're still protecting them.

77
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.760
Don't say that.
- That's the way it is.

78
00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.760
Psst. I'm glad
that I have a job at all.

79
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.440
You are now
as a defendant.

80
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:40.200
That means,
You do not have to testify.

81
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.400
The police are
is obliged to provide evidence.

82
00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:44.560
When do I get out?

83
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.760
After the interrogation
an appointment with the magistrate.

84
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.920
When will I get out of here?
- I know the man.

85
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.440
Which doesn't mean
that he's playing along.

86
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.960
That way.
- Just a moment.

87
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:57.200
Why that way?

88
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.920
Where are you taking Mr. Nyssen?

89
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.520
Around the front.

90
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.800
Through the entrance hall?
- That's the instruction.

91
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.480
This can't be true.
- There he is!

92
00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.600
Move aside.
Leave the way clear!

93
00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:16.880
Turn off the appliances!

94
00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.880
The presumption of innocence applies.
Surely that can't be true!

95
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.480
None of these pictures
may be published.

96
00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.440
Who informed the press?
Did you?

97
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.360
In the German Reich
freedom of the press applies.

98
00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.200
We were deliberately
through the main entrance.

99
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.880
To the point: I have
the analysis of the samples.

100
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.800
You're pretending,
as if this were a trifle.

101
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.560
For whom does Nyssen AG order
chemical warfare agent?

102
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.840
The import of pesticides
is neither prohibited nor limited.

103
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.360
Please let your client
speak for himself.

104
00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:57.640
Who is this poison gas for?
- I was deceived.

105
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.280
The order was for
pesticides.

106
00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.560
Ah yes.

107
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.480
What for?

108
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.640
To control pests.

109
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.560
Nyssen AG
trades in iron and steel.

110
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:16.840
My mother's company has
has nothing to do with the order.

111
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.280
Your mother will be amazed,

112
00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:22.800
what is being
is smuggled through the country.

113
00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.320
We will not testify,
as long as he is a defendant.

114
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.840
I just want to know
whether Mr. Nyssen will take the rap

115
00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.600
for those,
who came up with this.

116
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.640
The magistrate will simply wave this baseless
simply wave the matter through.

117
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.360
The results of our samples
are clear.

118
00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.640
If you would please take your seat again
again, Mr. Attorney!

119
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.680
In the wagons
contain phosgene.

120
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.160
One according to the Geneva Protocol
and the Treaty of Versailles

121
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.400
banned chemical warfare agent.

122
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.400
With this quantity you could
a city the size of Berlin

123
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.560
destroy all life.

124
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:07.640
For this you will
have to answer for.

125
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.000
Nobody waves anything through
with such a suspicion.

126
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.160
Like this. Now, if you could just give us a minute
in private ...

127
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.760
*He whispers.

128
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.600
I know
who you think are pests

129
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.640
and what drives the men
in your environment.

130
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.480
But if I were the Allied
Arms Control Commission

131
00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.920
and inform the League of Nations ...

132
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:02.720
You will not
not do yourself any favors.

133
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.920
You feel protected
from your friends.

134
00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.240
I know many of these men.

135
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.480
To them, you are nothing
but a puppet.

136
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.320
You are the puppet.

137
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.880
The puppet
of a democratic aberration,

138
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:19.480
that has gripped this country.

139
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.520
No.

140
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.800
Nyssen, move out!

141
00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.800
Everything.

142
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.480
*Crack*

143
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.160
(Fritz) I'll give you all that.

144
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.360
The water,
the clouds, the sun.

145
00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:56.880
And the hut too.

146
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.440
Will be expropriated anyway
sooner or later.

147
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.160
*Bell

148
00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.520
For God's sake!

149
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.960
The ferry!

150
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.720
We have to get back.
I won't make it to eight otherwise.

151
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.480
You'll be home by eight.

152
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.640
I have to go to work.
They're kicking me out.

153
00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.920
Trust me.
I only mean well with you.

154
00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.000
This is the last one.
- Yes, and?

155
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:33.280
I can't swim over there.
- Greta, do you trust me?

156
00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:34.880
*she sighs.

157
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:36.320
Watch out.

158
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:45.680
Fritz?

159
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:48.720
One second, doll. Patience.

160
00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.760
Fritz?

161
00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.960
(Fritz) Right away.

162
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:06.360
*Glass clinks.

163
00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.880
Just a moment.

164
00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:12.240
*lively music*

165
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360
You knew that.
- Here you go.

166
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.760
You've already been here.

167
00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.360
Had to thread your return journey
somehow.

168
00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.640
*lively music*

169
00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:37.760
Yes, the bread is old.
But the beer is cold.

170
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:51.720
Wow!

171
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:03.240
*lively music*

172
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.400
Here comes the shore.

173
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.680
Be careful with the trees.

174
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.720
*They laugh.

175
00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.880
(Fritz) Come, come, come!

176
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.000
Oh, that's going to be close.

177
00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.520
You have my word, Greta.

178
00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.800
Next one in two minutes.

179
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.720
Otto.
Have you been waiting long?

180
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.120
So, now let's try the.
Barbituric acid derivative.

181
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.400
What is that?

182
00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.200
For people like you
pure nerve gold.

183
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.120
Give me that twice,
please.

184
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.720
Six to eight drops.

185
00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.760
It will take a little while,
until you have the right dose.

186
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.240
That's right. Thank you.

187
00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.840
Reunion.

188
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.600
*Doorbell, door closes.

189
00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.200
*Engine noise

190
00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.440
Tomorrow morning, seven o'clock then.

191
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:36.160
Good night, Krüger.

192
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.000
Hello?

193
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.600
(Greta) Right away!

194
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.440
Good evening, Mr. Regierungsrat.
- Miss Overbeck.

195
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.200
All flown out.

196
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.120
Your wife has prepared
an evening meal ...

197
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.840
No, by no means.

198
00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.480
Why don't you fry me ...
this one.

199
00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.200
I've been looking forward
the whole week.

200
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:15.600
Oh, and why don't you get me
a beer to celebrate.

201
00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:18.640
In the cellar behind the coals.
Thank you, Greta.

202
00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.440
*He knocks.

203
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:29.240
Ready immediately.

204
00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:30.640
That smells good!

205
00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.640
I always get
from the barn quarter.

206
00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.240
They're only available there.

207
00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:38.440
Have you eaten yet?
Miss Overbeck?

208
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:40.880
Me? No.
Later, when you've...

209
00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:43.600
Would you
keep me company?

210
00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.440
I'll get a beer too.

211
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.480
Here, it tastes best,
right in the kitchen.

212
00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720
Well, come on.

213
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.480
*He sighs with pleasure.

214
00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.480
By the way, Greta ...
*He clears his throat.

215
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:01.800
Not a word to anyone.

216
00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:04.760
We are surrounded by enemies of the state.

217
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.000
*exciting music*

218
00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:19.360
*Door is unlocked.

219
00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:22.960
(You have a visitor.

220
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.360
Ten minutes. No physical contact.

221
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.400
What is it?

222
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.560
It's a difficult time for me.

223
00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.720
It's getting even harder. Now.

224
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.440
You have no idea
how bad it already is.

225
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.680
Yes, I did.

226
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:04.520
It's my fault.

227
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200
No.

228
00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:10.840
No, Svetlana, you're not.
You're not sho...

229
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:12.560
Shut up and listen to me.

230
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:17.920
You trusted me.

231
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.200
I have betrayed you.

232
00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.560
What are you talking about?

233
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.640
I'm talking about the train.

234
00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.400
What do you know about the train?

235
00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:37.920
Everything.

236
00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.960
*exciting music*

237
00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:43.800
*Buzz*
Come here!

238
00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:46.320
Get the cops!
Can you hear me?!

239
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:47.960
Come here!

240
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.440
Come here!

241
00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:54.800
Come here at last!
- Are you ready?

242
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.400
Yes, get the cops,
I need my stuff!

243
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.960
In there? That's impossible.

244
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.560
What kind of store is that?
That's where the bigwigs go.

245
00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:10.160
First eat and chat,
then dance and shag.

246
00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.760
Politicians, bankers, our bosses.

247
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.880
Where is the movie?
That's trouble.

248
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.560
Up the stairs behind the restaurant,
there are rooms there.

249
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.160
*Krajewski coughs.

250
00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:27.360
Where are the movies stored?
In the Armenian's room.

251
00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.320
Shit.
What kind of Armenian?

252
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.160
We get ourselves
official papers

253
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.760
and tomorrow we dance here
with a full team.

254
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.440
Where is this room?

255
00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:41.640
Past the bar
on the other side of the room

256
00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:43.520
There's a corridor with a door.

257
00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.280
Can I finally get
the fucking soup?

258
00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.360
Where are the movies?

259
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.440
There's a stone ... huge,
a rock.

260
00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:53.760
That's where all the stuff is.

261
00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:57.000
A safe?
Something like that.

262
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:58.560
*He coughs.

263
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.400
And the key
has the Armenian?

264
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.400
No, it's
in shiny gold things.

265
00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:06.720
I don't know ... so Monden.

266
00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.120
No!

267
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:12.360
Do not go!

268
00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.960
No, don't go!

269
00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:20.400
Stay here, you assholes!
You promised me!

270
00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:37.400
*Honk*

271
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.800
Good evening, sir.
I have a reservation.

272
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:51.200
You're in there
a bit of cinnabar.

273
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.440
And then you get this.

274
00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.240
No!
 But only then.

275
00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.480
Only then.

276
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.200
*exciting music*

277
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:13.400
Thank you.
 Here you go.

278
00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.000
A mocha, please.
Coming right up.

279
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.400
Sooo, and now off you go!

280
00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:34.800
*He groans.

281
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.320
Forget it, youngster.
- Go get the maitre.

282
00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:47.840
'a damp squib
I will do.

283
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.840
The Armenian is waiting for me.

284
00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.400
Wait.

285
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.720
(sings) "You're crazy,
my child, you have to go to Berlin."

286
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.360
"Where the crazy people are,
that's where you belong."

287
00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.280
*exciting music*

288
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.720
What is it, Franz?

289
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:30.360
Evening, Edgar.
I've got something for you.

290
00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.240
*exciting music*

291
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.720
I ... found out something.

292
00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:44.280
What ...

293
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.600
Large.

294
00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:52.200
There's a lot of money at stake,
but I want to be involved.

295
00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.560
Any other wishes?

296
00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:01.720
Hey!
Huh?

297
00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.000
Precious
precious lifetime.

298
00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.680
And I don't know what for.
So get to the point.

299
00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:12.280
The police, they divert weapons.
From their warehouse.

300
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.880
*exciting music*

301
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:05.160
About the police weapons,
that's ... true, I swear.

302
00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.400
What are you doing?

303
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.400
I, I know the camp.
I can lead you there.

304
00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:14.840
I don't need your connections
with the police.

305
00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:17.120
I own the police.

306
00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:33.880
Don't show your face here again.

307
00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.360
*creak*

308
00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.240
*exciting music*

309
00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.720
*Steps*

310
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.400
Leave the weapon holstered.
Do not turn around.

311
00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.800
I'll shoot you on the spot.

312
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.160
To the window.

313
00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.560
Bring down the curtain.

314
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.600
Spread.

315
00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:07.120
The commissioner from Cologne, huh?

316
00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.880
The movies in the fabric. All of them.

317
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.360
Forget it.

318
00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.280
*murmur of voices*

319
00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.800
*exciting music*

320
00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.400
Go ahead.

321
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:46.600
Shit! You bastards!

322
00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.920
What are you doing here again?
Where is Rath?

323
00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.280
They're killing me, all of us!
Come on, pull yourself together, you little tie!

324
00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:57.280
I want to leave! Give me my stuff!
Shut up.

325
00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760
Stay here!

326
00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:02.800
Hey! Stay here!

327
00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:05.800
Come on, hurry up!

328
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.400
*There's a knock.

329
00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:10.200
(Boss, are you all right?

330
00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:12.480
Boss?

331
00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.000
Yes, everything is fine.

332
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600
Shoo, shoo!

333
00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:33.160
How are you going to get out of here, huh?
Together with you. Come on.

334
00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:52.360
Gereon Rath.
We know everything about you.

335
00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:56.760
Where you live, where you work,
when you sleep, when you shit.

336
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.760
We know your favorite pub.
Keep your mouth shut!

337
00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.560
Your father, your sister-in-law,
your nephew. Everything.

338
00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:04.960
Next.

339
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.160
Yucatan.

340
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.840
Get moving. Go.

341
00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.280
*exciting music*

342
00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.920
Ah!

343
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.560
*excited shouts*

344
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.560
*He groans.

345
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.880
*He growls.

346
00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.320
Stop! Stop it!

347
00:27:35.560 --> 00:27:36.800
Stop it!

348
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880
*He groans.

349
00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.240
*screams*

350
00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:57.960
Nobody shoots anymore.

351
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.320
Lower your weapons!

352
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.800
Don't overdo it, boy.

353
00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.200
Tell them
to throw away their weapons.

354
00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:15.760
Weapons away.

355
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.120
I said: Drop your weapons!

356
00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.400
Pick that up!

357
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.000
Game on.

358
00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:47.520
*exciting music*

359
00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:58.440
*Exciting music
mixes with piano music*.

360

*loud bang*

363
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.440
Quiet, Brown, quiet.

364
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:18.440
Go to the car! Over there!

365
00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.840
So, what are you going to do
with this?

366
00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.920
Get lost!

367
00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.680
*dark music*

368
00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.720
Get out of the car!

*Krajewski breathes frantically.

370
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.320
Here, take this.

371
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.280
Go somewhere.

372
00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:36.960
That's best,
you disappear for a while.

373
00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.240
Make something of it!

374
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.320
*Wolter laughs.

375
00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:57.280
You really are
a bird, you.

376
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.160
What do we do now
with the movies?

377
00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.000
There are politicians on it.

378
00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.920
It's something like
'a life insurance policy.

379
00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.600
We take a look at them.

380
00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:13.640
Comm.

381
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.560
Go.

I know him!
He ... he's a councillor.

384
00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:38.480
Ouch!

385
00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.720
I even know his wife.

386
00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.240
(laughs) Oh God.

387
00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.480
Ah, wonderful!

388
00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:51.560
Everything is there,
who has rank and name.

389
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.680
*Wolter laughs.

390
00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:02.280

Connect me to Cologne, 1308.

(I'm listening.
It's me.

397
00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.440
Gereon.

398
00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.560
I have the movie.

399
00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.360
Everything there?
Yes.

400
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.120
Negative and positive.

401
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:57.360
Destroyed?

402
00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:00.520
You destroyed everything
on the spot?

403
00:34:02.280 --> 00:34:04.000
Gereon?
Of course.

404
00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.440
*He sighs.

405
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:09.920
Thank you, son.

406
00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.200
When are you coming back?

407
00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.560
I'm not coming back.

Bruno, I have to ask you
ask you something.

420

Hmm?

421
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:30.320
Where did you get my medicine?

422
00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.440
Well, from your girl.

423
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:38.000
The little cheeky one.
Charlotte.

424
00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:45.960
Look at it this way: a man like me
has to watch out like hell,

425
00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:48.480
who is watching him
is watching him.

426
00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.320
It's water under the bridge.

427
00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:00.480
You guys are real policemen?

428
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:02.240
Yeah.
How exciting!

429
00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:05.400
(with English accent)
Murder and manslaughter?

430
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:08.680
No, I work in the ...
vice squad.

431
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.640
What is it called in English?
Sex and crime.

432
00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:15.400
Oooooo!
Sex and crime.

433
00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:17.800
You are arrested.
German Polizeiman.

434
00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.680
What do you think?

435
00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.480
Edgar ...

436
00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:40.720
I can see that,
You are very upset.

437
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.960
I understand you.

438
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.800
I'm really very sorry
that this has happened.

439
00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:53.200
I am very grateful to you,

440

that you
that you acted so prudently.

441
00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:00.200
I am indebted to you.
Forever. And you know that.

442
00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:02.720
In this way, the capacities complement each other.

443
00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:05.840
*There's a knock.

444
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.280
(Boss?
- Yes.

445
00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:08.840
We have them.

446
00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800

451

(Dr. Schmidt)
... the state of relaxation,

456
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:36.240
that flows through your whole body
flows through your whole body,

457
00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:39.920
by briefly opening your eyes
and closing them again.

458
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.760
But when closing
you go even deeper

459
00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.400
into a state of relaxation.

460
00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:51.400
Open your eyes ... now.

461
00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Good.

462
00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.640
Close your eyes.

463
00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.720
But try
not fight it.

464
00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.560
I am now counting backwards.

465
00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640
100 ...

466
00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.400
What happened?

467
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.640
Where did you get my medicine?
From your girl.

468
00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:15.240
Can I ask you for something?
I already understood.

469
00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:16.560
99 ...

470
00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.800
You lied to me.
No.

471
00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:20.680

472
00:41:21.320 --> 00:41:22.800

Hello.

477
00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:19.640
Wake up.

478
00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:29.440
Gereon.

479
00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:47.920
What happened?

480
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:49.640
What about you?

481
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.440
Where have you been all night?

482
00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:06.600
Shall I unlock the door for you?

483
00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.200
Get out of here.

484
00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.160
What about you?

485
00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.560
Get lost!

486
00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.800
I'll get help.
I don't want to see you anymore.

487
00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:24.360
Get lost!

488

*slow music*

489
00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.120
(Dearest Helga,

490
00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:54.480
in my head swirl
for days, weeks.

491
00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.800
To you. To us.
They just tumble over each other.

492
00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.240
But one of them has now
caught on and stabilized:

493
00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:06.400
I can't and don't want to live our
live our secrecy any longer.

494
00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:10.200
You say you can't just
start over in Berlin.

495
00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.760
I have to understand that,
even if it is difficult.

496
00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
But I can't go back
back to Cologne.

497
00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.160
Back to a life,
that shies away from the truth.

498
00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.160
That hides from her.

499
00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.840
Forgive me. Gereon.)
