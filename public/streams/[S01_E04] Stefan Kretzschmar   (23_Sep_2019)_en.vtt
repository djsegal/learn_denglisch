00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.920
* Music *

3
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.040
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

4
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.440
Uh...
We had a bit of stress.

5
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.520
Today is the fourth show,
the season finale.

6
00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:35.040
For this program we had
86 people invited.

7
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.720
86 people have cancelled.
* Audience laughs. *

8
00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.760
That's a rate of ...

9
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.880
100 percent.

10
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.160
Because I said,
we only invite assholes.

11
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.440
Um... I made a mistake.

12
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.280
I apologize for that.
We have changed the concept.

13
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.960
"Chez Krömer" is no longer the
place to go for assholes.

14
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.320
So for assholes ...
and friends.

15
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.960
* Laughter *

16
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.440
But we do not say
who is who. * Laughter *

17
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.800
Today a very good friend is here.
We have known each other for ten years.

18
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.520
It's handball player ...

19
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.320
I have to read because, as I said
is a very good friend.

20
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.360
It is Stefan Kretzschmar.

21
00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.560
He is 46,
but looks 18.

22
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.960
He is the blossoming life,
a handball icon

23
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.880
and recently sports director
of the foxes in Berlin-Reinickendorf.

24
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.080
I am very happy.

25
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.920
Mr. Kretzschmar? Yes.

26
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.280
I'm happy too, of course.
* Laughter *

27
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.520
Was that critical in any way?

28
00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.960
Do you feel
like I'm showing you up?

29
00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.840
Not yet.
* (LAUGHING)

30
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.720
Joy is in the foreground, isn't it?

31
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.880
I'm so happy to be here
to be here in the season finale.

32
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.120
* Laughter * And in the
probably last show.

33
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.240
* Laughter *

34
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.960
This is how only
friends talk about friends.

35
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.880
I'm going in now.
* (LAUGHING)

36
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.880
* long humming *

37
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.280
* Hum *

38
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.920
* Laughter *

39
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.440
Hello, my friend!
* (LAUGHING)

40
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.800
But that's nice.

41
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.400
I'm glad you're here.
We can walk around again.

42
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.440
* Laughter *

43
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.680
Good. So...

44
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.840
Mr. Kretzschmar,
I'm glad you're here.

45
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.400
Are we on a first name basis? Pardon?
Are we on first name terms?

46
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.800
We are friends, after all.
Yes. So?

47
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.880
We are really good friends.
Do we pull it off professionally?

48
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.520
What's that smell?
You smoke?

49
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.200
Is there anything dead in the room?

50
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
In a moment. Do you smoke, too?
Something dead is about to enter the room.

51
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.680
I am actually a non-smoker.
Was anything critical?

52
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.560
Not yet.
Would you come again?

53
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.000
* Laughter *

54
00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.880
Are you asking this
as a woman or as a man? * (LAUGHING)

55
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.640
(ironically) It's a crackerjack gag.

56
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.400
Please write down the cracker gag.

57
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.600
Kretzschmar, Stefan Kretzschmar.

58
00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.960
Actually, I am a non-smoker.

59
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.720
Are you allowed to
smoke in public? No.

60
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.280
You are a sports icon.
Yes, but I have read ...

61
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.360
Passive smoking causes cancer.

62
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.440
And ... That's why I bought
I bought cigarettes.

63
00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.280
Whenever someone smokes,
I smoke against it. Great.

64
00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.520
You are a great guy.
I am so happy that you are here.

65
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.800
You are the best guest
I've ever had.

66
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.400
You have
changed the concept of the show.

67
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.240
We had to change it,

68
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.800
because I have speculated
I have speculated.

69
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.800
I would have to do this
for another ten years.

70
00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.640
Where in the East did you invest?

71
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.560
I do not know,
My tax advisor did it.

72
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600
Boomtown Eberswalde?

73
00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.480
You, it stinks here.

74
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.960
Is that the ceiling?
Kurti, what else should it be?

75
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.520
Are you calling me Kurti?
I see. Kurt.

76
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.880
Is this going to be one of those bromance things?
* That's up to you.

77
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.760
What do you think about a
Candlelight Dinner? Sounds cool.

78
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.160
It's our ten-year anniversary. You and me?
Yes. Fine.

79
00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.400
We got to know each other
when you were 34.

80
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.760
Where did we meet?

81
00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.600
In handball.
You stood in the goal.

82
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.560
Here, on behalf of ... Yes.

83
00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.640
(laughs) Taped them off.

84
00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.080
On behalf of all ratepayers
I let you buy this bottle.

85
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.720
* Laughter *

86
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.640
We celebrate with champagne? Yes.

87
00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.440
We have never done this before.

88
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.960
I thought,
because we're on TV...

89
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.080
Mmm. Champagne in the interrogation room.

90
00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.560
There. All clear.

91
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.480
And here ...

92
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.440
* Laughter *

93
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.120
* Laughter *

94
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.120
Watch out, snookums.
Now comes the trick?

95
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.480
I thought we were having kebabs.
What do you think?

96
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.360
* Laughter *

97
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.480
Kebab is great.

98
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.480
You thought:
a cup of champagne and a kebab?

99
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:42.160
* Laughter *

100
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.920
Well ...

101
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.280
Is that ... Happy
on your wedding anniversary, my darling.

102
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.600
We've known each other for ten years now.

103
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.520
Is this Neukölln, or what?

104
00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.160
Is there for the anniversary
a cup of champagne and kebab?

105
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.680
Weren't you happy?
Why don't you open it?

106
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.160
So you celebrate all your anniversaries
and anniversaries like this?

107
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.720
Are you single by now?

108
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:10.400
I am single because
had a wedding dinner the other day.

109
00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.960
It's clear.
* (LAUGHING)

110
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.640
Do you know Turkish hand water?
You can use it.

111
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.280
Do not drink.

112
00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.480
Old butterfly!
Have you smelled?

113
00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.760
Of course.
That's what you put on your hands.

114
00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.720
Give it to me.
"Give it here!

115
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.680
* Laughter *

116
00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.080
You rub it in
and then it sniffs beautifully.

117
00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.600
I wanted to go
to go into town! * Laughter *

118
00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.080
That won't work anymore.
Eat your kebab, I'll ask questions.

119
00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.280
Are you comfortable?
I feel like a million bucks.

120
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.240
Rub it in. It's great on you.
You can do it over the arms.

121
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.840
Watch out, not that
the tattoos come off. * (LAUGHING)

122
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.640
Beautiful story,
your bohemian hand water ...

123
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.560
(groans) Turkish hand water.
Turkish hand water.

124
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.280
Now you're with the Foxes, right?

125
00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:09.360
I have recently become a fox.

126
00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.880
What did the people of Leipzig have to say about it?

127
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:17.920
The whole East was not so pleased
about the task with the foxes.

128
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.280
The foxes are not
not really an eastern club.

129
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.520
You announced earlier ...

130
00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.760
Foxes is Reinickendorf ...

131
00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.440
We see ourselves
as an all-Berlin association.

132
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.520
Eat your kebab. How do you do it,
with that weird hand water?

133
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:38.160
This is not a flower kebab.
Don't you like it?

134
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.160
I have
not hungry for kebab at all.

135
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:45.240
At least drink the champagne.
What's the point of that?

136
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.440
I make every effort,
so that you feel comfortable.

137
00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.840
Eat it up,
or I'll get mad.

138
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.480
* Laughter *

139
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.440
Then again no guests come,
because you feel like you've been had.

140
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.560
But not,
because I have not eaten a kebab.

141
00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:03.040
There are other reasons,
why no more guests come here.

142
00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:06.840
I would say,
the main reason is you. * Laughter *

143
00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.400
How? I've only done one show
made. I have seen it.

144
00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:18.080
On Insta, my first comment was:
"There's no one else coming." * Laughter *

145
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.640
Then I called you.
Then you called directly.

146
00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.120
After you deleted my comment
deleted. * Laughter *

147
00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.720
Then you said:
"Kretzsche, help!"

148
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.440
After all, you are my friend.

149
00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:33.560
Only people still come,
who in normal life

150
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.440
also like to be insulted.

151
00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.800
Politicians. You'll get them,
They're not used to it any other way.

152
00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:42.520
But people like us,
from normal life...

153
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.640
From normal life?
You arrived by helicopter.

154
00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.640
I came by cab. From
Reinickendorf to Masurenallee.

155
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.000
As the crow flies: three kilometers.

156
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.320
I prefer to eat the kebab.

157
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.640
That would make me popular.

158
00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.240
So ...
How old is the kebab, Kurti?

159
00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:05.720
This is from yesterday's rehearsal.
Yeah, that's it. * (LAUGHING)

160
00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:07.720
Eat the kebab!

161
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.760
I licked over one of them.

162
00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.480
About the?

163
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:21.320
Kurti, I can't eat that one.

164
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.120
Eat, please.
Make as if you like it.

165
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.720
Did you put something else in,
what the gag should be?

166
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.880
Is it particularly sharp?
I have put nails in it.

167
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.920
Nails. And razor blades.
I bite off once for your sake.

168
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:37.560
For the sake of our friendship.

169
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.360
Our first kebab together.

170
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.240
Do you ever take a bite?

171
00:09:43.560 --> 00:09:47.760
You eat first. Then I'll check...
* Whether it's still good.

172
00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.920
Dude, you eat kebab ...
Nice, huh?

173
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:54.480
Your mother was a handball player,
father handballer ...

174
00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.440
It was clear that you...
* (LAUGHING)

175
00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.720
What are you doing now?
Super.

176
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.160
I'm out of concentration.

177
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.840
Mother was a handball player...
Father was a handball player.

178
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.760
You are practically
born into a handball caste.

179
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.760
* Laughter *

180
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.240
It was actually clear, of course.

181
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:24.240
My parents
were successful handball players.

182
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.240
My mom was the best
the best player in the world.

183
00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.680
When?
It was the 70s.

184
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.240
You don't talk with your mouth full.
Kurti ...

185
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:35.640
You prepared that gag, though.
* (LAUGHING)

186
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.000
Thank you very much.
I just remembered.

187
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.840
I can't get into the line.
My face.

188
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.720
Did you answer?
Yes, of course.

189
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.360
Both were handball players.

190
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.440
Was that all?
That answered the question.

191
00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.720
That I will also become a handball player ...
That was my question.

192
00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.720
Don't ask me my question.
I answered it in the affirmative.

193
00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.200
Is this going on now:
"Yes, no, maybe"?

194
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.280
It depends on the question.

195
00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:07.000
Put it in the champagne,
It's all in there anyway.

196
00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.320
Handball wisdom:

197
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.920
"If you can't do anything, you go in goal
or to the outside left."

198
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:17.680
You added "outside left."
* (LAUGHING)

199
00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:20.840
(laughs) It says here.
There was a dot after "goal.

200
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.040
"Or on the far left". No.
How did you get to the far left?

201
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:27.640
I was too small at the time.
Little ones always play on the outside left.

202
00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:30.200
Did you start at four?
With seven.

203
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.080
With seven? Yes.

204
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.880
With Dr. Kurt Ritter
in Friedrichshain.

205
00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:39.280
You made that up.
No. You are ill-prepared.

206
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.240
I told you that
ten years ago.

207
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.960
I'll forget about it.
You stood in the gate and asked:

208
00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:49.800
"You have such a sharp throw.
Where did you learn it?"

209
00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.240
I said, "At Dr. Kurt Ritter's
in Friedrichshain."

210
00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:58.000
You said, "Oh, Dr. Kurt Ritter?"
I said, "Yes, Dr. Kurt Ritter."

211
00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.240
* (LAUGHING)
You forgot that?

212
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:05.920
Was that at Kurt Ritter
in Friedrichshain? Exactly.

213
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:10.240
I was too small.
The little ones have to go to the outside left.

214
00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:13.280
The fat ones go into the gate.
* Laughter *

215
00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.760
Is Heinevetter fat?
Heinevetter is the exception.

216
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:20.600
How much longer will Heinevetter
with the Foxes?

217
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.840
Three quarters of a year to go,
still this season.

218
00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.600
What are you laughing at?
That's a mean question.

219
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.920
Why?
Because you're so ...

220
00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:34.760
It's clear that Heinevetter
leaves. This is an interrogation.

221
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.000
You're probably trying
to get some information out of him,

222
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160
that no one knows yet. Exactly.

223
00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:43.160
* Laughter *

224
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.400
What is your favorite color?
* Laughter *

225
00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.040
I don't know.
See?

226
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.560
Maybe we'll find out.
Let's find out.

227
00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.160
Usually black.
Black is not a color.

228
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.360
I see that in you today.

229
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:03.760
Horny, isn't it? I have the feeling
you're coming to a funeral.

230
00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.360
It's your last show!
* (LAUGHING)

231
00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.520
Has something of funeral. Yes.
But it's nice that you were there.

232
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.080
Don't we want to
do something together?

233
00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:18.000
I would be happy.
We would do well.

234
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.760
Something with handball? We would be
Good Guy and Bad Guy. Awesome.

235
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.840
Then guests will come again.

236
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.080
I don't give a shit about guests.

237
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.440
Are we doing something without guests?

238
00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.480
Without guests and spectators.

239
00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.080
Nothing recorded,
we just meet. * Laughter *

240
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.960
Live ... We meet
once a week to eat cake.

241
00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:43.040
You were on MTV.
It tastes like shit, too.

242
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.280
What's the matter?
Don't you have any decent beer?

243
00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.080
No. When you called,

244
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.280
you asked what I wanted to drink.
I said, "Beer."

245
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.240
You were also on MTV. Yes.
* (LAUGHING)

246
00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.080
I have something prepared.
I am curious

247
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.280
* Music *

248
00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.320
You are
at home with Stefan Kretzschmar.

249
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:08.080
All people,
who collect stamps

250
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.720
or play the pan flute,
should switch off.

251
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.560
We record at Kretzschmars
always then,

252
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.720
when the schedule allows it.

253
00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:20.960
The show is
tailored to the music fan,

254
00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.360
with an illustrious crowd of guests.

255
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.080
There are already such people ...

256
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:30.320
Not necessarily just celebrity musicians,

257
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.400
talking about their new record,

258
00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.760
but people
who also have something to say.

259
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:39.640
* Laughter *

260
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.760
It's embarrassing, isn't it?
Hurts, huh?

261
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.840
It really hurt me.

262
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.640
* Laughter *

263
00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.160
One is ashamed
for his own friend.

264
00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.760
Were those smokey eyes?
Yes.

265
00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:54.680
* Laughter *

266
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:56.680
Can you still do that today?

267
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.520
Let's say,
we go to a film award.

268
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.320
It's only hypothetical.

269
00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:07.800
Did you do this yourself? No,
is had a ... Of course!

270
00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:11.480
Do you still want? You haven't seen the good
MTV times.

271
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.160
No, we did not have
no cable television.

272
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.280
Where were you at the end of the 90s?
In Neukölln is clear ...

273
00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.680
You will laugh. In Reinickendorf.
No! Yes.

274
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.200
You are a Neuköllner.
After the divorce of my parents

275
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.840
we moved.

276
00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.600
I only had ARD, ZDF and SAT.1,
but crinkly. * Laughter *

277
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:35.680
But ... I grew up with "Starship
Enterprise" and "Love Boat.

278
00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:40.480
That explains a lot.
Haven't you been to the TV yet?

279
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.920
It now goes
in the other direction, a dialogue.

280
00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:49.560
At the end of the 90s? That's when I...
You're two years younger than me.

281
00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.560
Late 90s? Sure.
I wasn't working then...

282
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.360
* Laughter *

283
00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:58.080
But?
Why do you ask the questions?

284
00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:02.240
What are you doing? Sit down here,
and you'll see how hard it is.

285
00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.920
It's not my first time in such a
in a room like this. I come from the GDR.

286
00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.800
Have you been in interrogation rooms?
Yes.

287
00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:13.200
This was called
"political training".

288
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.560
How old were you?
You are 46.

289
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:19.080
When the GDR closed down,
you were ... 16.

290
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:22.400
You were already in the interrogation room?

291
00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.240
Yes, in rooms
that looked like this one.

292
00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.040
What did they want from you?

293
00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.080
They wanted to explain rules to me,

294
00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:33.680
how to behave in socialist
abroad is to behave.

295
00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:36.200
Do not
Move away from the group ...

296
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.080
Do not run on the dam.
Run on the dam?

297
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.600
On the dam,
On the road.

298
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.840
* Laughter *

299
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.040
* Laughter *

300
00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.640
Age ...

301
00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.280
What do you want with "dam" now?

302
00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:58.720
You must not run onto the embankment,
because otherwise you will be run over.

303
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:03.960
Do you mean the sidewalk?
A dam, a road! A dam?

304
00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.640
There is a dam on the Baltic Sea.
That means dam, Kürfürstendamm for example.

305
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.840
* (LAUGHING)
I know...

306
00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:15.080
Kurfürstendamm, Kaiserdamm.
Yes. I see.

307
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.280
Are you saying "Kurfürstenstraße"?

308
00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:19.400
Oh, there are those too.
* Laughter *

309
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:24.800
They did not explain to me that I
not to run onto the dam.

310
00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.600
I was that smart when I was 15.

311
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.880
They told you not to move
not to move away from the team,

312
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.560
and then drop you off. That must have been
must have been a tough interrogation.

313
00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.600
Always in rows of two
hold hands.

314
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:46.320
That was before ... You were
tied up with cable ties,

315
00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.080
so they can explain it to you?

316
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:50.400
We didn't have cable ties.

317
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.600
But two people came in with
trench coat came in and explained to me,

318
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.800
how I have to behave.

319
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.200
Don't make a mockery of it.

320
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:03.160
Why are you getting so bitchy?
A serious issue. You become crowning.

321
00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.360
Coquettish?
We love each other.

322
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.880
Toad on the dam.
* Laughter *

323
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.880
Yes, we love each other.
Don't be so catty.

324
00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:14.160
When I ask a question,
you can act surprised.

325
00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:16.400
"The very fat Otto!"

326
00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.200
All right, let's do it from now on.
Okay.

327
00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:22.000
Do you have another question? Yes.

328
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.120
Do you have an opinion?

329
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.040
Yes.

330
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.400
* Laughter *

331
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.640
Is everyone allowed to speak their mind?

332
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.200
You are a sow.

333
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.960
Nowadays, society is like that,

334
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.080
that for every comment
you get one on the face.

335
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.960
Nobody wants that anymore. No professional
no professional athlete to that anymore.

336
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.680
They all go
their comfortable way.

337
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.720
No one sticks his head out
higher than it has to,

338
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:54.600
because he is afraid
of getting hit on the head.

339
00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.840
I would not expose myself to that.

340
00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.520
We have in our country
freedom of expression on that point,

341
00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.080
that we do not go to jail
we don't go to jail for criticism,

342
00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:08.280
but no freedom of opinion
in the true sense of the word.

343
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.840
The topic came up,
because I said,

344
00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.680
"Freedom of speech in the true sense of the word
no longer exists."

345
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:19.000
Most people find themselves
in economic dependencies.

346
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:23.080
A job ... Only you are not
in no economic dependence.

347
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:24.880
You have nothing.

348
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:30.400
You are a comedian:
They can say what they want.

349
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.600
Always under the theme
"I am a comedian".

350
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:38.080
Only because "colorful society"
and "foreigners" appeared in it,

351
00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.920
the AfD grabbed it and did,
as if you were one of them.

352
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.920
Then I thought:
"No, I don't want that."

353
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.400
I know you're not one of them,
that you are not one of them.

354
00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:53.040
I am very far away.
But they used it that way.

355
00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:57.520
How long did that shit go on? Three
days? "What's wrong with Kretzsche?"

356
00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.360
My two examples of
freedom of expression were unfortunate.

357
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:04.080
I should have named three,
four more.

358
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.160
That sneaky way.

359
00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:10.080
They pick 30 out of a
45-minute interview 30 out of

360
00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.720
and open a barrel.

361
00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.600
You hear it and see it
and you say "Okay".

362
00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.880
But we don't even ask anymore.
I never do that again.

363
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.160
But you still
open your mouth.

364
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:24.720
Yes, but no more video interviews,
where you cut something out.

365
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:28.120
You can take everything
out of context.

366
00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.040
Either,
you do a live broadcast ...

367
00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:33.320
* Laughter *

368
00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.240
So ...

369
00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:38.320
Or you trust ...

370
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.160
the one who does it.

371
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.480
You trust me, don't you?
Yeah, unfortunately. * (LAUGHING)

372
00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:47.960
I have never
never driven wrong with it.

373
00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:51.360
You've never let me down before.
Yeah, right?

374
00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:54.080
You didn't. Still don't.
Not yet.

375
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:56.760
But if I say
say one more sentence ...

376
00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.960
Nudist for example: I have you
always envied. * Laughter *

377
00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:04.320
You were just naked.
You can do that too.

378
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.840
You can do that.
Yes, after I lose weight.

379
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.760
You do have a body.
Yes, they call me Body Klaus.

380
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:16.320
Stage name: Kurt Körper.
Are you shitting me?

381
00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.960
No,
I've already seen you naked!

382
00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:22.560
Yes? You can be seen.
Mmm! * (LAUGHING)

383
00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:25.960
(laughs) You see?
Don't grin at me like that.

384
00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:30.840
On Instagram we would put hearts
and put a filter over it.

385
00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:34.720
So... Can I give you a hug?
Yes, please.

386
00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.160
* Laughter *

387
00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:43.400
(laughs) Don't squeeze so hard.

388
00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.320
And what does the press
from such a statement?

389
00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:52.240
She calls
all kinds of heinies and says:

390
00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:55.800
"Kretzschmar says freedom of opinion
no longer exists."

391
00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.360
That is complete nonsense,
because I explicitly say

392
00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:03.080
that freedom of expression
legally exists.

393
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.080
Okay.
We're going to talk about the foxes now. Yes.

394
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:07.880
There's the ...

395
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.080
You know handball well.
Of course you do.

396
00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.240
In an FAZ article you said,

397
00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:15.960
You think soccer sucks,
but handball is cool. Yes.

398
00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:18.880
I think that's great.
That's my opinion.

399
00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:23.800
But this did not turn into a shitstorm.
No, why should it?

400
00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.360
Well, you can
out of the window.

401
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.640
So, you are now
Director of the Foxes. Yes.

402
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.360
Mr. Director.
No, I am the sports director.

403
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.560
And...
Please apologize to me.

404
00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:39.800
Stop now.
* (LAUGHING)

405
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.400
How now?
And... Foxes. Yes.

406
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.160
Boring: You are responsible
for communication and sponsoring.

407
00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.680
Yes, communication.
For freedom of expression of the sport?

408
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.720
Let's do something together.
Foxes podcast.

409
00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:01.560
With Kurti,
the old handball goalkeeper.

410
00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:04.840
That would be revolutionary.
Me as a goalkeeper? No.

411
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.360
No, a podcast host,
who used to be a goalkeeper.

412
00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:12.640
You are a handball expert.
Of course.

413
00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.320
Don't we want to do something
on a professional level?

414
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:21.320
What do you have in mind?
Coverage, aftermath...

415
00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:24.120
What is it called?
Do like this after the game,

416
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.000
as if it had been done better.
What is it called?

417
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.400
Expert. Yes!
* (LAUGHING)

418
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.200
Expert.
You have become one by now.

419
00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.200
Don't you want to do something?

420
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:37.240
You are even friends with
with the national team.

421
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.120
I was in bed with all of them.
* Laughter *

422
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.720
Except for Andi Wolff.
He's bitchy.

423
00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:45.680
He has ... He wants so much.
Then I thought: No.

424
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.600
You're good at hugging.
You are certainly also affectionate.

425
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.840
And Frank Steffel
is club president with you?

426
00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.080
That's right, it's my president.

427
00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:02.120
There were these scenes today
on Alexanderplatz.

428
00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:04.720
Edmund Stoiber,
protected by umbrellas,

429
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.400
talked and then said:

430
00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.640
(Stoiber) They will certainly
certainly not drive us out.

431
00:24:12.040 --> 00:24:14.480
He did not want to be
be driven away,

432
00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:19.160
but besides punks
there were also counter-demonstrators.

433
00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:23.160
There should have been 20, 30,
maybe more than 50.

434
00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:26.920
Again and again
eggs and vegetables at Frank Steffel.

435
00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:31.400
It did not hit him, but
the event was canceled.

436
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:37.120
Dude. That's Frank Steffel,
who was hiding behind Stoiber.

437
00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.440
* Laughter * He does not hide,
he's putting up a barrier.

438
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:42.720
Behind him?
That is a circle runner.

439
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.440
* Laughter *

440
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.320
He stood behind him,
to protect him from the front?

441
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.520
* (LAUGHING)
He is the defense boss.

442
00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.840
I thought,
Stoiber would be pelted with eggs

443
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:57.800
and he protects himself behind him.

444
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.160
No, the defense chief
organizes the defense from behind.

445
00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:05.600
The 6:0 formation. Ah,
they played handball! Sure.

446
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.680
I thought they were eggs.
No ...

447
00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.720
Then it was not so,
that they do not like him.

448
00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.560
Not at all. Stoiber just has to
just turn around and transform himself.

449
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.240
He is already enchanted.
He just needs to transform himself.

450
00:25:20.400 --> 00:25:22.920
He just has to catch the egg.
That's what they say.

451
00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.920
Catch the egg, turn around,
put the thing in!

452
00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.120
And Steffel ... Astrein.

453
00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.560
Good man, huh?
Good to have someone standing behind you.

454
00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.200
One for the defense,
who keeps things tight at the back.

455
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.320
That was an unsatisfactory answer
for you, wasn't it? Yes.

456
00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:45.320
You imagined it differently.
Apologize to Steffel.

457
00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:46.960
* (LAUGHING)
That's...

458
00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.840
For me, that's a carpet slut.
* Laughter * As a man?

459
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.680
He has a carpet store.
But a carpet slut is female.

460
00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:58.080
He sells carpets.

461
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:01.760
Not anymore.
Yes, he has the carpet store.

462
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.840
At the time of the ZDF broadcast
his wife was there.

463
00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:09.120
The journalist asked:
"Is your husband a carpet salesman?"

464
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.080
"No!"
* Laughter *

465
00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.800
"What's he selling?"

466
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.480
"Flooring."
* Laughter *

467
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.200
That's when I thought for the first time,
he's out of his mind.

468
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:22.560
But I apologize.
Of course. Cordially.

469
00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.800
But now he is a politician.
He still has that.

470
00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:29.560
"CDU Member of the Bundestag Steffel.

471
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.400
mailed
for the 2017 federal election

472
00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:36.440
Election letters with the forged
Chancellor's signature."

473
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.400
What does it say
in the bottom right-hand corner of your contract?

474
00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.320
* Laughter *

475
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.160
Which one does it say?

476
00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.360
Do you think it says "Angela Merkel"?
* (LAUGHING) Maybe it is.

477
00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:52.640
Do I have
a contract with Angela Merkel?

478
00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:55.000
Well, if Steffel
has signed ...

479
00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:57.320
I haven't looked yet.

480
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:02.160
The contract is not with Steffel,
but with the managing director.

481
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:05.720
I would join the foxes,
if it weren't for Steffel.

482
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.840
Why do you make that a condition?
You're coming for the love of sports.

483
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.120
That's why I'm not even on Insta
with the foxes.

484
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.880
You don't follow them?
No. Because of Steffel.

485
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:20.120
They don't follow you either.

486
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.960
Yes, such an insulted-sausage act.

487
00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.360
A win-win situation.
No matter.

488
00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.040
Kick him out
and I become chairman.

489
00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:33.160
I can't kick my president
out. You have seen,

490
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.680
what abilities the man has.

491
00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.840
You must apologize
and revise.

492
00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.320
Are you already at the end?
I can't apologize,

493
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:46.040
because the show is over.
You're not serious.

494
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:50.480
It was nice, wasn't it?
Did you feel screwed?

495
00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.840
Is the show really over?
Sure, what did you think?

496
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.120
You're breaking up so abruptly?
Sure.

497
00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.520
So not with you.
I know you differently.

498
00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:01.120
* (BURPS)
Oh... * (LAUGHING)

499
00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:04.960
A kebab came up.
Come.

500
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:07.520
A little in the mouth.
Stop.

501
00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:11.440
Dude...
We are coming out now.

502
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:18.800
Do we touch each other?
Of course. We are in love, after all.

503
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:22.960
See. B, Puma for Saxony.
Stand there.

504
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.400
So.
Ladies and gentlemen,

505
00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.240
I am now
the new chairman of the foxes.

506
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:32.880
Mr. Kretzsche promised.
What you promise, you keep.

507
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.280
I can't offer you the job as president
as president...

508
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.440
I gladly accept and ...
* Laughter *

509
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.360
With God's help
we will manage everything.

510
00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:44.720
Where will the foxes be in four years?

511
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.560
With you or without you?
* (LAUGHING)

512
00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:51.600
With you we probably stagger
in the second league,

513
00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:55.120
without you it could be
Champions League without you. * (LAUGHING)

514
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.720
That's a wicked conclusion.

515
00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.520
I had planned a different conclusion
planned ... What?

516
00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.400

[HORN HONKING] * Laughter *

517
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.600
Congratulations on the last show,
I actually wanted to say.

518
00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:12.160
* Clapping * When three people
clap, it sucked.

519
00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.720
* Did you have
the applause already?

520
00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.920
These are the three,
that we have paid for.

521
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:22.520
* (applause)
Stop it now! You're standing out.

522
00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.600
I have always loved you.
Goodbye, neighbors.

523
00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:29.440
* Applause *
* Music *
