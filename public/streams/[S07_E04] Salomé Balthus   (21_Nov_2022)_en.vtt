.

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.320
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.720
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.000
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.640
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.200
Hanna Lakomy alias Salome Balthus.

7
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.400
(French pronunciation) Balthus.
Please?

8
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.000
Balthus. - Wait,
I haven't pressed yet. Please?

9
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.200
Balthus. That's a painter,
you don't need to know.

10
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.000
Balthus, right.

11
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.960
Let's cut out. It looks like
I don't know the names of the guests.

12
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.720
Hanna Lakomy alias Salome Balthus,
ne.

13
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.240
The U is namely pronounced as Ü.

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.680
38 years old, prostitute,
columnist and author.

15
00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.000
Before I make the second mistake,
Mrs. Balthus:

16
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.760
Do you say "prostitute"
or "whore"?

17
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.080
The legislator
says "prostitute".

18
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.600
I have no objection to that.

19
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.360
But "whore" would also work?
Yeah, sure.

20
00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.080
Can we agree on "whore"?
That's such officialese:

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.760
"Prostitute"
sounds like residents' registration office.

22
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.120
Are you still there?
I am whore.

23
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.320
Please? - You can say "whore."
Do you hear me?

24
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.120
Oh, we're already on a first-name basis, are we?
Excuse me, Mr. Krömer.

25
00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.920
What do you think about
me coming in?

26
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.800
Over the intercom is silly.
Just as you like, Mr. Krömer.

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.440
You tell me.
* (CLEARS THROAT)

28
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.840
Sorry, Balthus of course.

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.560
Balthus, whose name was actually
Balthasar Klossowski.

30
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.920
Balthasar Klossowski de Rola,
and called himself Balthus.

31
00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.400
Do you want a coke? - No, then
I have to go to the bathroom again.

32
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.960
After.
Yes? Is Cherry Coke light.

33
00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.080
I have never drunk it. Does
this? - Yes, I love it.

34
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.840
Really? Shall I try it?
Yes, try it.

35
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.880
We can cut that,
when you go to the bathroom.

36
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.640
"Sex worker" is also still said,
but I think that's so ...

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.400
Sounds like work, doesn't it?
No, so German.

38
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.640
So I understand why you would ...
Registration Office, Ordnungsamt. "Attention!"

39
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.400
I understand why the term
the term. I do not need it.

40
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.720
Good, so for now ...

41
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.600
By the way
very nice tie pattern.

42
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.600
Yes? Yes, thank you.

43
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.520
I am a trained men's outfitter.

44
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.360
Have you locked up?
Are we at the you?

45
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.440
Excuse me.
We can be on first name terms.

46
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200
Watch out, now it's about
about the topic of prostitution.

47
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.280
Now it is clear to me for the time being ... I
am not making fun of you.

48
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.080
There are now
no ficki ficki jokes.

49
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.360
I also want
do not make a consternation shit

50
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.320
and I don't want it to be a quota thing,
that I say:

51
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.680
We invite a prostitute
then we will click properly.

52
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.840
I see. - I always invite
Assholes and friends.

53
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.000
I don't know who I am.
Nah, watch it.

54
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.400
The theme today is the asshole.

55
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.880
The subject
is a real asshole.

56
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.480
And we're going to look into that now.
So, watch out.

57
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.640
After the Abi you/they
got directly on the wrong track

58
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.560
and have studied philosophy.

59
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.400
Unfortunately, that's true.
Does that help professionally?

60
00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.640
Not at all.

61
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.760
But it's fun and the best part
about it are the fellow students

62
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.680
and the parties,
that one celebrates.

63
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.920
Philosophy is not a study at all ...
No, it's an attitude to life.

64
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.320
I still studied master's degree.
That's a lot of studying at home, huh?

65
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.240
The Bachelor students
had to perform

66
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.920
and always be at the university.

67
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.160
We didn't have to.
We had to ...

68
00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.600
show up for the exam,
had no obligations.

69
00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.440
There are many opinions
about prostitution.

70
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.600
You make it sound quite different.

71
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.080
You spoke
about it in an interview with SWR,

72
00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.520
that whores for you
always had something mystical.

73
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.640
That's rather unusual, isn't it?
I see. - Why mystical?

74
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.920
I cannot estimate what is
is mystical for other people.

75
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.680
I always found these characters
in literary history always

76
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.280
romantic, mystical, mysterious.

77
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.280
I found
"The Lady of the Camellias" exciting,

78
00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.000
or "Nana",
or even the women who ...

79
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.200
I don't know them at all, I was
I was only at school for ten years.

80
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.720
Can still be read,
is well written. - Good.

81
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.400
Also for the intelligent students,
who did not like school.

82
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.200
The most intelligent are those,
who can't cope with school.

83
00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.240
Oh, then I'm ... (laughs)
I am convinced of it.

84
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.680
I left after elementary school
because I was highly gifted.

85
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.160
Theme mystical: Her parents are
or were both artists,

86
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.800
namely Monika Erhard
and Reinhard Lakomy,

87
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.720
in the GDR
and later also in the FRG

88
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.520
especially through the "Dream Magic Tree".
known.

89
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.200
East Berlin after the Wende
and artist parents:

90
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.680
Could you do as a child,
what you wanted?

91
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.560
I absolutely could not do
what I wanted, was overprotected.

92
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.040
That's why it was a liberation,
to dive into a world,

93
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.560
where I was not "daughter of
and my last name was of no use,

94
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:16.960
where my parents and my name
nobody knew.

95
00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.480
It was for me
absolute freedom,

96
00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.720
the most beautiful years of my life.

97
00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.200
How did you get into prostitution?
How did you get the idea?

98
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.880
I needed the money.
I knew it was legal.

99
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:30.480
Finance your studies?
At least the end.

100
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.680
I had a scholarship before that,
but I studied longer,

101
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.440
because I was too interested.

102
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.280
And I wanted to move out
and be independent.

103
00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.760
I always thought,
if I don't like it,

104
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.320
I can stop at any time,
and so it was.

105
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:48.240
For the first job
you got 3,000 euros right away?

106
00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.920
This is so common, yes,
because sometime overnight.

107
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.840
Whereby ...
Overnight means: overnight?

108
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.280
Yes, although ...
But 3,000 euros is already ...

109
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.360
I had another colleague with me.

110
00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.840
The guy paid
paid 3,000 for each of us,

111
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.120
so 6.000,
and the agency got 30%.

112
00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:08.720
Only for the fact that she once
she picked up the phone, she got 2,000.

113
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.880
But 3,000 euros is a lot, isn't it?
I thought so too.

114
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.000
This is not for Helmut,
the bricklayer.

115
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.960
I thought so too,
but that was a fact.

116
00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.160
I thought I'd rather do it
less often for more money

117
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.080
than more often for less.

118
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.360
That's escort then?
Yes, you know?

119
00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.040
Uh, you know.
Go ahead and say you.

120
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.960
It's such an intimate subject.
I went to a whorehouse once.

121
00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.200
Which one? - It was in Cologne,
I can't remember. I was 17.

122
00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.160
That's too young.
I found that quite terrible.

123
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.680
That can be.
The willy did not become stiff.

124
00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.720
I did not come,
I was drunk and ashamed.

125
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.920
Didn't the woman do anything
to make you feel better?

126
00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:55.000
The lady was good, but I found myself
so disgusting in this situation.

127
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:59.240
That I'm lying there drunk ...
But then that's not up to you.

128
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.600
There is nothing wrong with being drunk.

129
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.760
And not getting it up
is also quite normal.

130
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.360
Yes, but I found ...
I really ...

131
00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.920
I swear
on the eyesight of my children,

132
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.320
that I was once in the whorehouse ...
Do you have it one size smaller?

133
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:19.600
That I can't sleep with a woman
sleep when I do not realize,

134
00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:22.320
she thinks I'm hot, too,
she's up for it.

135
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.800
But there are already women
that I know, and me too,

136
00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.080
who find the people they meet
also find sympathetic and hot.

137
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.120
You can design it yourself.

138
00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.800
In such a brothel
it is certainly more difficult,

139
00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:39.000
because the atmosphere is very different.

140
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.320
How did you explain
to your parents and friends?

141
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.960
Is that what you told them?

142
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.080
I told everyone,
because I wanted to provoke.

143
00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.760
Not to my father.

144
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:52.080
He died quickly and
I had no more opportunity.

145
00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.920
He didn't know that?
No.

146
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.680
What would he have said?
I don't know.

147
00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:00.440
I suppose he would have had
a big problem with it in the beginning.

148
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:04.440
He would have been upset,
then I would have talked to him.

149
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.880
Then he might have
bragged about it.

150
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:11.120
I can't assess it.
I do not want to talk about him.

151
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.200
But my mother
supports me in this.

152
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.720
For my acquaintances from
East Germany, this is not a problem.

153
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:20.360
Not West Germany?

154
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:24.560
I have few family acquaintances
from West Germany and ...

155
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.880
But you've been out west before?

156
00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.040
I'm in the West right now.

157
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:31.640
Well, but you are here
in the Shire West.

158
00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.560
This is Masurenallee,
here they still pay with DM.

159
00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.880
I live in Neukölln.
In Neukölln?

160
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:39.680
That is so West.
You can't get more western than that.

161
00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:41.320
I live in ... * Beep *

162
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.080
I used to live there, too.
Which street then?

163
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.640
* Beep *
Oh, no. * Beep *

164
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.880
I live... * Beep *
Is near. - Parallel.

165
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.120
But we do not want
become too private.

166
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:54.160
I have an educational mission.

167
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:59.160
In 2016 you founded your own
escort agency "Hetaera".

168
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.000
The cheapest rate with you
is 1,000 euros for two hours.

169
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:05.080
That's a lot of wood.

170
00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.360
We have reconciled the prices.

171
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:10.440
We have looked
what other agencies charge

172
00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.120
and of course the most expensive taken,
what goes.

173
00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.360
6,000 euros for 48 hours.
Well, who has so long time ...

174
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:21.720
But what distinguishes
sex for 6,000 euros from the ...

175
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.400
What is standard?

176
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:26.200
It is not clear
that sex exists at all.

177
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.080
I see. How?

178
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:31.640
We do not guarantee anything,
except that it is consensual.

179
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.040
I'll have a chat with you then?

180
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:37.680
What happens is what happens
and what we both feel comfortable with.

181
00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.600
Do you manipulate the men in such a way
that no sex comes?

182
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:42.960
On the contrary, I like sex.

183
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.760
But you do not force it,
the time is paid.

184
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.400
In this way I guarantee
our customers,

185
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.040
there are also women,

186
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.320
that it is consensual
and they do not have the feeling

187
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.800
that they are coerced
or forced.

188
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:59.320
And to some, it's worth the money.

189
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.280
Your agency should be an example
of fair prostitution.

190
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:08.360
What does fair mean?
Fair means for me,

191
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:13.040
that the woman has all the possibilities
has to realize herself

192
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:17.800
and to organize their work in such a way
that she alone determines.

193
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.840
The only ones who still have a say
are those from the tax office

194
00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.560
and those of the law.

195
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:28.680
But that no one
interferes with the woman,

196
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.880
that she can shape her work,
can do what she wants,

197
00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:34.960
can leave immediately,
if she wants to.

198
00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:37.680
Self-determination is a big issue.

199
00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.040
If you look at prostitution,
there is often nothing about self-determination.

200
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:47.040
Many women do not know at all
what self-determination means.

201
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.320
Many believe,
it would be an employee job and ...

202
00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.600
I think many of my female colleagues
do not know their rights.

203
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.000
As an agency manager, do you get
the 30% now,

204
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.040
that were taken away from you back then?

205
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.680
I do not take commission.

206
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.320
I have a portal, the women
get the requests directly.

207
00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.920
I don't earn anything with it.
Nothing? - No.

208
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.840
I earn with my own customers.

209
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.920
Because it's so expensive with the 1,000
and 6,000 euros? - Well, I ...

210
00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:21.480
Do you have a concession for trade,
the so-called whore pass? - No.

211
00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.480
Also German again: the
legal registration certificate.

212
00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.680
Indeed, I do not have them
and do not want to.

213
00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.240
Are you illegal then, or what?
Actually yes.

214
00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:36.760
I think so ... - Fortunately
we don't broadcast that here.

215
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.200
I find
this certificate of registration ...

216
00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.080
I have the feeling
this is unconstitutional.

217
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:45.520
I know friends and lawyers
who are also of the opinion.

218
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.880
I have an imprint, my name
and a commercial register number.

219
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.000
If a German official in 20 min
in a conversation wants to determine,

220
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.120
whether I am
am suitable for this job ...

221
00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:58.520
She can't assess that.

222
00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:01.520
She should send me the cardboard
or turn me in.

223
00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.880
If they press charges, I'll
a precedent and sue.

224
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.680
I do not think that the
Ordnungsamt is interested in me.

225
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.600
Are you speaking for prostitution
in general or just for you?

226
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:20.920
I speak only for myself, but know,
how many others feel.

227
00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.120
I don't want to speak for them,
they could also be asked.

228
00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:29.600
Yes. We have a player
from a dropout. - Oh.

229
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.600
Huschke Mau or Sandra Norak?
She would like to remain anonymous. - Okay.

230
00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.920
I noticed at the
noticed at the editorial meeting,

231
00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:41.000
that I'm completely leaving my area of expertise
as a comedian completely.

232
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.440
I do not find it funny today,
nor do I have the intention,

233
00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.920
that I somehow
want to be funny.

234
00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.320
But I'm not a journalist either.

235
00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.080
I didn't know
that you wanted to be a comedian.

236
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.800
I always thought you were an actor,
you were an actor. - No.

237
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:57.800
I would like to be,
but it doesn't work out.

238
00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.800
Let's take a look at the lady.

239
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.080
I grew up in poverty.

240
00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.280
I was
abused as a child and teenager

241
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:11.440
and have as a teenager
already secured my survival in this way,

242
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:16.320
by getting food
for sexual favors.

243
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:22.480
Therefore, the step into prostitution
into prostitution was not difficult.

244
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.080
The celebration
have sometimes brought drugs,

245
00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.200
Alcohol was already part of the good tone.

246
00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:30.600
I was threatened
and raped several times.

247
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.440
Um...
Yes, but that's part of it somehow.

248
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:40.080
I don't know any woman who hasn't
experienced this. Occupational hazard, so to speak.

249
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.680
She says rape and violence
are part of it.

250
00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.920
There is hardly a prostitute
who has not experienced this.

251
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:51.600
You can see how little the women
know their rights or laws.

252
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.840
None of this is legal,
these are serious crimes.

253
00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.080
But the law can yes there ...
Does the law do anything?

254
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:02.760
The implementation is the question.
Will the ladies be seen in public?

255
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.400
They exist,
but no one talks about them.

256
00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.040
Most of them do not dare
to come out of the closet.

257
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:11.920
There are of course
a few aid organizations.

258
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.360
Some are from the church,
which are pure exit programs.

259
00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:19.520
There are a few,
e.g. the "Hydra" in Berlin,

260
00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.720
who also really
do good streetwork.

261
00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:24.480
This is a social problem.

262
00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.880
I would like to say to the woman:
Everything that happened to you,

263
00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:31.080
is not prostitution,
but sexual violence.

264
00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.920
But it's ... - Well, prostitution
maybe not, sex work...

265
00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.360
But I think that's everyday life.
Yes, that's right.

266
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.040
I don't know,

267
00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.960
how many escort agencies
there are in Germany,

268
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.880
but rumor has it that it is 2%,
and 98% are the ladies ...

269
00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:51.680
I don't know that myself,
no one knows.

270
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.920
The percentages are sometimes from the EMMA
freely invented, sometimes there ...

271
00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.640
Nowhere are they occupied.

272
00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.960
Even if we say it's 90%,
who are raped, that's...

273
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.960
I don't think that's true.
Let it be 50%, bad enough.

274
00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:10.000
Then the question is, why don't
these women not have the opportunity,

275
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.520
to say:
I'm going to stop doing this right now?

276
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.280
Economic constraints.

277
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.600
I think many women say:
I have no education,

278
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.640
No job or debt.

279
00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.640
How bad must wage labor be,

280
00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.680
that women do this,
because otherwise they would not have a job ...

281
00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:28.840
Or how bad
family conditions have to be?

282
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.920
My only reaction to that was,
to start my own store,

283
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.680
where I have working conditions
that I would have liked to have had myself.

284
00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.880
I.e. complete self-determination,
no taxes whatsoever,

285
00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.160
no commission either,
that one thinks:

286
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.880
If I do not accept this customer
the agency gets annoyed.

287
00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:49.800
I wanted to avoid that, too.

288
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.920
And as much as possible
communication and co-determination.

289
00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:57.120
We have another film.

290
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:01.040
The dropout
speaks of health consequences,

291
00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.320
that remain even after the exit.

292
00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.000
Many of my colleagues were
alcoholic, drank a lot.

293
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.800
There were also
other drugs were consumed.

294
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.800
I have post-traumatic stress
stress disorder.

295
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.600
I have recurrent depression
and anxiety.

296
00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:21.080
I have a massive problem
to trust.

297
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.080
I can no longer see my way through.

298
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.440
There are feminists
who want to ban prostitution,

299
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.120
and those who consider it an act of
of self-determination.

300
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.040
Can you explain that to me?

301
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.640
The feminists,
who want to ban prostitution,

302
00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:41.760
are the same ones who also
want to ban the headscarf

303
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:45.320
or who are e.g. also
are against transwomen.

304
00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.520
I don't know why,
but it's the same intersection.

305
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.280
I know this by now
from activism and through Twitter.

306
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.480
I always wanted
always tell these women:

307
00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.800
You could also make a
self-determined job out of it,

308
00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:02.720
where we determine what the men
do with us. Or even the women.

309
00:17:02.880 --> 00:17:05.600
We are
the masters of our sexuality.

310
00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:09.520
They were never open to it
and have always demonized it.

311
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:13.760
At some point I would have had the feeling
that, without my ...

312
00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.800
I am not alcoholic,
Thank God.

313
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.560
I know people outside of prostitution
prostitution who are dry.

314
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:23.160
This is
a matter for society as a whole.

315
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.040
I am also a dry alcoholic
for 12 years. - I know

316
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.680
This is popping up all over the place,

317
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.720
but not all of those who feel this way
are prostitutes.

318
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:35.120
Why is it
seen in this way with the range?

319
00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:39.320
Well, because the vast majority
in Germany really ...

320
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.360
What numbers,
who collected them?

321
00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:44.320
As I said, I do not want to say
say anything at all ...

322
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.920
It's already ... - It may be,
but what do you do then?

323
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:51.720
You'd have to make it possible
that they could find a similarly paid

324
00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.680
and have safe alternative,
earn money.

325
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.440
Or we look at how we can make prostitution
safer and better?

326
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.880
What should
the working conditions be?

327
00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.360
For this I would like to
come into the conversation.

328
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:09.400
Many say, for example, prostitution,
when 98% of the time it's like that,

329
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:13.520
That it is criminalized,
that women are raped:

330
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.480
that it should be completely abolished,

331
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.240
that the kind of prostitution
that you offer, also be abolished.

332
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.000
Then this fair way
would not remain.

333
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.760
What happened to the woman, that
we noticed in the lockdown ...

334
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:29.680
The illegal red light industry
then has the monopoly,

335
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.320
it happens one way or another.

336
00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:35.160
I'm going to give them competition.
Believe me, they don't like me.

337
00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.560
So, of course, the customer side.

338
00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.880
If someone is looking for it,
he finds legal offers.

339
00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.560
If he does not find them, he must
look for illegal offers.

340
00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.520
If only the customers remain,
who are also willing,

341
00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:53.120
committing crimes, those are the ones,
that we would have rejected before.

342
00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.000
I would rather
sleep with the customers,

343
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:58.080
who do not want to commit a crime.

344
00:18:58.240 --> 00:19:01.960
Like the nice man today.
Do I have a hickey? All right.

345
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:04.720
Hickey?
Yes, it was two hours ago.

346
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.280
So it wasn't just talk today?
No.

347
00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.480
Anyway
these are people with me,

348
00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.560
who before
could never have imagined,

349
00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.440
to book escorts
or to go to the whorehouse.

350
00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.240
These are people who
have seen through my website:

351
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:21.200
Oh, if that's how it works ...

352
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.880
You meant
after a long e-mail exchange:

353
00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.360
If it's so self-determined,
maybe it's something.

354
00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.360
They stay pretty faithful, too.

355
00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:31.800
Sure, I'd be in favor of that, too,
that one says:

356
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:34.360
What you are doing
should be legal.

357
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.560
The other should be banned.
It already is.

358
00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.760
But I can already hear the people
who are shaking their heads.

359
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:45.080
But everything is forbidden
that is violent.

360
00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:49.160
According to the German Civil Code, sex work is
Code of Civil Law.

361
00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.960
I.e., even if there were
there would be an employer,

362
00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.400
he must not give instructions,
he must not say:

363
00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:58.480
"Sleep with that, don't be like that."
This is forbidden.

364
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:00.800
What would you say ...

365
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.200
Suppose,
we now have a brothel,

366
00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:06.880
which is state-run.
State-run?

367
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.000
Would something like that work?
It would be expensive for the state.

368
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.200
"Prostitution may only
take place in these houses."

369
00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:15.200
There are some precedents there,

370
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:17.880
the church has
in the High Middle Ages also ...

371
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:21.200
It would then probably be
that one says,

372
00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:23.800
all must be healthy and ...

373
00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:28.160
the prices are
set by the women themselves.

374
00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.600
They can set their own prices
and working hours.

375
00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.840
They can come there
when they want.

376
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400
I would say,
there should be in the same house also

377
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.960
Training centers
for further education give

378
00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.200
and maybe
childcare during the day.

379
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:45.160
I would even say ...
Is that realistic?

380
00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.360
It is pure utopia.
Tastes good.

381
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:51.800
On the subject of feminism:
The association SISTERS e.V.

382
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:56.640
has helped women to leave
from prostitution.

383
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.000
Their opinion is as follows.

384
00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.360
For us prostitution is
not a feminist act.

385
00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.840
It is exclusively
about the sexuality of the man.

386
00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.600
We see prostitution as violence
by men against women.

387
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.400
Violence is the everyday life of women.

388
00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.640
It goes off
with insults and threats ...

389
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.400
on to physical violence.

390
00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.440
These can be blows,
kicks, choking, biting,

391
00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.840
scratching and it also leads
to severe physical violence.

392
00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.600
In Berlin
several times a week

393
00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.160
to the violence protection outpatient clinic
of the Charite

394
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.480
Women incarcerated with severe
physical abuse,

395
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.360
they have experienced through johns or pimps.
have experienced.

396
00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:49.560
I once had
a podcast with a colleague,

397
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.720
where we had a nurse
from the Charite.

398
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.520
She also said, without irony,
she didn't mean it as a joke:

399
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.160
that the ladies
are patched up there,

400
00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:05.760
that downstairs in front of the front door
is already the pimp.

401
00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.280
And all know:
Okay, in one hour ...

402
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:11.440
Why is the man not arrested?

403
00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:14.520
Because it cannot be
cannot be proven.

404
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.880
The woman can
make a witness statement.

405
00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.720
But if it is forced?

406
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.880
That is the thing,
and no authority helps there either...

407
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:28.240
She is kidnapped, her passport is
passport taken away and told:

408
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:32.480
"You'll get your passport back..,
until you buy me 10,000 euros."

409
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.240
That's all illegal.
That is illegal, yes.

410
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.240
I would have otherwise always said,
that's all illegal.

411
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.560
I am really interested in the topic
and I would ask

412
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.440
Why can't anything be done about it?
It is so obvious.

413
00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.240
The guy is standing there, there are witnesses,
and if it's not the wife,

414
00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:54.000
then there are the nurses.
Why aren't there any ...

415
00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.120
Because they don't dare.
Who doesn't dare?

416
00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:01.000
Domestic violence, have you never
you've never heard of that? - What are they afraid of?

417
00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.200
Have you never heard that a woman
will beat ten years at home?

418
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.760
Everyone thinks:
Why do you stay with that bum?

419
00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:11.520
Marriage is not forbidden there either.
She is afraid.

420
00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.080
She is afraid
that she is being pursued by him.

421
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:17.000
There are too few women's shelters,
and those that do exist,

422
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.320
should also accept migrant women,
even without a passport.

423
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:23.040
Then the question is:
How can this be at all?

424
00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.080
There is a woman who does not have
that is somewhere else.

425
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:31.000
When she arrives at the hospital,
why isn't there a task force,

426
00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:33.520
that gets the woman her passport?

427
00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.240
Because she does not dare.

428
00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.840
She does not have to dare, she is
safe in the hospital.

429
00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.760
I have to assume that you are
you are a bit unworldly.

430
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.760
Maybe that's me, because it's
really not my world.

431
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.840
I am just as much
a TV viewer like you. - Mhm.

432
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.960
What should I do?

433
00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:56.080
Except that I have created my own
Working conditions created.

434
00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.560
But that is
a world of difference.

435
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.440
Yes, that's right. - We have A here
and here C, and B is gone.

436
00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:06.360
When I relate this
to the retail sector,

437
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.600
there is not only
the jeans for 500 euros,

438
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:13.480
and not only those sewn by little
children from Bangladesh,

439
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.320
but there is in the middle
another one for 100 euros.

440
00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.120
This also exists
in prostitution.

441
00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:21.800
Do you want addresses or what?

442
00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:27.400
No, I just want to say that there is
not only expensive and cheap. - Sure.

443
00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:30.960
And I find,
that also in the legal area ...

444
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:34.600
There, too, I have personally
black sheep,

445
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:37.440
that just by,
that they tell the women:

446
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.440
"You don't need a tax return,
no invoice.

447
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.280
You only have to offset the amount
that you keep", which is wrong ...

448
00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:47.240
The leave
women their tax burden

449
00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:50.480
and don't inform them.
There's a lot of shit there.

450
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:52.520
How long have you been doing this job?

451
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.200
How long can
or do you want to do this?

452
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.800
I've been doing this since December 2011 ...
No, 2010.

453
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.760
So for over ten years.

454
00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:05.000
I haven't found a hook yet,
no reason to stop.

455
00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.240
I have a lot of regular customers
whom I would like to see again.

456
00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.680
All right, my questions are through.

457
00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:18.160
Now I ask you: Do you feel
I'm bullshitting you?

458
00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.640
No, why?
I just know...

459
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:26.640
The format has half an hour.
We now have 2.5 minutes left.

460
00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:31.360
Has that done anything now?
Do we have any insight now?

461
00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:36.000
Can we give a hint
how we do that with the brothel?

462
00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:39.960
As I said, I have created my own
working conditions.

463
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:41.840
Others should do the same.

464
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.440
Women should firstly
obtain information from counseling centers,

465
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:49.560
what rights they have and, if possible,
if possible, become independent.

466
00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:51.720
Many do not know the language at all.

467
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.360
They don't know German
and do not know ...

468
00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.240
There are in the counseling centers

469
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:58.840
Language mediators
in 50 different languages.

470
00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.560
From Romanian to Thai, Farsi
they have everything.

471
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.640
Is there anything we can fade in,
where a woman can turn?

472
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:11.320
Yes, the website of the Hydra
or from the professional association sex work.

473
00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:15.320
Okay,
whether the ones it affects

474
00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.080
Krömer look.

475
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:21.400
Maybe someone will see it
and passes it on.

476
00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.600
Maybe some customers will see it.

477
00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:26.480
The customers,
who see this and go somewhere

478
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:28.240
and have the feeling that ...

479
00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:31.040
What kind of customers are they?
Quite different.

480
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.400
Everyone is?
Everyone, really everyone.

481
00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.120
Just as any woman can be.

482
00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.000
For men, I would say:

483
00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:41.720
out of 100 people
105 do not talk about it,

484
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.160
that they do that?
Absolutely.

485
00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:46.760
Most men
are not evil after all.

486
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.200
There are also very few sadists.

487
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:50.840
When they feel that,

488
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000
the woman cannot
not articulate, has a problem,

489
00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:59.720
they should give this woman an info
where she can get information.

490
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:04.160
Maybe look:
Does she even have her own cell phone?

491
00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.480
Otherwise, give her an address.

492
00:27:06.640 --> 00:27:09.760
By the way, the Hydra is
in Neukölln at Hermannplatz.

493
00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.120
That is totally low-threshold and
they speak different languages.

494
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.320
And if someone notices
that in the apartment next door

495
00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:23.920
illegal prostitution is offered
is that one also denounces.

496
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.000
Ultimately, the only way to help women
only help as a customer, I think.

497
00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:33.440
I would also say that you should
have the responsibility as a customer,

498
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.080
to be empathic.

499
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.120
Who was I sleeping with?
Who am I meeting right now?

500
00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:42.280
Perhaps for some
also the fetish,

501
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.720
to pretend
as if they were completely helpless.

502
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.680
You never know.
That's a very tricky thing.

503
00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:51.120
It's good to build trust.
Would you say men ...

504
00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.520
Are they all perverts,
live out things with prostitutes,

505
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:56.760
they do not dare
with the woman do not dare?

506
00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.600
You live ... - Or is that
Flower sex, vanilla sex?

507
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:05.040
It is unfortunately mostly
flower and vanilla sex,

508
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.080
more longing for closeness and warmth,
not to be herself above all,

509
00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.840
that nobody
knows their skeletons in the closet.

510
00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Thank you. - Union
agreed working time.

511
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.000
You can call me Hanna.
Hanna? Okay.

512
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.000
Well, I thank you
and ...

513
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.360
Take care, neighbors.

514
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.360
