.

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.920
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.400
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.960
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.280
Ah!

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.040
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.920
Torsten Sträter, 54 years old,
host of the show "Sträter".

8
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.640
* heavy breathing *

9
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.120
Mr. Sträter?
Yes.

10
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.720
You are 55 years old?
Almost.

11
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.480
Can I say you?
Because I am younger.

12
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.440
Yes, with pleasure.

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.920
You, Torsten, yes? - Mhm.

14
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.960
Or can I say "pie"?

15
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.840
No. - Okay.

16
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.720
* nasty laugh *

17
00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.760
All right, let's do this.
* (clears throat)

18
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.760
So.

19
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.360
(coughs) Well ...
Good morning, Torsten.

20
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.120
Hi Kurt.

21
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.560
Drinks you have?
Drinks I have, wonderful. Thank you.

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.200
So.

23
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.920
You have the very successful
show "Sträter".

24
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.120
I do not know how successful,
but I have the show.

25
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.640
I went again last night

26
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.960
the last 30 years
gone through in my diary

27
00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.280
and have seen
that I have never been there.

28
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.680
That's right. - I haven't
not received an invitation yet.

29
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.400
Yes. Do you know why?
Why?

30
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.600
I always have a lot to do with
who is invited.

31
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.600
Oh, I see, you are the determiner,

32
00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.320
who could say:
"My buddy from Berlin!"

33
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.000
We didn't dare,

34
00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:56.280
because some people don't like
a rejection from some people. - Why?

35
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.360
Because then I am unnecessarily offended.

36
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.960
People I appreciate,
can also sometimes not.

37
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.880
I then think:
"This must have something to do with me."

38
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.960
I'm weird that way. - But that I
30 years sitting at home and thinking

39
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.280
"When do I get the invitation?" ...
Have you thought of that?

40
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.480
That hurts me, too,
when I am not invited.

41
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.720
I don't even have the chance
to cancel.

42
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.280
I would like the chance,
to say:

43
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.760
"Thank you for the invitation, but
maybe I'm not up for it."

44
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.680
29 years are on me,
I've been doing it since last year.

45
00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.160
From now on.
It's about many other shows.

46
00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.160
You are also representative
for many TV formats,

47
00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.520
where I was not invited.
This is the first time for me.

48
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.800
I cordially invite you.
I do not feel like it anymore.

49
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.600
That is exactly always the.

50
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.840
This is even worse
than by e-mail.

51
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.800
Do you know why I'm not coming?
I know this.

52
00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.240
When you do
do a show like you do:

53
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.840
The best always come to the beginning.

54
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.640
No. - You're probably already
at one point,

55
00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.240
where you tell your editors:
Now we take idiots. - No.

56
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.600
Then my phone rings.
That would be so cool.

57
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.120
Radio Rainbow Award,
do you know it?

58
00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.840
Who? - Radio Regenbogen Award,
somewhere Baden-Württemberg.

59
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.160
Is me ... No,
but it sounds charming. - Watch out.

60
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:19.520
They wanted to give me the price
and then I had a look.

61
00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.760
50 comedians have already been there,
the last 30 you don't even know.

62
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.640
When the fact is: "Now we'll take
the idiot Knut Knödel from Berlin."

63
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.640
* (LAUGHING)
What are you laughing at?

64
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.920
It's in the on, you carrion.

65
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.760
What are you laughing up there now?

66
00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.960
That's often the case with prices.
We'll start again.

67
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.600
Why? - Because Ingrid
laughed in. I'm out now.

68
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.880
So I...
* (SIGHS)

69
00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.640
It's very jail-like here.
We'll start again.

70
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.560
I ask, "Why don't you invite me over?"
and you say "Jo."

71
00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.520
Okay.
to your show.

72
00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.360
Jo, with pleasure.
Good.

73
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.240
Here's how it works.

74
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.080
You were born in Dortmund and have
always lived in the Ruhr area. - Yes.

75
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.080
Are you a Ruhrpottler,
through and through? - Yes, I think so.

76
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.200
I don't know exactly.

77
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.840
I get labels like

78
00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.160
"Ambassador of the Ruhr region",
but that's not me.

79
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.280
Why not? - I do not know.

80
00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.360
You are Ruhrpott.

81
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.680
If you want an ambassador,

82
00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.320
you take Herbert Knebel or
other people who have been doing this for a long time.

83
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.680
I am not.
But I live there and ...

84
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.440
Well, I live there, Kurt.
* Laughter *

85
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.320
You have an education
as a men's tailor. - Yes.

86
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.000
Why?
I don't know exactly anymore.

87
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.880
I don't have a pointed answer.
I liked to sew

88
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.120
and am such a costume freak,
a movie costume freak.

89
00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.800
Did you make today's costume
yourself?

90
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.520
This is a shirt...
What action figure does this represent?

91
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.520
That's Fatman.
(laughs) You're not fat.

92
00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.120
I am fat.
Now that's fatphobic.

93
00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:08.400
I beg your pardon?
You're fatphobic. - No.

94
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.080
I have a rejection of my own body fat
towards a rejection.

95
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.680
Discriminating against yourself.
Yes, indeed. - That is not good.

96
00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.640
Too late. - You are not fat.
I am slim like a deer.

97
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.760
Then you switched to sales at the
at the men's outfitter. - Yes.

98
00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.280
Was that fun?
You know, I'm also ... - Yes.

99
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.120
... semi-skilled men's outfitter.

100
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.720
After one year I
successfully dropped out. - Yes? - Yes.

101
00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.480
I am a trained men's outfitter.
What turned you off?

102
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:42.160
I was turned off by the fact that you always had to go
had to go with the fashion.

103
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.360
For 450 marks a month I had to buy
buy everything new four times a year,

104
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.080
was completely in debt with 8 million.
Me too.

105
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.080
I thought:
That is illogical.

106
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.760
Later you earn
2,000 euros gross, or what?

107
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.600
That was too stupid for me. - Me too.

108
00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.360
I was at this
rather expensive men's outfitter,

109
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.800
where at the beginning of the 90s
a suit cost 500 marks.

110
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.480
For me, incomprehensible sums.
That was expensive.

111
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:13.120
There I wore suits
from C&amp;A for 79 marks,

112
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.600
because I thought: I can get away
I can get away with, is work clothes.

113
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.800
But sometimes it was said:
"We've reduced BOSS."

114
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.000
I thought: Fuck, still
too expensive, but let me ...

115
00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.120
Are we allowed to say BOSS,
are we allowed to call it?

116
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.760
Castle, we call it castle.
The fashion company Schloss. - Yes.

117
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.240
So a rather expensive company.

118
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.120
I liked to get into debt
I was happy to go into debt with my employer.

119
00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.160
That was too superficial for me, too.
I was into it.

120
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.880
Then I went into showbiz,
here it's different.

121
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.760
You know, sometimes I miss
the superficiality in showbiz.

122
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.720
You think so?

123
00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.160
It is late, I am not
on irony today.

124
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:58.000
It was a long train ride.

125
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:01.240
Right,
you were split in Hamm, right?

126
00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.800
I was split twice in Hamm.
I still have wound pain.

127
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.440
Don't they know in the Ruhr
that the train is divided?

128
00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.040
Were you on the wrong train?

129
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.880
No, it will not be shared
on the way to Berlin.

130
00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.840
On the way back it is divided,
so that poor souls can go to Cologne

131
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.160
and the others to Düsseldorf.

132
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:25.640
I have never understood
why the train is divided in Hamm.

133
00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:30.280
Where is the other half going?
The earth is a disc.

134
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.000
I am always afraid that
that it will fall into a ravine.

135
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:37.480
I have never heard of people
who were in the other compartment.

136
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:41.040
Where are they? - I'm in the wrong compartment
in the wrong compartment.

137
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.840
As a fat man, I have to run
run. - That is hostile to fat people.

138
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:48.280
Are we allowed to say that? - Say what?
You are not fat.

139
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:50.760
Yes, no,
that's a mathematical thing.

140
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:53.920
I am not fat,
but also not 3.20 m tall,

141
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:56.280
which would stretch things enormously.

142
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.040
How tall are you?
Are you standing or sitting now?

143
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.240
(laughs) Ah, don't laugh.

144
00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:04.800
Just a question,
I do not see that.

145
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.360
I am 1.80 m
and should weigh 85 kg.

146
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.960
The table is 1.75 m high.
Yes, in fact I am standing.

147
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.880
Yes, we are both standing.
We are both standing. - A high table.

148
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.880
One would like behind this disc
say things like:

149
00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.600
"Tell Pauly to manage the neighborhood
for me,

150
00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:25.440
Until I'm out again."

151
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.040
You can't help it.
Yes.

152
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.120
Or, I don't know ...

153
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:35.040
Hand over cigarettes.
Four stamps at 80, please.

154
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.880
So, watch out.

155
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.640
After that you worked
worked in a forwarding agency.

156
00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:44.640
You say you were in the office as a man
without a real function. - Mhm.

157
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.160
What was the matter?
Oh, I was unemployed.

158
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.080
The company I was with
had gone bankrupt.

159
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.600
I had a phase of
of disorientation in 2000.

160
00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:00.240
I'm still going to tell the story, right?
Yes, we'll cut me in.

161
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.720
Then my mother
hired me, which was fatal.

162
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.000
Your mother? - She has a
a large freight forwarding company, and so does my brother.

163
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:12.480
There I worked as a kind of
bizarre will-o'-the-wisp, factotum,

164
00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.800
as a man for everything,
but could do nothing.

165
00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.160
I could not remember
remember the simplest tour plan.

166
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.520
What was the deciding factor,
to become an artist?

167
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.960
That was late for you,
at 40 or so. - Exactly.

168
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.040
But it was, after all.
That's what I'm pulling myself up by.

169
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.680
After all, it was.
Let's take a break.

170
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.600
We have one thing in common.

171
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.160
Namely, we both have ...

172
00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:41.080
I have a stomach ache today,
Afraid to talk about it.

173
00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:45.040
The topic of depression. - Why are you
are you afraid to talk about it?

174
00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:48.440
Because I have never
spoken about it publicly.

175
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.840
We both had
severe depression. - Yes.

176
00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.480
We have. So did you.
I have now...

177
00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.080
I spent eight weeks last fall
eight weeks in a clinic,

178
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.200
because I was no longer viable.
Yes.

179
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.120
Because nothing else worked.
Yes.

180
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.480
What was that like for you?

181
00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.040
Now is good,
because the depression is gone.

182
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:14.960
But I'm in a phase
where I get up every day and think:

183
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.240
Shit, I'm not in such a good mood.

184
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.200
It stays like that for quite a long time.
You wait for it to tip over at noon.

185
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.200
Until someone says, "No, you're just
you're just having a shitty day." - Yes.

186
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.720
For example:
This condition is depressing,

187
00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.480
but it's not your depression.

188
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.480
Melancholy-Depression.
Being sad.

189
00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.960
Be sad. - Being shitty.
You are permanently in a waiting position.

190
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.520
I think that sounds now
so solemnly ass-kissing ...

191
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.840
The fact that you said that
made everything else worthwhile,

192
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.200
every journey, every invitation.

193
00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:54.560
Because you are a beacon of hope
for all the others.

194
00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.160
We are now already two,
talking about it.

195
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:00.640
I was researching,
because I thought:

196
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:04.560
"Okay, depression,
you deal with it."

197
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.480
I'm sure there are
other celebrities besides us,

198
00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:10.600
but you were the only one
who popped.

199
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.760
He talks in his program
about it, privately,

200
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:16.720
gives interviews about it.
You are patron ...

201
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:20.680
... of the German Depression League.
Why am I a patron?

202
00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.760
Because Harald Schmidt
is also a patron.

203
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.600
This is Deutsche Depressionshilfe.
German Depression League.

204
00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:30.040
And me too
German Depression League.

205
00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:36.040
Then I always read:
"Depression is a taboo subject!"

206
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.120
Then I thought:
"Yo, your mom is taboo."

207
00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.040
Why?
(laughs) That's right, by the way. - Why?

208
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:48.200
When I now say "I was
depressed," where is the taboo?

209
00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.560
When you say.
"I'm depressed now",

210
00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:54.120
we still don't have a taboo.
It simply isn't one.

211
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.120
But what happens?
Nothing happens only with us,

212
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.640
because we are freelancers,
artists, have a fan base?

213
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:04.880
Would it be different if I
I worked for a government agency

214
00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.800
And would tell my boss?
I think so.

215
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.440
You will always find
always find nutcases who say:

216
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.760
"You have to open windows
and go for a walk!"

217
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.760
And people want to help you,
but can't,

218
00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.440
because professionals are meant
to help us.

219
00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.080
And you will always find people
who say, "You're faking.

220
00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:28.680
For two weeks
you've had a sick bill.

221
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:32.040
The land registry office Hückeswagen
does not run itself!"

222
00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.280
That's just the stigma.

223
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:37.400
People prefer to see
a cast up to the thigh,

224
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.640
than to have it explained to you
that you have depression.

225
00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.320
Your brain is broken
and you don't see it. - Exactly.

226
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:47.160
One is afraid
to tell people that,

227
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.840
because you have to talk about it forever.

228
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.120
It is
in the nature of depression,

229
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.480
that you can hardly convey
what it is like.

230
00:12:56.040 --> 00:13:00.560
I always try to repeat myself
to repeat myself in my topics.

231
00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.040
But I never get tired
to talk about it,

232
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.400
because it is the only talking
that is good for anything.

233
00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.560
That you did that ...

234
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:12.240
I'm doing it here now.
This is fantastic.

235
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.320
That was then also the subject ...

236
00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.400
Last fall I was in the
eight weeks in the clinic.

237
00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:21.440
I have also
not noticed for three years.

238
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:25.600
For three years
from doctor to doctor and thought,

239
00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:29.720
I have such a vague feeling,
like being in love,

240
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.920
but with crazy butterflies,
with evil ones.

241
00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:34.680
Yes, evil butterflies.

242
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:38.040
A sinking feeling where you think:
I'm about to puke.

243
00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.640
I spent three years
to doctors.

244
00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.040
At some point I thought:
Maybe you are a hypochondriac,

245
00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.720
have a tumor,
a blood clot.

246
00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:48.880
I am through all these tubes

247
00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:52.960
And every doctor said:
"We can't find anything."

248
00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:56.440
Until last year
someone approached me and said:

249
00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:59.800
"Maybe you're depressed."
I thought about it.

250
00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:07.040
The peak was last fall,
when I was supposed to go shopping.

251
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.000
I got up in the morning and thought:

252
00:14:09.160 --> 00:14:11.520
Tonight you have to
cook for the children.

253
00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.320
Try making a shopping list.

254
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.240
That took four hours, I
walked around in my kitchen,

255
00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:21.240
to know: What do you have there,
what else do you need?

256
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.080
Then there were
five things on that list.

257
00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.160
I was in the supermarket,
started crying,

258
00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.560
because I thought:
I don't know how to do that anymore.

259
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.600
Then I left the supermarket
leaving, crying and thinking,

260
00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.040
i am ashamed,
because I have to tell my children

261
00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.960
"I don't know anymore,
how to shop."

262
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.160
There's a disk between us.
Never mind, put it on.

263
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.880
Like this.
Yes, that's exactly how it is.

264
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.200
That describes it best,
I think.

265
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.760
This complete overcharge
with absolute pill pellets

266
00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.000
and this feeling,
that you can not describe.

267
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:03.680
This foreign feeling of ...
It's just terrible.

268
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:07.040
Did you spend eight weeks
in a clinic? - Yes.

269
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:10.680
Is that one thing that helps? Yes.
Yes, definitely.

270
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.520
I was mega scared of it.

271
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.120
Do you know what I was
I was most afraid of?

272
00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:19.360
Because I think that for our
profession ... We have a full tit.

273
00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.440
Yes. - I was afraid of it,

274
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.200
when there are psychologists,
therapists,

275
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:28.440
that I am healed, but that
my full tit is also gone.

276
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.120
M-m. - You know?
Yes. - I panicked.

277
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.880
The first thing I said was:

278
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:36.880
Do what you want with me,
I'm in on all the shit.

279
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.520
But I need that full tit.
You have the full tit. - Thank you.

280
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.680
One of the most beautiful compliments.

281
00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.560
But I think, Torsten,
you have a very nice ...

282
00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:52.640
We have a clip
from the Satire Summit where you explain,

283
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:55.560
what for you
depression means. - Okay.

284
00:15:55.880 --> 00:15:58.440
Good day.
I have depression.

285
00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.320
Being shit on
is like a crime scene with the Muppets:

286
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.960
not the best of the best,
but it will pass.

287
00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:11.320
Depression, on the other hand, is like
all three parts "Lord of the Rings",

288
00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.880
in slow motion.
* Audience laughs. *

289
00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.640
With Jean-Claude van Dame
as Gandalf ... * Laughter *

290
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.040
... and music by Andrea Berg.
* Laughter *

291
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.280
(laughs) Yeah.
Shall I tell you something?

292
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.800
I have the same pants on
as now, really uncomfortable.

293
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.520
I need to buy a new pair of jeans.
Depressing.

294
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:33.520
But I find it
cool summary.

295
00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.560
If you don't know depression,
you think, "Haha, very funny."

296
00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:43.280
When you have depression, you have to
laugh, too: "Shit, it's funny."

297
00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.560
We have to.
The depression fucked.

298
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:49.720
I always say: I have
chased the sow out of the house.

299
00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.120
The sow is gone. - Yes ...
Now lives with the mother again.

300
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:58.200
(laughs) She may come back,
but you're armed now.

301
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.320
How was that for you?
So since when ...

302
00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.560
At some point I stopped
wondering.

303
00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:09.440
The peak for me
was last year,

304
00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.040
has taken a run-up
of three years.

305
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.040
I came further and further
into the past and thought:

306
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:19.400
Shit,
you've been depressed for 30 years,

307
00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.920
but still had
this viability still.

308
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.840
The black cloud came
and was gone again,

309
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.840
but I was viable.
Yes.

310
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.840
I am also a man
and we men then always say:

311
00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.080
Well, there are worse things.

312
00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:39.240
Or: My neighbor has only one leg.
It's in the nature of things, yes.

313
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:43.040
Until one then kills oneself, which often
which often does not go well in the immediate environment.

314
00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:46.640
Did you have suicidal thoughts?
I had suicidal thoughts.

315
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.280
That's one thing,
you never forget.

316
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.520
The most blatant suicidal thoughts
are with me ... What do we have?

317
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.720
... already 25 years ago,
which sounds a lot.

318
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.920
But think about it,
you are 54.

319
00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.200
That was when I had the worst phase.

320
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.760
A suicidal thought is a
Thought about killing yourself,

321
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.720
that suddenly seems plausible to you
you know? - Yeah, sure.

322
00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.760
Do you think I'm up for..,
to throw myself in front of a train?

323
00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.960
Or ... One does not know at all.

324
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.280
Killing yourself
is always terrible.

325
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:20.720
But it seemed so plausible,
that you thought:

326
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.000
"Alternatively, I could
kill myself now.

327
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.960
Then I would have
no more problems at all."

328
00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.560
Just this thing, this valley ...

329
00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:34.120
You have to catch people beforehand and
and do something about it.

330
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:38.240
I didn't kill myself
because I was scared.

331
00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:41.200
But the thought
I found extremely tempting.

332
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.640
I was scared.
How can someone kill himself?

333
00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.440
Starvation is
is out of the question. - Yes.

334
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.040
Then I went
went to a doctor.

335
00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:54.760
I didn't recognize my depression,
thought: It all really sucks.

336
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.240
I didn't even use the word.

337
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.440
Then I had
terrible thoughts of suicide.

338
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.560
It was never that bad again.

339
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.200
Creeping thoughts,
where you think

340
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:08.280
These are not mine,
but they are compatible enough,

341
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.400
to make this palatable to me.

342
00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:16.960
That's why clinics are important, because
if you can go to a clinic,

343
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.080
Whether a day hospital or inpatient:
This is not as in

344
00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.200
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."

345
00:19:22.360 --> 00:19:26.000
Yes, the day clinic
looked like an apartment,

346
00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:29.920
an oversized, large
old apartment. - Yes, of course.

347
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:34.160
I also had such thoughts,
thought: psychiatry, hospital ...

348
00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.360
You don't have to be a depressive
lie in bed for 15 hours,

349
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.000
in a clinic.

350
00:19:39.160 --> 00:19:42.320
You are not a depressive for me,
you have depression.

351
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.800
You are Kurt Krömer.

352
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.880
You are also Kurt Krömer.

353
00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.640
But you have depression.

354
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.960
You did not become a depressive
like a Power Ranger.

355
00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:57.640
Did you sometimes feel ...
Let's get to the appearance.

356
00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.840
We are...
You see yourself, don't you?

357
00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.800
Two comedians meet,
both depressed.

358
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.840
The cliché of ourselves.
Yes, of course.

359
00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:10.440
One day before the clinic
I still performed.

360
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:14.120
Four performances in the Wuhlheide,
the best time of my life.

361
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.360
Always these two hours
on the stage.

362
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:21.880
Before was shit, after was
sucked, but the gig was awesome.

363
00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.960
Before didn't suck as much as
after, but it also sucked. - Yes.

364
00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.680
It got better with adrenaline,
the clapping, the euphoria.

365
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.840
I sometimes had the feeling ...

366
00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.160
Does depression make us funny?
It's a bit like alcohol.

367
00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:43.040
Am I only funny when I drink
I drink schnapps before the performance?

368
00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:46.280
Can I leave that out
and be funny by myself?

369
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.040
Or has that
the depression made of me?

370
00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.680
On stage, depression gives
gives the monkey sugar.

371
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.240
I have myself ...

372
00:20:55.400 --> 00:21:00.280
When I realized I was telling you something,
you thought it was funny and laughed,

373
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.800
let's multiply that
with 500,000 people ...

374
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.480
I had phases,
where I played for 3.5 hours

375
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:11.400
on the neck of the audience,
who was also tired ...

376
00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.960
Have a few begged yet?
"When can we ..."

377
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.400
You can see it in the posture.
3.5 hours is already ...

378
00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.520
I didn't want to call it a day.
Yeah, right.

379
00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:25.400
One evening in Bielefeld
I knew

380
00:21:25.720 --> 00:21:29.800
I have about 40 minutes ago
passed any zenith.

381
00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.560
But I still have
something really funny,

382
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.800
with this I could save it
and pull it to 40 minutes.

383
00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.080
I was thinking,
as long as we're all together...

384
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.520
This is my function,
I function excellently.

385
00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.400
I had a good time,

386
00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:48.720
but it is peculiar,
how a depression immediately ...

387
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.400
Like a dark jacket,
as soon as you come off the stage.

388
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.120
An old fat witch,
who sits on the chest

389
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.320
and immobilizes you.

390
00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:03.000
A shit smelling
old witch. - Yes! And you are...

391
00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:07.920
In the end I was busy for 15 hours with
with some kind of problem.

392
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:11.440
The nasty thing is:
You don't get a solution. - Yes.

393
00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.840
When you're in a normal mood,
you say:

394
00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.120
"I'll solve that tomorrow,
now I'm having a good time."

395
00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:20.120
Depression means,
you have this problem 15 hours,

396
00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.440
you don't find a solution and the next day
the next day it starts all over again.

397
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.840
Because these are often not problems.

398
00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.640
The famous picture I hate:
the carousel of thoughts.

399
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:35.520
It's like the head cinema,
Cliché terms.

400
00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:38.640
But the thought carousel fits,

401
00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.040
only that it is
is operated by a psychopath,

402
00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.960
runs too fast
and every wanker jumps up. - Yes.

403
00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:47.760
Mostly they were
no real problems,

404
00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:52.120
it was only facts,
where we thought: They are too much for us.

405
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.760
Until four in the morning.

406
00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.800
I once had
a small bottle deposit problem.

407
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.440
You can also get

408
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.680
Superman's Fortress of Solitude
build from empties.

409
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.640
All these things I had.

410
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:07.120
I was sitting in a shack without electricity.

411
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.640
I would have had the money,
but I had missed the time,

412
00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.640
where someone comes along
and unscrews fuses.

413
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.520
At that time
screws and a seal in front of it.

414
00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:22.400
I didn't get the hang of it,
with the remittance slip

415
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.560
to go downtown
and talk to someone,

416
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:28.760
whom I do not know
and give him 180 marks.

417
00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.480
Did you also have panic attacks?
Yes.

418
00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.280
I had a panic attack
in the movie "Wolf

419
00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.320
with Jack Nicholson
and Michelle Pfeiffer.

420
00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:40.520
This is a perfect lullifilm.

421
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.240
I had a panic attack
and did not finish watching it.

422
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.600
And I had one
in "Forrest Gump".

423
00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.600
I didn't want to miss the chance
to go to the cinema.

424
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:51.240
And that sucked too.

425
00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.960
It became dark
and I already thought ...

426
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.000
So, you know? - Yes.
Uncontrolled trembling.

427
00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.080
The symptoms
are difficulty sleeping,

428
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.160
Difficulty concentrating.

429
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:05.800
I was also forgetful

430
00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.400
and had to put down notes like a dementia patient.
I had to put down notes like a dementia patient.

431
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:13.920
From the colorful spectrum you can
choose from, there is everything possible.

432
00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:17.440
Such a golden cauldron
full of shit,

433
00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.360
that is poured over your head
and where they say: Now get out.

434
00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:24.440
Yes, but there is help.
They always say that, don't they?

435
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.880
I do not like such terms
like "self-help groups".

436
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.720
That would be another question.
But: helps. - I was afraid

437
00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:38.920
that through the clinic
I am becoming such a positive person,

438
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:42.080
who only reads books like
"Don't worry, live!",

439
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:45.640
who lectures everyone and says "I
think you have depression",

440
00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.480
who puts himself only on the positive side
of life and says:

441
00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.920
I don't want to hear about the bad things
from the bad things.

442
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.720
That was a fallacy.
That is a fallacy.

443
00:24:55.880 --> 00:25:00.080
You are done,
you're mostly done.

444
00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.600
I set a goal for myself today:
If there are people out there,

445
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:07.480
who say "Shit, the symptoms,
that Krömer mentioned,

446
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:09.520
I have too" ...

447
00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.800
Where do you go?
Where do you go?

448
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:17.760
You go to your family doctor.
It's all difficult these days.

449
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.360
You go to your primary care doctor first.

450
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.000
Let's first address
the word to all people,

451
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.320
who have relatives
have with depression.

452
00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.720
You can't do much now.
Driving service would be a good thing.

453
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:33.840
Or help with daily
Help with daily tasks

454
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.760
and make a little phone call.

455
00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:39.200
That is simply difficult for us,
is often insurmountable.

456
00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.800
Family doctor: always a good thing.
I am a friend of family doctors.

457
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:48.760
At some point, the man knows you,
unlike the caravan ...

458
00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:52.200
Your family doctor knows you,
or your family doctor, of course.

459
00:25:52.920 --> 00:25:56.480
He will look
where a psychiatrist is.

460
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.360
And then you have to
go the steps.

461
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:02.080
And sometimes,
when you're in a really bad way:

462
00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.120
Then go to the hospital in the evening,
most of them have a department.

463
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.280
It sounds stupid,
like "the closed one".

464
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.040
But that's just so that no one
comes in and steals the furniture.

465
00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:16.080
You can also
go to any normal emergency room,

466
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.640
when you think
you can't go any further.

467
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:23.240
No shame because you are sick.
You have zero shame.

468
00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:28.640
Sometimes you also think
you just suck. - Yes.

469
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:32.640
Everything works for the others,
but you're stupid. - Exactly.

470
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.400
My favorite saying was always:
"You always with your shitty mood."

471
00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.400
* (LAUGHING)
And then I ...

472
00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.960
With a person from the family.

473
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.560
I started to cry
and said:

474
00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.360
"If this was a bad mood,
I'd be happy."

475
00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:53.520
A bad mood
you can push aside.

476
00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:55.520
But this condition remains.

477
00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.440
You can tell me
"You won 6 million in the lottery".

478
00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.120
and I would say
"I'm not picking this up now,

479
00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:03.880
it is too heavy for me,
I don't have a bag for it,

480
00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.240
i have to pay tax on this
and everything sucks.

481
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:09.920
The people
are overwhelmed by tears.

482
00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:12.400
It must already be concrete
Granny run in,

483
00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.560
so that tears are accepted.

484
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:18.440
I cry more often, I must say,
when something overwhelms me.

485
00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.440
I try to do this
in a closed room.

486
00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:26.760
I also cry sometimes because I'm
simply feel good and things are going well.

487
00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.120
I had tears in my eyes,
when you started to talk.

488
00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.440
Because we are more again,
already two. - Yes.

489
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.880
There can't be much more
also not much more to come.

490
00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:40.000
No, we have
also already overdrawn.

491
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.200
Come on, let's go out
and call it a day. - Okay.

492
00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.600
Too bad, I would have liked
talked some more.

493
00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:53.160
Now we say goodbye
actually to the audience.

494
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:56.640
(laughs) Okay, I'm coming over.
Did you miss the laughs?

495
00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.720
(laughs) Nice.
No, I didn't miss anything,

496
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.680
because I got much more
than I thought.

497
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:07.360
An employee from rbb asked me
whether we should record laughs.

498
00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.640
Are you a friend of this?
The guy has a fractured cheekbone.

499
00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.320
I have beaten
I beat him to the point of hospitalization.

500
00:28:13.480 --> 00:28:14.960
I guess that means no.

501
00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.400
Are we saying goodbye now?
We are saying goodbye now.

502
00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.360
Uh...

503
00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.680
Yes, do it ...
It's sad, isn't it?

504
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.000
No, none of this is sad.

505
00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:28.960
This is a moment when I know
I'm not depressed.

506
00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:31.480
The condition is sad,
but I know...

507
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:37.160
I overcame my depression
in this shit corona time.

508
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.920
It's schizophrenic.

509
00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.440
You go out on the street
and say "I am healed

510
00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.160
and you're not allowed to hug anyone.

511
00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.080
All pull a face,
because they are depressed

512
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.400
and I'm running around thinking:
"Yo, guys, rejoice!"

513
00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.400
I don't know what kind of
guilt complex you're developing right now,

514
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:58.960
but you have done a great service
great service, for example, to me

515
00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.840
You too. I used you a little bit
exploited you, because I knew

516
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.840
you are depressed,
I can have a conversation with you.

517
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.520
Talking to someone
who wasn't depressed is ...

518
00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.800
Difficult. - Difficult.
Seems strange.

519
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.920
But I do not feel exploited here
here. - Okay, then come on.

520
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.720
Take care, neighbors.
Thank you, Torsten Sträter.

521
00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:24.520
Thank you, Kurt Krömer.

522
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:27.880
Didn't you like it?
Why is no one clapping?

523
00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.680
* Music *

524
00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.400
# You are the one for me, for me

525
00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.000
# For me, formidable

526
00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.520
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable
