00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.080
.

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.040
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.400
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.000
# You are my love
very, very, veritable

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.920
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.360
Boris Palmer, 48 years old,

7
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.400
since 2007
Lord Mayor of T체bingen.

8
00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.280
He said about Berlin: "When I
arrive there, I always think:

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.640
Caution, you are leaving the
functioning part of Germany.

10
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.400
Mr. Palmer?

11
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.800
Yes?

12
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.320
You thought that
nothing works in Berlin?

13
00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.160
You have never been to rbb.

14
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.880
I'm happy to be taught.

15
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.560
Please? I had
a whistle on the line.

16
00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.520
I'm happy to be taught,

17
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.040
but you said
it's different at rbb.

18
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.080
They did not understand that.

19
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.680
That's what we'll cut
out first today.

20
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.880
Here we go.

21
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.600
* Door buzzer *

22
00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.640
* Door buzzer still sounds *

23
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600
* Door buzzer still sounds *

24
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.320
* Door buzzer still sounds *

25
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.080
* Door buzzer silenced *

26
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.880
So, here I am.
Pleased to meet you.

27
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.000
Since when has there been a lamp hanging here?

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.280
Have you sprayed yourself?
No.

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.400
Deal, please.
Are you putting your hands through?

30
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.200
Is that what they do in Berlin?
Yes, yes do that something ...

31
00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.000
* coughs *

32
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.360
That was the other one.

33
00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.640
Mr. Palmer, you are ...

34
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.680
Wait,
I've written it all down.

35
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.520
Mr. Palmer,
the Greens would like to see you in 2022

36
00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.760
after a total of 15 years
as Lord Mayor of T체bingen

37
00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.400
no longer set up.

38
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.880
Do not compete anymore

39
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.040
or are you going on a kind of
farewell tour today?

40
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.880
Two years to go,
I'll have to think about that,

41
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.040
are then 16 years, a long time.

42
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.320
You have to decide
whether to compete again.

43
00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.880
There are still 2 years until 2022.
I think so.

44
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.080
A bit rounded up, eh?

45
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.680
Are you into pain
or why are you here today?

46
00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.240
They begged for so long,
that I come

47
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.480
- I could no longer say no.
We asked 1 time.

48
00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.680
I canceled 17 times.
That's how it is with politicians,

49
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.480
there is a camera somewhere
or so, b채hm - immediately there.

50
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.520
My secretary said:
"He won't let up."

51
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.000
When I say the word
say the word "refugees,

52
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.200
soap me then
for half an hour?

53
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.560
No, as a politician
you should answer questions

54
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.680
and not annoy the moderator.

55
00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.280
Was that a tip? - Nope.

56
00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:23.920
Honest view.

57
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.160
Are you a bit annoyed?
Not at all.

58
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.240
Did you have a good journey?
Amazingly, yes.

59
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.440
The planes are half empty and
arrive much earlier than normal.

60
00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.720
Do you fly green, yes?
Not really.

61
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.920
Or did you fly by train?
Unfortunately not.

62
00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.800
But as a full-time
Lord Mayor

63
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.480
I had a session the next morning
a meeting.

64
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.280
So, for all,
who do not know you, so all,

65
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.800
we show why your party
doesn't want you anymore.

66
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.360
I'll tell you brutally:

67
00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.440
We save in Germany
maybe people,

68
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.480
who would be dead in half a year

69
00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.520
due to their age
and their pre-existing conditions.

70
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.560
You have driven the Porsche
against the wall, didn't you?

71
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.640
But before that, we honked loudly again.

72
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.480
I don't drive a car,
so I can't have any say in the matter,

73
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.880
but as a mathematician I am in favor
that facts should be analyzed soberly.

74
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.520
It is a fact that
the life expectancy of people,

75
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.080
who died with Corona was only a few
has been only a few years.

76
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.560
I could list,

77
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.960
how and by whom you were
you were beaten up for the statement,

78
00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.760
but that's not my style.

79
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.560
I ask directly, what is behind
behind this stupid fucking statement?

80
00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.080
Reality,
that with the lockdown

81
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.000
probably as many lives
risk and lose,

82
00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.080
how we try to save.

83
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.680
To say that openly,
is difficult,

84
00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.320
because conflicting goals
are associated with it.

85
00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.760
Among others between the rich 1st world,
which protects itself

86
00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.080
and the poor 3rd world,
who then leave their children in poverty

87
00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.040
and for lack of health care
die with hunger.

88
00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.040
That's the way our world is - not pretty.

89
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.200
What are we going to do with the old people?
Lock them away?

90
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.200
No, we better protect them.

91
00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.440
T체bingen started 4 weeks ago
started, as I suggested at the time,

92
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.280
the nursing staff of all nursing homes
to be tested regularly,

93
00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.240
so that the virus does not reach
to the elderly people at risk.

94
00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.280
A very different statement
than "We lock up old people

95
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:35.040
or let them die,
because they die anyway".

96
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.840
That's right, I never said.

97
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.160
Instead, he said, we need to weigh up how many
lives we protect through lockdowns,

98
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.360
how many do they cost on the other hand.

99
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.560
To look at only one
and ignore the other,

100
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.080
is not human,
but ignorant.

101
00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.160
Why are you putting out something like that,
that you might think,

102
00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.760
Palmer says we can
we can let the old people die.

103
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.400
One can only think.

104
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.040
There would not have been
such a media boom,

105
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.160
you would have worded it differently,

106
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:06.320
e.g. on breakfast television on
Sat.1, as you are now telling me.

107
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.240
Then you would have perished.

108
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.080
No, I said
I said on breakfast television.

109
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.280
That was 7 minutes and
You cut out 15 seconds

110
00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.400
and pull out the sentence that is
best misinterpreted, out.

111
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:20.560
It's being dragged through the cocoa.

112
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.760
This is our
hysterical excitement democracy.

113
00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.760
Would you listen to the 7 minutes,

114
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.480
one would never have
this false interpretation.

115
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.680
Wasn't that sentence crap, too?
It was unwise.

116
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.640
The beautiful Habeck calls
the sentence as false and heartless.

117
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.160
Nobody likes you in the Greens.
Are you the black sheep?

118
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:43.960
I don't think you have to be
have to be liked in politics.

119
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.240
But only a few people
with the Greens

120
00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.720
you like
still rudimentary, don't you?

121
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:54.680
An initiative of almost 100 Greens,
predominantly the founding generation,

122
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:58.160
strongly advocated
that I remain in the party

123
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.160
and it is important to deal with
to deal with my statements.

124
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:06.000
We were founded as a party of dispute
and pluralism.

125
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.640
At our party congresses
at party congresses.

126
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.920
Why should that be
be different with me?

127
00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.320
Palmer and the Greens,
that doesn't go together.

128
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.160
When will you get the message?

129
00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.520
I will never understand that, because
I am an ecologist by conviction.

130
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.200
For ecologists
there is no other party.

131
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.880
The others do not take
the issue seriously.

132
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.680
Are you the only one in the Green Party
who sees this correctly? - No.

133
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.600
Do we perhaps have to
kick out all the greens?

134
00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.480
Then only you are still there
and let the new greens in,

135
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:41.560
that work the way you do?

136
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.160
They then sit at the barrier:
"My opinion: in".

137
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.440
That's what others are trying to do.

138
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.960
I think my opinion
has a place with the Greens.

139
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.320
Nothing comes from you or
do you want to leave here today?

140
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.000
Would also be a blast.
I see no reason to leave.

141
00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:03.480
I want us to protect the climate
do, protect the environment,

142
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:07.240
protect ourselves from
from destroying civilization.

143
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.640
This requires a party
that drives the issue forward.

144
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.960
That's what the Greens are doing,
that's why I'm in. - Forever?

145
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:18.000
As long as they do that
they don't do that anymore, I'll resign.

146
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.920
You are completely satisfied?!

147
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.800
You are the rabble-rouser
who is with the Greens

148
00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.960
and do not like the others.

149
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.240
But it doesn't matter,
the others are to blame.

150
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:32.960
I have no problem with the fact
that others do not like me.

151
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.560
It's not about being liked,
being liked,

152
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.880
but I stand for example for the fact that
the economy grows in T체bingen

153
00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.720
and the CO2 emission footprint
shrinks.

154
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:46.280
That is green politics,
anyone can deal with it

155
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.160
and evaluate it as he wants.

156
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.960
In August 2015, Merkel said
on the refugee crisis:

157
00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:53.640
"We can do it."

158
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.320
What does Boris say?

159
00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.160
Please do not tell,
of course: "We can't do it".

160
00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:00.880
Correct.

161
00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.040
You can't say:
"Merkel said it great,

162
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.800
i agree with her once."

163
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.480
You must be against it.

164
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.800
Is this your scam,
to see what the others say

165
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.680
and then to be against it? - No,
but I disagree,

166
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.240
I see no reason
not to say it.

167
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.840
In September 2015
you blurted out in an interview,

168
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.720
Currently, more than 70% of
of the refugees are young men.

169
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.400
Depending on,
how you define young man,

170
00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.000
but only 38-50 % of
young men.

171
00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:38.480
Was that a Monday when you
gave the interview?

172
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.480
Nah, that was September.

173
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.160
As everyone knows, this was
the beginning of the large access numbers

174
00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.800
and 3 or 4 months later
the data was

175
00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.200
the way you say them,
published.

176
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.440
My impression was not
far from reality.

177
00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.880
Predominantly
young men came at that time,

178
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.400
at least that was the case
in our city.

179
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.000
As a mathematician, you must
you must be familiar with numbers.

180
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.440
Yes, this estimate was
not wrong in the basic statement.

181
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.080
One does not estimate
in mathematics. - Yes, you do.

182
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.880
You can even use maximum
Likelihood estimation.

183
00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.120
Often in mathematics one does not know
not exactly what there is,

184
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:15.760
then is estimated.

185
00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.800
You wrote a book
about the refugee crisis:

186
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.920
"We can't help everyone".

187
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.400
Correct.
What was the content?

188
00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.120
Have you read it?
I have had it read,

189
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:31.560
but the man is ill,
who made this.

190
00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:35.960
Can you summarize,
what this book was about?

191
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.080
Unfortunately, it is a bad habit
to judge books,

192
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.120
if you know the title
and do not read the content.

193
00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:44.920
But I'm happy to explain.
The book tries to ...

194
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.160
"We can't ..." how, what?
"... help everyone."

195
00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:51.160
It tries,
to show step by step ...

196
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.600
You know, not want,
also means, well, doesn't matter.

197
00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:57.720
... where the limits
of the feasible lie.

198
00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:00.280
From a municipal-political
perspective:

199
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:03.520
how many apartments
and kindergartens can be built,

200
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.360
how many people can be integrated
and language courses can be given.

201
00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.360
That has objective limits,
They have to be named.

202
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.520
These were significantly
below 10,000 new entries per day.

203
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.760
That was the time when Merkel said:
"We can do it".

204
00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.280
We only made it
because they made this pact

205
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.920
made with Erdogan
and the borders are closed.

206
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.600
Who is everyone in that case?

207
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.920
All 7.8 billion people,
who want to come to T체bingen

208
00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.800
and you say: "That's not possible,
we can't help everyone"?

209
00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.480
Nah, there are currently about
60 million refugees in the world,

210
00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.000
of which we have
1 million were raised.

211
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.720
Are they all coming to T체bingen?
No, but ...

212
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:44.640
That would be a crowd in T체bingen,
if they all had a taste for ice cream

213
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.120
and then all
standing in front of the ice cream parlor.

214
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.000
That gives a mixture.
No, that's 1400.

215
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.240
Everyone orders a bullet,
not always the same.

216
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.960
Some may have
a lactose intolerance.

217
00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.200
That drags on. And when he asks,
you want sprinkles on it,

218
00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:04.160
there are several variants.

219
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.320
With masks ... This is scary.

220
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.560
... and with 1.50 m distance.
No, ice is not scary.

221
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.200
But we can
the problem of refugees

222
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.040
not by admission
solve the problem in Germany,

223
00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.360
but only there,
where people live.

224
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.600
That is, if one is honest,
the only real solution.

225
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:24.640
In 2017, you wanted to be informed of all
black asylum seekers in T체bingen

226
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.320
Take DNA samples.

227
00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:31.920
Do you still want to say
what happened back then? - Say that, yes.

228
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:36.560
There were 4 rapes
in public

229
00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:40.800
and all were
committed by a black man.

230
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.640
This was reported by the victims.

231
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.120
There are in T체bingen at this age,
who said: "young man around 20",

232
00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.840
hardly any young, black men,
who are not asylum seekers.

233
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.960
This is in the nature of things.

234
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.600
Do so many ask for asylum
and one has 4 concrete cases,

235
00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.720
I find
a screening is appropriate.

236
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.960
It was ordered by the court.

237
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.200
Let's take a look at Deutsche Bahn.

238
00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.040
In April 2019 you stirred

239
00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.960
about an advertising campaign
by Deutsche Bahn.

240
00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.320
The question was, which
society should this represent?

241
00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:17.000
What was the problem?

242
00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.840
I ask you: Why
should it be right the other way around?

243
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.040
when suddenly in the advertising
no more people appear,

244
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.880
who are white German men
or women are?

245
00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:31.000
Why should advertising
only people of color

246
00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:34.240
and people with
migrant background emerge.

247
00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.200
There is a white man
and a woman, everything is tutti.

248
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.280
The picture represents,
as it exists.

249
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.200
The first 5 people
are all people of color.

250
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.640
Below left I notice
positive about the campaign,

251
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.920
that there are now at the Deutsche Bahn
D체r체m kebab is now available

252
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.160
and no more K철nigsberger Klopse.

253
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.640
But you see,
5 people are people of color.

254
00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.640
The last one, I didn't know,
that he is, world champion,

255
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.680
but with a migrant background:
Finnish citizen.

256
00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:07.880
Has he now
the right to be world champion

257
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:12.880
to be there as a black man
or if he were not world champion,

258
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.200
that he is not in there.
He has the right.

259
00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:19.840
I have the right to ask ...
Is he also a rapist?

260
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.440
No, I have the right to ask,
what is the intention?

261
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.160
I think it is wrong that
suddenly the majority of people,

262
00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:30.600
75 % in Germany
have no migration background,

263
00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.600
in such an advertisement
no longer appears at all.

264
00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:36.000
I maintain,
there is intention behind it.

265
00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:40.240
By reversing the discrimination
is to reverse the other discrimination

266
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.640
to be undone,
to purify themselves in this way:

267
00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:46.600
We are innocent.
I think that is wrong.

268
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.880
Do you think now that
Deutsche Bahn always calls you,

269
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:55.040
when a new campaign is coming up and
she asks if everything is legal?

270
00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:59.000
No, but why am I not allowed
not question and discuss,

271
00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.760
how Deutsche Bahn
does its advertising?

272
00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.680
I have criticism of it.

273
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.920
They wrote a letter
to Ronald Pofalla.

274
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.360
Has there been any feedback?
No, not that I know of.

275
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.320
Then the breakdown was
was completely for the ass.

276
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.320
No, I think amazing,

277
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.440
that Deutsche Bahn
does not answer and explain,

278
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:21.120
what she wanted with it.

279
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.920
It all sounds
a bit bitter, I think.

280
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:28.960
Well. - Why are you angry?
At whom? - I am not angry.

281
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.800
How to design the interrogation,

282
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.320
do not expect
no joyful answers.

283
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.520
But you were already sitting here
when I came in.

284
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:38.720
I was asked to sit in.

285
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.400
You do that,
even though you don't feel like it?

286
00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.720
What is the reason?
Let's drop the covers for a moment.

287
00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.840
I get out of the figure
and ask you, why do you come here?

288
00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.440
This is not a record
that you put on the market

289
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.080
or a new book.
Because I face.

290
00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.560
I do not evade
when someone wants to talk to me.

291
00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:01.320
So go everywhere.

292
00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.840
If I were a gardener in Neuk철lln,
you would come too,

293
00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.040
because there are 20 people sitting there,
listening to you, or what?

294
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.280
Probably not due to time constraints.

295
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.800
But I have no reason
to chicken out of your questions.

296
00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.000
Did we invite you like this? - No.

297
00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:18.920
Don't chicken out
from my questions, come on.

298
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:22.120
If I hadn't come,
you would have said that, wouldn't you?

299
00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.920
Then I would have
taken another cardboard nose.

300
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:28.040
Only those that do not pinch.

301
00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.880
Why go anywhere?
I have nothing to hide.

302
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.080
I'm an artificial character, aren't I?

303
00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:37.280
You are also
a kind of art figure, actually.

304
00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:40.600
You play the character Boris Palmer.
That's what you believe.

305
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:43.680
You're not as private
as you pretend to be, are you?

306
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.560
That's a scam, isn't it? - Nope.
To get attention.

307
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:52.160
This belongs to the insinuations,
that someone with a conviction ...

308
00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:54.840
But these are always things,
where everyone says:

309
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.120
"This is what we see together here,
this is all beautiful."

310
00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:02.040
Then the Palmer from the bush:
"I disagree."

311
00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.880
Great, if you do not
go with the flow.

312
00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:08.160
I am also like that,
when everyone thinks someone is great,

313
00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.600
I think about it for a moment,
whether I also see that.

314
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:13.360
These are things,
where a hegemony is trying,

315
00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:16.600
a pseudo-harmony
and create a consensus,

316
00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.800
that is not there in the population.

317
00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.240
I believe
this is detrimental to democracy.

318
00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.280
If I have a different opinion,
I will bring them in and argue with them.

319
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.520
This has nothing
to do with a role.

320
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:31.000
That is the insinuation,
it is not meant seriously,

321
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.720
then it is done.

322
00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.840
No, what I am saying is what I mean.

323
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.720
I find this advertising wrong,
divisive.

324
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:41.600
It bothers me because it
transports a wrong message

325
00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.160
and reproduces the error that groups are not
represented, is reproduced.

326
00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.760
That's what I say,
that's what I want to argue about.

327
00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.840
Why is this a problem for you?

328
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.320
That's not a problem,
I'm just wondering,

329
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.520
why do you always open your mouth
when you know it's going to go bang afterwards.

330
00:17:57.680 --> 00:18:00.560
For me, it's like this,
that you say and think things:

331
00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.360
"The main thing
is spelled correctly

332
00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:06.800
and a picture of me with it.
That's how some journalists think.

333
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.600
I always open my mouth.

334
00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.320
If it does not suit you,
perceive it.

335
00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.320
Do you like it
or does not bother you, then do not.

336
00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:17.960
You make provocative statements,
so that you are heard.

337
00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.400
No, because closing your mouth
is not good in democracy.

338
00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:24.800
People who say nothing and
let everything happen to them,

339
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:27.800
made the GDR possible.
That is still not far away.

340
00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.680
Are you afraid of the GDR?

341
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.080
No, but from the fact that
not saying anything in democracy.

342
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.200
I am a friend
that you open your mouth.

343
00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:39.640
Why does it bother you with me?
What I say does not suit you.

344
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:43.480
You talk such shit sometimes.
That's calculated.

345
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:46.760
If you open your mouth,
You do the math.

346
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:50.640
You know that it bangs
and at what volume. - No.

347
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.760
Opening your mouth is a problem,
when you say something,

348
00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.280
what the other does not want to hear.
Just then you have to do it.

349
00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:01.600
You said in an interview,

350
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:04.840
since the attacks
on New Year's Eve in Cologne

351
00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.440
even
green professors come to me,

352
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:11.160
who say: "I have
two blonde daughters and worry,

353
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.480
when now 60 Arab men
live 200 meters away."

354
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.720
It was like that.
Somehow that sounded familiar.

355
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.160
The fear spaces
are getting bigger in our country.

356
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:29.320
Especially for blonde women
they unfortunately become larger and larger

357
00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.880
and that in our own country,
dear friends.

358
00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.560
This is unbearable.

359
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.560
Did you coordinate beforehand?

360
00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:41.960
This is the first time I've heard this. Was
before or after my testimony?

361
00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:43.840
That was, I think, before that.

362
00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.960
I'd be happy to take a look at it.
I'm hearing this for the first time.

363
00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:52.920
No, that was what the professor
told me in my office.

364
00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:56.760
That you do not grow a nose now,
but it's a big miracle.

365
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.960
You had that day off or what?

366
00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:04.680
You are welcome to insinuate
that I'm lying - that's just the way it was.

367
00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.240
Not that you are lying,
only you are crazy.

368
00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:11.000
This is the continuation
of discrediting

369
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.440
of other views,
that they must then be cranks.

370
00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.440
How can it be that a nutcase
twice with a clear majority

371
00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:21.640
in a city
with 90,000 inhabitants was elected?

372
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.240
One could
deal with it seriously.

373
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.120
But back to H철cke again.

374
00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.720
Can you or will you
not pay attention there,

375
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:32.400
what rhetoric you are using
you are using? - No, I don't.

376
00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.040
Says the AfD in the morning,
the day has 24 hours,

377
00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.440
I do not say,
no, that's only 23.

378
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.480
Well, the AfD is of the opinion,
the earth is a disk.

379
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.960
She would say,
the earth is a sphere,

380
00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.280
I would have to say,
no, disc? - Nope.

381
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:50.120
I am not interested in what the AfD
stands on an issue,

382
00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:52.880
but, how is
the facts really are.

383
00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.120
We had a survey in T체bingen,

384
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.080
How did the
people's sense of security?

385
00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:03.800
The sense of security suffered
massively after the large influx of immigrants.

386
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.600
The public spaces
have changed.

387
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:10.320
If such fears are not taken seriously,
populists like the

388
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:13.520
the voices in afterwards.
That's what you have to take care of.

389
00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.440
Is that what you are protecting us from?

390
00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.480
Before that we created
in T체bingen, for example, protection,

391
00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:22.320
by creating 8 positions in the municipal
order service,

392
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:25.360
who controlled the public space at night
controlled,

393
00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.440
to show security and presence
of the state.

394
00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.880
Provoking runs
runs in your family.

395
00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:35.320
Her father was a civil rights activist
and wrote a book in 1978.

396
00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.000
We have that available.

397
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.480
Have it with pleasure
already seen lying.

398
00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.320
"My struggle."
"And Resistance."

399
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.440
"And resistance."

400
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.120
In Filbinger Land.

401
00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.800
That's the Palmer scam, isn't it?

402
00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.880
"Mein Kampf" larger
and so Bild newspaper-like

403
00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:56.520
the small signature in between.

404
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:00.760
You don't look at it and say:
The book is called: "And Resistance".

405
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.200
It is called:
"My Struggle and Resistance,

406
00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.040
I knew it by heart.

407
00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:09.880
Today, one makes in every
Click articles in online media

408
00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:13.080
first a teaser
and only catches it afterwards.

409
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.760
Often
the mere headlines are wrong.

410
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.800
First of all, put down a banger.

411
00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:21.120
This is how clickbaiting works,
every online medium ...

412
00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:24.920
But you knew, there was this book
existed before without resistance?

413
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:27.160
I paid attention in school.

414
00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.880
You were in the office that day, yes?
Yes.

415
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.240
My father was the son
of a Jewish father.

416
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.960
He suffered from it massively in the 3rd Reich
and was punished all his life

417
00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:41.080
insulted by Nazis,
ostracized and defamed.

418
00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:43.960
He had every right
to choose this title.

419
00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:48.400
Her father participated as an individual
participated in almost 300 election campaigns,

420
00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.520
but has never won. - Right.

421
00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.880
Was he disciplined
or simply desperate?

422
00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.680
No, he was driven
by his mission.

423
00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:59.400
He wanted for Swiss democracy,

424
00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.040
for ecology in Germany
achieve something

425
00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.920
and used for this
the right to stand for election.

426
00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:09.800
Her father also came
in conflict with the justice system.

427
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.440
In total he served
423 days in prison. - Yes.

428
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.680
You've got a ways to go, don't you?

429
00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.680
I have so far
only with party exclusion ideas

430
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.960
and their interviews.

431
00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.160
But if you want to know,
that was RAF time.

432
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.880
I visited my father
in Stammheim.

433
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:30.720
He was in the same building
as the terrorists.

434
00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:32.680
The visit was organized like this,

435
00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:35.400
that's why I
looked at this carefully,

436
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:39.200
that on the other side,
an official was sitting next to my father.

437
00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.200
I, 6-7 years old at that time, was
with my mother and brother.

438
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:46.920
The conversation was laying hands
on the bulletproof glass.

439
00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.560
That was the whole visit.

440
00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.640
My father was in jail for insulting
for insulting a public official. That's how it was back then.

441
00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:55.920
We happen to have
have a VTR on hand

442
00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:58.320
from the arrest of her father.

443
00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:04.600
"You break every right, no
possibility of a defender.

444
00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:08.560
Away from coffee because of alleged
Insult through the phone,

445
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.800
that no one can prove.
This is unique in the FRG.

446
00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:15.760
Terror against an individual,
who has no power, is easy.

447
00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:21.320
Please do something for me
if you can.

448
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:25.240
The sentence: 2 months imprisonment
without parole

449
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.200
for the 16th conviction
for insult.

450
00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.840
Why?

451
00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.440
Palmer called the lady from the office
a dirty broad."

452
00:24:36.360 --> 00:24:38.720
How do you grow up
under such a father?

453
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.080
I did not know the movie, thank you.

454
00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.920
Of course you didn't know him,

455
00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.080
that day
you had hiking day at school.

456
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:49.040
Nah, but ...
Why don't you know all this?

457
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.000
I wasn't paying attention, but it was
moving for me to see that.

458
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.840
That's how he reported it.

459
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.520
How do you grow up there?

460
00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.040
With great solidarity,
because a lot of injustice happened to him.

461
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.160
He was a fighter. I was
always on his side as a son.

462
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:10.160
Do you still need emotional time?
No. - Okay.

463
00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.440
You were once considered a potential
successor to Winfried Kretschmann

464
00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:17.400
as Minister President
of Baden-W체rttemberg.

465
00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.360
Come too much after their father
and are at the crucial moment

466
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.240
too bad at keeping your mouth shut?
Can be.

467
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.640
Good.

468
00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:32.600
Then we have everything.

469
00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:37.720
Do you want to
another fat Otto out?

470
00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.600
No, I wanted to
answer your questions.

471
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.320
That was your goal? - Yes.

472
00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.840
What is the next step?
You're what - 48? - Yes.

473
00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:52.080
Have you calculated how
what happens next? - I have a goal.

474
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.400
Leave the Greens,
continue on your own? - No.

475
00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.720
I have
a great political goal.

476
00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.040
In T체bingen I would
like to complete,

477
00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:02.040
as the first city in Germany,

478
00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.080
to become completely free
from fossil energies

479
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.760
and climate protection
become reality.

480
00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.240
Amen.

481
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.480
Can you honor ecclesiastically.

482
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:15.440
I consider it the task
of our generation

483
00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.720
and I believe that T체bingen can
play a major role in this.

484
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.320
That is already not
everything on the tape anymore.

485
00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.160
We have to go out to
say goodbye, Mr. Palmer.

486
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.560
* Applause *

487
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:35.600
If you please go to your
distance to your seat.

488
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.800
Yes, Mr. Palmer, thank you
for the interview, uh ...

489
00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.480
I'm sorry, I don't see
no constructive perspective.

490
00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.520
I do not recognize
in your questions either.

491
00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:51.320
But good that we
talked to each other.

492
00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.960
Was that good? - Yes.

493
00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:55.800
You confronted me
with your prejudices

494
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.600
and I could say
what I think about it.

495
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:02.920
Do you think the format is good?
Was not funny, but good.

496
00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.440
Funny it should not be.

497
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.920
After all, we invite people
who we or I do not understand.

498
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.640
I don't know,
whether you understand me better.

499
00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:15.760
Your questions were more an effort to misunderstand
to misunderstand me.

500
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:19.000
I am firmly convinced
that you are using a scam.

501
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.320
I cannot invalidate this, but it is
not so. - Sure, it is denied.

502
00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.040
Why should I say yes,
if it's not true?

503
00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:29.880
When it was in the paper, you weren't there.
You were not there. Were you there today?

504
00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.400
I'll watch the show,
if I was there.

505
00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:34.520
All right, take care, neighbors.

506
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.600
Bye!

507
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:38.240
* Applause *

508
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.520
* Charles Aznavour:
"For me formidable" *

509
00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:47.480
* Music and applause *

510
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.880
# You are the one for me, for me

511
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.280
# For me, formidable

512
00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:05.000
# You are my love
very, very, veritable

513
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.640
* Music ends *

514
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:10.000
What actually says
the green pocket square?

515
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.280
Wanted to suck up a little.

516
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:17.000
I'll tell Robert. - With the Greens,
they can't stand.

517
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.400
Is good.
If now already journalists

518
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:23.120
green scarves as posture signs
wear, we have won.

519
00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.280
I am not a journalist at all.

520
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.600
Oh, I see, sorry
for the wrong classification.

521
00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:32.160
What is your profession?
I am a grand seigneur.

522
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.480
I can't keep up with that.
Can you hit me again?

523
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:40.720
No, I wanted to know your profession.

524
00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.720
Can you make it through the glass?
I don't know how strong it is.

525
00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:48.560
No, if I'm misjudging you professionally
I'm sorry if I'm misjudging you professionally.

526
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.320
I am still searching.

527
00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.480
If you don't ask me anything,
I can say nothing.

528
00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.600
That's the plan. - Yes.

529
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:07.160
No question, no answer.

530
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.560
Take care!

531
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.200
* Applause *

532
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.960
* Music resumes *

533
00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:20.760
# You are the one for me, for me

534
00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:23.160
# For me, formidable

535
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:28.240
# You are my love very,
very, very...

536
00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:30.240
Is closing time, can go.

537
