00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:02.960
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.600
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.000
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable #

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.000
(Berlin dialect)
Let's have a look then,

6
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.760
what the cat
has put in front of our door.

7
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.680
Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre,
46 years old,

8
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.320
Writer,
journalist and presenter.

9
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.680
Became known at the age of 23
through his book "Soloalbum".

10
00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.000
Directly at the age of 41, the next
The next bestseller: "Panikherz.

11
00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.200
Mr. von Stuckrad-Barre?

12
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.920
Yes.
Would we be ready?

13
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.480
Yeah, what do you want me to do?
We're on first name terms, right?

14
00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.880
Yes, as you ... as you want.

15
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.480
Coming in.
Can we smoke here?

16
00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.000
Now please wait
until I come in,

17
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.640
that requires a bigger announcement,
that must be made.

18
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.920
Otherwise, it goes to the legal department.
All right.

19
00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.720
Do we have everything? Yes.

20
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.800
* He sighs. *

21
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.520
Hello, good day first.
Hello.

22
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.160
Have you been vaccinated?
Yes, three times already.

23
00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.520
Really three times already.
Three times?

24
00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.760
The booster, yes.

25
00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.400
So we have two problems.

26
00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.640
I am in the process of
I am in the process of giving up smoking.

27
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.720
Why is that?
I now have these electric,

28
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.080
we are not allowed to mention the name.

29
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.000
The second problem is,
if you want to smoke,

30
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.360
you may only do so,
if you are a fictional character.

31
00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
Yes, but ...

32
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.520
I may give you as a
real existing human being

33
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.120
also offer nothing.

34
00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.040
But I am
a fictional character since 1975.

35
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.000
What is your name?
Benjamin von Stuckrad-Barre.

36
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.560
You can't,
you have to do something else...

37
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.680
(whispers) Something.
Stucki.

38
00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.640
Peter.
Stucken. Peter.

39
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.040
Peter.
Peter Pan.

40
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.960
Peter.
Peter. (laughs)

41
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.640
Yes.

42
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.360
(whispers) I would like
smoke myself now.

43
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.320
My cigarettes
are in the checkroom.

44
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.280
I only have these things here.
What are they like?

45
00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.760
And with that ...
This.

46
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.760
It's like a USB flash drive,

47
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.920
It lacks that archaic quality,
the making of fires and so on.

48
00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.000
That's not so bad.
Shall we talk about drugs and stuff?

49
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.640
Gladly.

50
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.800
I was actually thinking
that we start with dying.

51
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.600
Start with dying
I find offensive, good.

52
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.760
You've done a lot of drugs.

53
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.560
I have also
so much into it,

54
00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.720
that I thought that I
not get older than 30.

55
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.200
I have never
so pathetically.

56
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.840
But ...

57
00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.720
I had already ...

58
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.200
When I realized
I had to stop,

59
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.000
was such a point when I realized:
I don't care.

60
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.120
That was a little scary,
that I really

61
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.640
did not develop any feelings
towards the thought,

62
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.720
maybe it's over in a moment.

63
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.680
I always thought: It can't go on
go on like this for 30-40 years.

64
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.720
I also thought ...
I thought until 30.

65
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.640
I thought, after that ...
I can not become 32.

66
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.880
I can imagine a comeback
at a ripe old age.

67
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.920
I find that ...
but the same applies to smoking,

68
00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.280
now it is good not to smoke
or wear colorful jackets.

69
00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.920
Now come the 20-40 years,
where this is not good.

70
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.760
Do you have a multifunctional jacket
already?

71
00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.200
Already? Why already?
From age, you mean?

72
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.640
This is a sign of age.
No, no function at all.

73
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.520
Do you have a reversible jacket?
My jackets can't do anything.

74
00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.840
Um, I'm turning 47 now,
you are 46?

75
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.040
I turn 47 at the end of January.

76
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.840
We both thought
that we would be dead by the time we were 30.

77
00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.520
Not me.
No?

78
00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.160
I think now: I am 47,
have I done something wrong?

79
00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.360
I can be happy,
that I am still alive.

80
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.560
I think you look better now
look better than you did 10 years ago.

81
00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.360
Yes?
You are much more beautiful.

82
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.440
This is serious,
that you have become more beautiful.

83
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.400
Uh, thanks.
Honestly.

84
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.160
You don't hear that often
from colleagues: Praise.

85
00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.040
That one says, for example:
You are a beautiful man.

86
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.960
Men don't often say that.

87
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.880
I also think
that you are a beautiful man.

88
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.840
But you don't hear that very often.
Yes.

89
00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.040
That men say to each other:
"You have a hot ass."

90
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.880
I think your face is beautiful.
Just as an example.

91
00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.200
"You have a hot ass",
that's not what men say.

92
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.800
You recently posted a photo of yourself,
basically naked.

93
00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.720
I thought that was insanely great,
that you did that.

94
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.840
That was because it gets on my
on the nerves with this ...

95
00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.400
I just look the way I look.
Yes.

96
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.960
But I also had the phase
when I was at the Ku'damm, for example,

97
00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.160
there was a beautiful woman,
then I pulled in the belly.

98
00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.760
At some point I thought to myself:
"Are you stupid?"

99
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:34.640
Yes, I always think,
I'm too fat, that's so ...

100
00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:38.040
Unfortunately, this is
such an issue with me.

101
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.560
I found this so liberating,
when you posted that:

102
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.720
"Stop body shaming.
Everyone looks the way they look."

103
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.120
I thought that was great.
Yes, because that's the way it is.

104
00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:53.560
We are the generation,
who became awake with posters,

105
00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.240
where beautiful women are on it,
who were all thin.

106
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.880
Beautiful men too, yes.

107
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.160
This does not represent reality,
and then to say ...

108
00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.920
Are you a fan of reality?
Yes, with time that comes now.

109
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.080
What is your depression status?

110
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.000
I take medication.

111
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.680
Which one do you use?

112
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.560
I don't know, organic thingy stuff.
Organic?

113
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.120
I do not know
how it is pronounced.

114
00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.160
But prescription?
That is important.

115
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.440
It keeps you awake, it makes you awake.
Very good.

116
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.440
There is yes ...
Yes, there are both.

117
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.880
Mirtazapine makes you sleepy.
You have to be careful.

118
00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.360
And it wakes me up.
Does it? Paradoxical reaction.

119
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.200
I have to take this in the morning.

120
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.960
I'll whistle them in,
then you really feel: huh, huh!

121
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.840
I take one in the morning,
one in the evening.

122
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.800
But to stay awake
and to sleep then?

123
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.080
It works,
I can sleep better.

124
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.200
I can't sleep otherwise.

125
00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.920
I went to bed today
at 8 o'clock in the morning.

126
00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.600
But sleep hygiene
is very important!

127
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.440
But how do I do that?

128
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.600
Fixed hours, no cell phone,
no blue light.

129
00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:13.360
I always watch television.
Rituals, television, with timer?

130
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:18.600
Do you watch trash:
"Summer House of the Stars" or something?

131
00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:20.640
Yes, "Hart aber fair," for example.

132
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.560
(laughs) That's too grungy for me.

133
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.880
We're going to take a leap now.

134
00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.040
We'll cut it together in a way
that it comes across well for you.

135
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.560
Okay.
We're talking about journalism.

136
00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.680
You started at the "taz",
at some point you

137
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.560
switched to Springer, why?
For image reasons.

138
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.960
But why?

139
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.160
I'm a battlefield enthusiast.

140
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.880
I like to look at
everything from the inside.

141
00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.640
When are you going to Springer?

142
00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.120
Fifteen years ago or so.

143
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.160
I do not really get along with Springer
until today.

144
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.800
But you know.

145
00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.320
But I am in the process
feeling my way around it.

146
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.560
The format is that I
invite people from time to time,

147
00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:14.560
who I find abysmally shit,
but still talk to them.

148
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.560
Thank you for inviting me.
No, I love you.

149
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.200
I really like you.
We do not know each other.

150
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:23.480
You are a new category,
we are not friends,

151
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.520
but you are
not an asshole either.

152
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.080
I like to entertain myself,
just like you did 15 years ago.

153
00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:32.360
Did you enjoy that,
or was it one of those things:

154
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.960
"I'm going to Springer now,
then fuck you all"?

155
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.360
No, for me it is
in fact, it's always about that,

156
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.040
Getting to know things from the inside.

157
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.320
I think that's better,
also for the opinion-forming process.

158
00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:52.000
In the end, from the very beginning,
no matter if it was for the "taz",

159
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.800
the "Stern" or
with Harald Schmidt etc. was:

160
00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.800
I have always done
what I do,

161
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:03.120
and looked where that goes.

162
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.480
That's why it's also
a bit of a difference, and...

163
00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:10.560
Well, I am
one of those battle-goers.

164
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.560
Now Springer is
a lot going on right now.

165
00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.400
I don't know that at all.

166
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.440
I don't read the newspaper that much,
I'm writing a book right now,

167
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.440
I don't read much,
I do not have the time.

168
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.200
What's going on?

169
00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:32.840
(laughs) Are you
not talk about it?

170
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.760
No, what?

171
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:42.520
If I were a lawyer, for example,
I might tell you:

172
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:48.440
"The legal situation
in the Springer case is very mined."

173
00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.800
Okay.
"Say nothing, nothing at all.

174
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:57.800
The mere naming, pictures ...,
that's your only protection."

175
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.600
* "Lindenstraßen" theme music
is played *

176
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:07.680
Isn't that
Rudi-Dutschke-Strasse?

177
00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.920
Do they exist?

178
00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.720
I hope so.

179
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.400
In 2012 you celebrated
the 100th anniversary

180
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:21.240
of Axel Springer wrote a play
written about the founder of the publishing house,

181
00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:27.040
what was performed live in front of Friedel Springer
was performed, what was going on?

182
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.840
Yes, that was ...

183
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.280
That was wonderful,
together with Ulli Waller,

184
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.960
from the St. Pauli Theater, and ...

185
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.880
... actually Marxism, the
Damage the class enemy from the inside.

186
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.880
(laughs) Was that to harm?

187
00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:46.960
No, that was...
I can't imagine...

188
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:53.040
No, you can have the approach,
you do not understand,

189
00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.680
then I wish
good luck on Twitter.

190
00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:59.480
Or you watch it
and talk about it afterwards.

191
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:01.960
That thing was absolutely good,
that was funny.

192
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:05.160
I have always been
always thrilled me.

193
00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.240
Sigfrid Unseld,

194
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.520
Bucerius,

195
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.760
Springer, Augstein,

196
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:19.280
these ... Economy miracle captains
interest me very much, all of them.

197
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:24.360
There we would both
after half a day of those,

198
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.960
if you read it like this
in the books,

199
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.600
diaries and such,
we'd both have to go to a home,

200
00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.200
but they had this
zero-hour experience and thought:

201
00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:37.000
"Now I'm putting
all the life in there."

202
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.800
They have always interested me
interested in these figures.

203
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.840
Do you want something to drink?

204
00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.680
That doesn't come a second too soon,
the question.

205
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:50.080
I'm a little afraid of that,
the foam is madness.

206
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.800
Is that urine?

207
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:55.280
This is a urine sample that
to the doctor tomorrow.

208
00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.760
I snack on it because I don't
I don't want to go to the refrigerator.

209
00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.600
I did that once,
by mistake.

210
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.720
What?
I used to ...

211
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.760
Eigenurine therapy
is also a nice question.

212
00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.120
Yes.
Wait a minute: Cut!

213
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.360
Mr. von Stuckrad von Barre,

214
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.400
have you ever thought about
self-urine therapy?

215
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.640
Yes, that's what Carmen Thomas
raised at the time, I think.

216
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.160
Do you put it on your face?
Do you drink it?

217
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.320
About Sebastian Kurz it is said,
that he is an amulet, or Strache,

218
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:35.880
one of these Austrians
has a self urine amulet.

219
00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.160
(laughs) Self-urine amulet?

220
00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.200
Yes, in Austria the
the scandals always work much better.

221
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.960
This is a funny country.

222
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.880
Would that also work in Germany?
this Sebastian Kurz story,

223
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.800
that he's going to get himself fucked up,
because he fucked up...

224
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.960
That because of an SMS sleazy
People get kicked out of somewhere because of a text message,

225
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.520
that probably only exists
only in Austria.

226
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:07.000
Oh, you mustn't say anything about it.
For self-therapy again ...

227
00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.680
I have accidentally once
actually drunk some.

228
00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.280
I was in a clinic,
to wean myself off drugs,

229
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.360
then I had "social exposure",
that on weekends

230
00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:24.960
times goes into the city and
makes attempts in the free life.

231
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.200
The case was
somewhat short term thought:

232
00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.920
"Cool, I can shoot myself
shoot away again."

233
00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.640
I had not yet
arrived in therapy.

234
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.680
Do you want to say in which clinic?
In Germany?

235
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.000
It was in Germany,
in southern Germany.

236
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:45.120
Then I thought, clever,

237
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.840
they do a urine sample,
when you come back,

238
00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.480
that's why I have
in such a Volvic bottle ...

239
00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:55.920
... so already times ...
... pre-tupped.

240
00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.000
Exactly, vorggetuppert,
before the intoxication occurred.

241
00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.880
Quite ready I thought it not,
as I in the underpants then

242
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:06.720
have the bottle,
but that was the plan.

243
00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.440
But then I
fell asleep at some point.

244
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:14.600
Then at night,
when you have fire like that,

245
00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.360
takes the bottle,
very unpleasant.

246
00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:21.440
When you drank the Schultheiss can
drank in the morning, full of ash ...

247
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.640
I know that, not nice.
These are lonely moments.

248
00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.320
Are you clean now?

249
00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:31.520
I do not take drugs
and do not drink alcohol.

250
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.800
So just smoking?
Smoking, exactly.

251
00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:37.280
For me it is also the last thing,
thing I do is smoke.

252
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.360
That you still work a little
against the body.

253
00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.960
But what do we do then?

254
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.960
What are you doing now?
Do you have a book planned?

255
00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.720
I ...

256
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.320
That's right, I'm going to
write a book.

257
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.680
You wrote "solo album",
then "Panikherz", so books like that...

258
00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.400
In between also a few.

259
00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:01.440
I just wanted to say that these were
very autobiographical books,

260
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:08.160
that hit the ground running, because you only wrote
about that time.

261
00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.160
Actually "Method Acting"
as a writer.

262
00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.640
Honestly ...
You said that once:

263
00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.920
That you can only write what you have experienced,
what you have experienced.

264
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.040
Yes, before biographical stations
are queried:

265
00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:27.640
It is with me artistically
an approach saturated with experience.

266
00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:30.240
I can't
think up things so well,

267
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.760
that's why I go to extremes,
working for the "taz," for example.

268
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.200
I would wish for you
20 years from now, if you ever

269
00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.320
such an experience report book
you write,

270
00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:45.960
then nothing with drugs.
No, that can ... um...

271
00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:47.800
So about crashes and stuff.

272
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:52.720
Last Christmas
I listened to the audio book "Panikherz",

273
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.600
over days,
every day cooking and stuff.

274
00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.360
I had already become
horny at the drug excesses.

275
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.640
On the other hand
I had moments where I thought,

276
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.000
if I knew
where he lives, I'd run there,

277
00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.440
I'm gonna punch you in the face and I'm gonna say:
"Stop that shit!"

278
00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:16.800
That is good,
One would like to have such readers.

279
00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.680
That is why I would like to see,

280
00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.840
Can I say it?
Of course.

281
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.120
I wish that such a book
such a book no longer exists.

282
00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.160
That there is something else,
please not the other extreme,

283
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.240
that you then write
about healing stones or something,

284
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.080
that you with white robes
just running around.

285
00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:39.800
But that there is something coming...
But man...

286
00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:43.360
I would like to look forward to it.
But that's not how you lay it out.

287
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:47.520
I would also say now ...

288
00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:51.880
I have not written
written "Solo Album II",

289
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.680
not even "Panic Heart II",
I would also say,

290
00:16:54.840 --> 00:17:00.120
the next book should be about something
something else, I think so too.

291
00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:04.480
But I have since then also,
that sounds slightly desperate,

292
00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.480
I have since
published two other books,

293
00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.440
in which this is not the point,
a small one, for example, from being sober.

294
00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.360
I look at my life
so behind,

295
00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:21.120
when enough is gathered, I drive into the sun
into the sun and write it down.

296
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.920
How do we end it now?

297
00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:29.600
I was a little scared
of the show, to be honest.

298
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.680
I was also afraid to talk about death,
drugs and diseases.

299
00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.760
Since I spoke last year
talked about the depression,

300
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:41.000
I'm afraid that I'm going to make
I'm going to do a shocking talk show here,

301
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.040
where you invite people over
and talk about diseases.

302
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.320
It is the most beautiful theme.
Do you think so?

303
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:50.920
Diseases are a good topic.
You go to the doctor often, don't you?

304
00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:53.520
I'd love to.
Do you have something then?

305
00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.840
Or are you a hypochondriac?
Or is that just routine?

306
00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.880
You can always find something
in a 46-year-old body.

307
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.640
I really like going to the doctor.

308
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.120
Are you there voluntarily or
is it like Frank Sinatra,

309
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.240
where the mafia
said at 4 o'clock at night:

310
00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.760
"Put on your toupee,
come here and sing"?

311
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.240
None of that has happened.
Okay.

312
00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.160
(laughs) No, I'm ... um...

313
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:22.000
... come from friendship
and ...

314
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.800
... go and find,
that was a good decision.

315
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:31.000
I hesitated only because I find,
that I'm fat right now.

316
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.520
That is the only reason.
You are not too fat.

317
00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:39.080
You have an eating disorder, bulimia?
Body schema disorder, that's quiet.

318
00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:42.280
Is that the same with bulimia
the same as with depression?

319
00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.760
When you say to the depressed person:
"Look at something funny."

320
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.960
And you say to someone ...
I had eating disorders.

321
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.680
If I say you're not
too fat, does that get through to you?

322
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.440
No, that's like politeness,
that's ridiculous.

323
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.800
Like this: "He's lying"?
I no longer have these symptoms.

324
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.080
I had anorexia, bulimia, etc.
That is no longer such an issue.

325
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:07.920
But it accompanies you for life.
How alcoholism?

326
00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.400
You always think:
"I'm too fat."

327
00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:14.120
One knows thereby that it is for ...

328
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:16.400
As a 46-year-old person, you think:

329
00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:20.520
"This thought still occupies me
still so much every day?

330
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.600
Is that broken!"

331
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.520
Abstract, so to speak,
from the half-total, you check that.

332
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.400
This, in turn, makes one sad.

333
00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.040
But it ...

334
00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:35.200
What really with me,
maybe with you too,

335
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.320
more becomes with aging,

336
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:43.600
is the insight and
also the empowerment,

337
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.080
to see the funny in everything, ...
Yes.

338
00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.280
... to see oneself as a
as a comic figure.

339
00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:53.720
I often leave my body,
see myself from above and ask myself:

340
00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.680
"Do you want to turn this problem screw
any further?

341
00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:00.000
Or do you want to go for a walk,
buy a kebab,

342
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.400
Meet friends?"
And then the ...

343
00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:04.240
Then I have to laugh out loud.

344
00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.640
I then also have to laugh,
nevertheless "it" thinks that yes further,

345
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.080
but one has once, so to speak
to this at a distance, so to speak.

346
00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.920
Yes.
And that is insanely pleasant.

347
00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:16.920
Then you laugh and think:
"Okay, that's just the way it is."

348
00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:19.200
But you have once
seen the joke.

349
00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:21.040
I can recommend this to everyone,

350
00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:24.560
that one perceives oneself as a
ridiculous figure is perceived.

351
00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.960
And if someone says,
you're stupid: "Yes, yourself!"

352
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:33.000
"You're not telling me anything new",
so...

353
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.960
"I am much harder on myself,
than you could be.

354
00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:40.000
It's boring."
Need critiques?

355
00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:44.240
You write a book,
you get bad reviews:

356
00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:47.920
How are you taking this?
Does it hit you?

357
00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:51.920
But you don't say that publicly?
Or don't you care?

358
00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.040
It hits me,
but I would say publicly:

359
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:59.160
"It doesn't hit me at all."
But it does hit you.

360
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:03.760
I find that as a maneuver model
also too boring.

361
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.880
I can say right away,
it hits me?

362
00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:10.000
I actually pay attention to it,
when I skim something ...

363
00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:15.440
When a book comes out,
it's like a dictatorship,

364
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.720
Where I am then told:
"You can read that."

365
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.320
Yes, "that's good."
It says, "That's awesome."

366
00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:28.320
I like to read that
and am totally happy.

367
00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.160
At the very beginning I
really read everything,

368
00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:38.840
also these annihilation things,
that doesn't get you anywhere.

369
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.880
What gets you ahead is:
"He didn't get it."

370
00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:47.160
That's a bit silly, too,
but it has helped me for years.

371
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.120
Now it's me ...
But I think in the meantime ...

372
00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:54.920
At 47, I don't care:
"If you don't like it here ..."

373
00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.080
"Yeah, then maybe you'll like
maybe the next one."

374
00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:01.520
I'm doing this for me.
... "then stay at home".

375
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:07.080
There is something for everyone.
I was just on tour.

376
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:10.800
Some evenings are good,
some are bad.

377
00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:14.520
The first few minutes
actually decide it,

378
00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.200
whether this will be really good.

379
00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:19.440
If something is slightly wrong,
then it does not work.

380
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:22.800
The first three seconds ...
... how you get in ...

381
00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.720
When something happens
that you didn't know about before,

382
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.520
and that succeeds,
then that suddenly carries you.

383
00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.440
Or it'll knock you right out.

384
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:35.600
Then you know yourself,
that this was not good now.

385
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.480
Who else is going to tell you?

386
00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.600
They don't do it for you,
They don't tell you, "Do it like this."

387
00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.760
I think it's better:
put something down, light it,

388
00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.080
and if it
is somehow found ...

389
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.280
... I already have the money.
Exactly.

390
00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:51.760
I find that ...
"Look at check!"

391
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:55.120
Do you ever,
that you sit somewhere and think:

392
00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.400
"Look at check?

393
00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:00.840
Do you do things just
for the money you say:

394
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.720
"I have to do that now"?
Do you have jobs like that?

395
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:06.760
I'm thinking right now,
I don't have jobs like that.

396
00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.760
Neither am I right now.
Gala appearances, for example?

397
00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:13.360
No, I would do that though.
Mercedes-Benz says:

398
00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.960
"Write sometime
a three-hour play

399
00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:21.400
for the new Mercedes Poletto,
or whatever they're called.

400
00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:25.680
Yes, if they pay that much, it
goes into pain and suffering categories.

401
00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.560
I did that at first ...
I am open to it.

402
00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:32.480
I performed for the company Tchibo
20 years ago.

403
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.360
They didn't listen to me.

404
00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.600
There were tables like that, where
and they didn't listen.

405
00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:41.280
In the front row there was
one loudest, where I said:

406
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.040
"Shut the fuck up,
no one can hear me."

407
00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.920
That was "Mr. Tchibo" apparently,
that was the big boss.

408
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.920
Then they had such frogs
made of sheet metal that crack like this.

409
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.200
Yes.
They all had on the table.

410
00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:58.400
Oh.
They all started cracking.

411
00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.440
600 or 800 people cracking.
Lonely, yes.

412
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:05.160
They wanted me to leave, I
said, "I'm booked for 30 min."

413
00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:08.560
That's right, you do them then.
"I'm moving on now."

414
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.960
The organizer waved
with the check, my ass:

415
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.680
"You'll get the money.
Come on down."

416
00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:17.640
Did you go through with it?
I went through with it.

417
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.920
They whistled,
booed, threw things.

418
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.120
After exactly 30 minutes
I went and said:

419
00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.320
"I'm going to have a nice cup of
Dallmayr, then I'm going home."

420
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.080
That's when I realized:
I don't want to do jobs like that.

421
00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.440
I don't want to do jobs
where I stand somewhere and think:

422
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.520
"I hate this,
but I get paid for it."

423
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.920
But ... yes.
I don't think it's beautiful.

424
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.760
But you never know.
Getting a lot of money ...

425
00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.520
What is a shit job?
For me, for example ...

426
00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.600
Such a hooker job.

427
00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.680
Let's stay with Daimler for a moment,
Daimler calls and says:

428
00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.240
"Make
a nice text about Daimler

429
00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.120
and diss
some more VW."

430
00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.480
"Crawl up our asses,
here's your money."

431
00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:06.040
That's a crap job.
How much money are we talking about?

432
00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:09.120
Hmm, 50,000 euros.

433
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.560
I would listen to what they want,
what they want.

434
00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.480
Yes?
Yes, then you do that ...

435
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.880
You don't say, "Great, so much money,
and you stay at home?"

436
00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:23.120
I don't buy it.
I've never been paid 50,000 euros.

437
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.400
But 10,000-15,000 euros,
you can already say:

438
00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:30.160
"That's a lot of money,
don't make such a fuss,

439
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.000
an old woman has to
knit for a long time."

440
00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:36.360
I always get in line,
even for little money, but I ...

441
00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:40.160
But you do great things, I've never
never seen you where I thought:

442
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.040
"Holy shit,
Stuckrad-Barre is suffering right now,

443
00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.560
he's looking at the check,
hopefully he'll get a lot of money."

444
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.640
That's sweet,
that you say that.

445
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.480
But you've already done that?

446
00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.000
Could you unfold today
or would you have said

447
00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.880
"Next time I'll come to Krömer,
but then I need 1.5 hours"?

448
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.040
No, I have today ...
Shall we become friends?

449
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.240
I am older than you, ...
I am ready.

450
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.280
... so I say, why don't you say "you"?
Yes.

451
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:13.960
I am older than you, I am
your fatherly friend now.

452
00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.400
I'd love to, I suppose.
Can I give you a hug? Sure.

453
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.200
I think that's beautiful.

454
00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:29.680
Before everyone goes crazy, we go out
we go out and say goodbye.

455
00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.320
Yup.

456
00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.040
Did you miss the audience today?

457
00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:42.080
(laughs) What now?
We are standing here now.

458
00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.200
There's always an audience here.
Yes.

459
00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:45.840
This is for me,

460
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.120
than when I go on tour,
but playing in empty theaters.

461
00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:53.280
I do everything as usual,
but there is no one there.

462
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.960
Tours are booked,
like now for example

463
00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:58.680
We say goodbye now.

464
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.600
"Glad you were there."

465
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:05.280
My new friend.
What do I call you now?

466
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:07.320
Stucki? Ben? Stucki?

467
00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:12.240
Lindenberg calls you Stucki ...
"Stuckiman" he calls me.

468
00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.240
That's what my ID card says, too.

469
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.000
Ben do you want me to say? I thought..,
I'm a friend now too.

470
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.040
Ben is very close.
Okay.

471
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.600
Well, that was
"Chez Krömer".

472
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.120
Thank you for
a very long show.

473
00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.000
If you are now thinking to yourself:

474
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:32.080
"Öh, so wild cuts,
has MTV arrived at rbb now?"

475
00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.920
Yes.
Yes.

476
00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:35.600
Bye.

477
