00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.360
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.400
This officially happened to us
happened to us in Oranienstraße.

4
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.280
"Communists had opened fire on
opened fire on Commissioner Rath and me."

5
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.160
Nobody writes:

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.520
"The police were attacked."
- We need proof of that.

7
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.880
An injured policeman.

8
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.240
The messenger always took the only copy
of the films right away.

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.280
Krajewski used to be a policeman.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.360
Thought seriously,
after the war

11
00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.240
as normal
back into service.

12
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.440
The snazzy Cologne
is for my taste

13
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.400
'A little too curious.

14
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.200
What do I have to do with it?
Find out what he's looking for here.

15
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.200
He went under the wheels.
He was not a tough guy.

16
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.240
Impersonating the criminal investigation department
to impersonate

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.840
and breaking into an apartment,
is bad.

18
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.120
You lied to me.
 No.

19
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.640
Kardakov was still at
at Sorokina's apartment last night.

20
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.840
He has not left the city
actually never left the city.

21
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.400
What do you want from me?
- Gold from the Sorokins.

22
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.880
*groans, screams

23
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200
Where does the gold come from?

24
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.280
*painful cry*

25
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.760
From Russia.

26
00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.000
And you want to use it for what?

27
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.120
*He screams.

28
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.960
Mr. Kardakov ...

29
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.160
So, stretch again.

30
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.320
*crack, scream*

31
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.960
*He exhales deeply.

32
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.160
*He groans.

33
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.840
Move.

34
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.560
Done, Edgar.
- Thank you, doctor.

35
00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.960
*He exhales deeply.

36
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.160
My country
is doomed to destruction.

37
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.000
I have to help,
to prevent this.

38
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.360
That's why I need the gold.

39
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Mhm.

40
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.520
I promise you,

41
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.880
the business
will be more than worthwhile for you.

42
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760
Please.

43
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.280
Help me.

44
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.600
*uncanny music

45
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.240
*rhythmic music

46
00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.400
(Gereon?

47
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.120
Are you already alive?

48
00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.320
Oh, sorry.

49
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.800
Désolé! Dobré ráno. Scusi.
Good morning. Would you like a newspaper?

50
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.280
"Policeman wrestled with death -
Communists continue to deny!"

51
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.360
A question at an inopportune moment?
Yes.

52
00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.400
Your colleague Dörr,
who was at the rally

53
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.440
by the communists
was shot by the communists,

54
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.960
would have been, should have been, could have been ...

55
00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.560
In any case: the whole thing
is slowly turning into a stirring piece.

56
00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:23.560
And then I thought to myself,
if you could maybe

57
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.920
the colleague's duty station
revealed ...

58
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.240
So that I could get his address.

59
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.520
At the press conference, there was
monastic silence.

60
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.520
I don't know ...
I don't even know him.

61
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240
So,

62
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.800
if you find out something

63
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.560
and gave me such details
as soon as these ...

64
00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.800
*He farts.
would come around the corner ...

65
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.800
You are the world champion in ...
subjunctive.

66
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.560
German grammar,
fantastic thing, isn't it?

67
00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.840
I am a police officer myself.

68
00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.600
But a good one.

69
00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.200
Thought it might be worth it,

70
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.800
the real truth
about May 1.

71
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.360
That's what you want too.
What makes you think that?

72
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:11.920
I can see that in your face.

73
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.160
In return I would have
Tickets for the "Plumpe".

74
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.480
How?
Stadium at the Gesundbrunnen.

75
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:19.720
Herta BSC against Holstein Kiel.

76
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.240
"Hands are only washed by hand"
in this city.

77
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.680
In your beautiful cathedral city on the Rhine

78
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:29.400
or in my modest
hometown on the Danube,

79
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.800
you just help each other
among friends.

80
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.760
Only the Berliners
don't understand that.

81
00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.160
That's bad.

82
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.240
*He closes the door.

83
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.640
What time is it?

84
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.920
Seven.

85
00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.000
For God's sake.

86
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.720
It's Sunday.

87
00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.720
*cheerful swing music*

88
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.600
*cheerful swing music*

89
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.760
*cheerful swing music*

90
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.400
*They talk and laugh.

91
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:47.120
What are you writing?
A novel.

92
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.520
Shall we go out?

93
00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.400
Just the two of us?
Yes, with pleasure.

94
00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:53.640
*laughs*

95
00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.400
You just look too funny
in your swimming dress.

96
00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.160
Where can you get one of these?
At the carpet dealer?

97
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.480
At the pawnbroker.
- Looks like a walrus.

98
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:06.720
*laughs*

99
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.280
*Someone plays the banjo
and whistles to it.

100
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:13.920
Give me that.
How is that supposed to work?

101
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.320
Look.

102
00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:19.000
(Woman) That's not possible.
- (Man) No, here.

103
00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:22.760
It won't hold at all.
- Put one on your forehead.

104
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.680
So, look!

105
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.760
Hello there.

106
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.680
Greta, Rudi.
Rudi, Greta.

107
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.480
Day.
- Day.

108
00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.240
What about bathing now?
I've already been.

109
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.200
Too bad.

110
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.360
Come on, Stefan, show us what you can do.
Stand over there.

111
00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.160
Well, excuse me.
That's silly.

112
00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.000
*She whispers.

113
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.160
Is that enough?
- Yes.

114
00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.280
And now you say something to her.
Quite normally, don't shout.

115
00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:59.640
*silently*

116
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.240
Oh, it's so cold!

117
00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.400
Well ... like this?

118
00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.520
Why don't you find out for yourselves?
you praying sisters.

119
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.480
What kind is that?

120
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.960
'a whippersnapper.

121
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.920
What did I say?

122
00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:25.400
"Ten Saxon miners pay for
twelve Czech pubs."

123
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280
And me?

124
00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.720
"Why is Jänicke dragging
proles into the club?"

125
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:31.440
Yes.
- How do you do that?

126
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.440
He can read lips.
His father is blind.

127
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.880
Deaf, you moron.

128
00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.760
(Not bad.

129
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.840
So, do you like it?

130
00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:43.160
What makes you think that?

131
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.800
Well ...

132
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.160
Competition! Mixed foursome!

133
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.400
Here we come!

134
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.200
(One!

135
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.640
Two!

136
00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.200
*swinging music*

137
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.360
"Mass shootings

138
00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.400
are a legitimate means
of the revolution."

139
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.160
Says who? Hitler?

140
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.000
Lenin.

141
00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.800
Expropriation too, by the way.

142
00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.200
Ha ...

143
00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:27.960
*Organ music

144
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.720
*Organ music

et filii et spiritus sancti."

146
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.400
(congregation sings) "Amen."

147
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.480
Mr. Rath.
I'm glad you made it.

148
00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.000
Mr. Government Councillor.
Please.

149
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.280
Today I am also a civilian.

150
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.680
Irmgard, this is Mr. Rath,
the colleague from Cologne.

151
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.160
I'm very pleased.
Has the trade fair edified you?

152
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.920
Be careful what you say,
what you say.

153
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.160
Thank you. Very nice.

154
00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.920
Something ... different
than here in the Rhineland.

155
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.400
You mean ... more controlled.

156
00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:07.720
Yes, maybe.

157
00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.560
Well, the Märkisch diaspora.

158
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:14.480
We have guests for coffee later.
If you like ...

159
00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.000
Thank you,
but I still have to work.

160
00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:20.480
I'll give you the day off.
Then ... with pleasure.

161
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.520
You let the commissioner
go first, right?

162
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:25.800
Please.

163
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000
After you.

164
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.120
Me? No, that's not for me.
It's not my club.

165
00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.000
My husband's family
is Jewish,

166
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.680
and he steadfastly refuses,
to be baptized.

167
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:04.880
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

168
00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:06.280
(Amen.

169
00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.880
God's eternal grace
can always forgive you, my son.

170
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.280
I know.

171
00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.840
Speak, my son.

172
00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.480
After the first step
the second step is easy.

173
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.480
*He exhales deeply.

174
00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.400
If you don't want to,
come back another time.

175
00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.440
The doors of this house
are always open to you.

176
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:05.720
I love my brother's wife.

177
00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.880
Does he know about it?

178
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:15.520
No.

179
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.440
He is missing.

180
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:18.880
Missing.

181
00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:25.360
Have any lewd acts occurred?
occurred?

182
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.000
Yes.

183
00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.240
For a long time?

184
00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.400
For more than ten years.

185
00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.800
That is a heavy burden.

186
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.800
The ninth commandment
is an important building block

187
00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.840
our Christian integrity.

188
00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.240
Is there more, my son?

189
00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.240
Have you actually spoken to
Stefan about the job?

190
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.520
Mhm.

191
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.240
Tell me, Stefan,
I didn't know,

192
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.000
that you know the Benda
personally.

193
00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:12.240
Of course.

194
00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:15.360
This is the chief
of the political police.

195
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:18.240
You see.
Tomorrow I'll go and introduce myself.

196
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.480
Good!

197
00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:24.560
*distant babble of voices*

198
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.480
Hey, you student!
- Ah!

199
00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:47.880
Me? Nope.

200
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.640
What are you reading Plietschs?
- Please?

201
00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.520
What are you reading?
- Just look at the pictures.

202
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.760
Ah.

203
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.400
Are you from Usedom?
- No, Darß. And you?

204
00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.400
Wismar?

205
00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:01.520
No, Stralsund.

206
00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.160
What are you doing there?
This is not your boat.

207
00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.800
We are the Kiel sailors.
- We make revolution.

208
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.480
You can't do that.
- Come with me.

209
00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.800
I can't think of any.

210
00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.360
*She whoops.

211
00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:18.800
(laughing) Help!

212
00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.160
(removed) Hey! Wait!

213
00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.200
(Quick!
- They're stealing our boat!

214
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.120
After me!
- Help me! Abduction!

215
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.640
(Wait, I'll get you!

216
00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.120
(Faster!

217
00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:35.280
What are you doing?!

218
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:37.440
(Help me! Do something!

219
00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.640
You have to get through it now!

220
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.360
*Voices become quieter.

221
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:44.200
*relaxed jazz music

222
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:52.280
(We've got rid of them.

223
00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.720
I am Fritz.
- Greta.

224
00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.720
Greta.

225
00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.200
Nice name.

226
00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.560
Otto.

227
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.000
Hello.

228
00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.280
*relaxed jazz music

229
00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.920
*The women laugh.

230
00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.880
Cold but fair.

231
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.200
*Lotte laughs.

232
00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:26.720
Tell me ...
You're studying medicine, aren't you?

233
00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:29.800
Criminal pathology with Dr. Schwarz.

234
00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.880
Do you cut open corpses
and dig inside?

235
00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.920
Almost nothing else.

236
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.240
Seriously?
 Why, yes!

237
00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:40.800
I can cut up in my sleep.

238
00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:42.240
Why do you want to know that?

239
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.520
Just like that.

240
00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.800
Maybe the two of us
have plans for later.

241
00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:49.760
So, so.

242
00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:55.160
(Woman) Please help yourself.

243
00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:59.320
I'm sorry, our maid
was married away from us.

244
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.000
Can I help you?
No, thank you.

245
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.720
A woman never forgets that.

246
00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:06.720
Rath, there you are.

247
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.280
Do you already know our
our highest employer?

248
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:13.240
We have not
not yet been introduced.

249
00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.680
Police Commissioner Zörgiebel,

250
00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.800
Commissioner Rath from Cologne.
It is an honor.

251
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.800
Rath. Son of Engelbert.

252
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.800
You still owe me
a transcript from May 1.

253
00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:27.400
That ... that is in progress.

254
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.400
The fact that you have been
and the danger,

255
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.200
the self-defense in which you and
your colleague were in,

256
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.680
cannot be emphasized enough.

257
00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.160
Tomorrow morning I expect
your written statement

258
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:43.400
to these incidents.

259
00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.560
*disturbing music*

260
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.120
*disturbing music*

261
00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.520
*screaming woman
in his thoughts*.

262
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.160
You're shaking so much.

263
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:39.480
(I'm cold too.)

264
00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.160
(Herrmann:) We need help!

265
00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:44.320
*ringing of the streetcar bell

266
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.880
*threatening music

267
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.640
*He draws the curtains.

268
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.520
You are not allowed to do that.

269
00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.480
I do.

270
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.240
*exciting music*

271
00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.480
*Shots*

272
00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:04.960
*He sighs.

273
00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:06.520
(That's it.

274
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.400
Please?

275
00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:12.840
Well, the Schupos.
That's where they fired from.

276
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.120
*Screech*

277
00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.840
And they were dead.

278
00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:18.680
(removed) 200 dead ...

279
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:25.440
But not a revolution,
says the party.

280
00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.480
*dark music*

281
00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.880
What are you doing here?

282
00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:47.480
Mr. Nowak.
Are you snooping around here?

283
00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:50.680
Excuse me ...
This is one of them.

284
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.240
A polyp?
- Yes.

285
00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.840
What did he say?
- A polyp?

286
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.480
A policeman?
- Get out, you murderer!

287
00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.760
Murderer!
- Get out of here!

288
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.680
Hands off!
Get lost, you bastard!

289
00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.280
Pig!
- Come on, let it go.

290
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.840
Next time
I'll beat you to death!

291
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.440
*Brass music

292
00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.320
Dear guests, dear comrades ...

293
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.920
I would like to welcome you all - all of you -
here at the headquarters of our family.

294
00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.200
I am particularly pleased,

295
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.560
that the landlady
is also with us today.

296
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.960
General Director Annemarie Nyssen.

297
00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:58.680
Mother.

298
00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.760
Hunting is
the man's real passion.

299
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.280
Next to the war.

300
00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.000
Today we welcome the esteemed
personal speaker

301
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.960
of the President of the Reich:
Colonel Wendt.

302
00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.880
And secondly, a great hero
of the last war:

303
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:28.000
the conqueror of Memel

304
00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:32.480
and the heroes of the battle
around Heydekrug: Major General Seegers.

305
00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.520
How did the Soviets come to
stop the delivery in Berlin?

306
00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.600
I don't know.
A smuggling operation, allegedly.

307
00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:51.440
In any case, Monday is

308
00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:54.960
a search
of the tank wagons.

309
00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.440
Why wait until Monday?

310
00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.280
You can't just
open the hatches.

311
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:02.800
You must prevent this,

312
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.280
that around this train
public around this train.

313
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.120
My name
is on the shipping documents.

314
00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.160
Exactly. Everything,
between the national border

315
00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.200
and the barracks
of the Reichswehr,

316
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.400
is your responsibility.

317
00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:17.880
They were ready,

318
00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.640
the national cause
cause.

319
00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.720
Do you know
what's at stake for me?

320
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.200
(Major General) Therefore
the stay of the train should be short.

321
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.800
If the press or the police
get wind of your activities,

322
00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:35.640
you jeopardize
the entire company.

323
00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:38.520
Give the Russians what they want,
what they want.

324
00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:40.560
We'll manage the rest.

325
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:43.320
So, and now
pull yourself together.

326
00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:46.680
We are very close to the Nyssen family
family,

327
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.200
that she makes her land
to us.

328
00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.760
And we want to take a look later,

329
00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.880
what Colonel Wendt
has prepared for us.

330
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.760
When and where
will the maneuver take place?

331
00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.720
After dark,
General.

332
00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.320
In a hollow
behind these hills.

333
00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.960
Good, well, then we still have
a little longer, eh?

334
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.600
Oh, too far.

335
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.240
*shot*

336
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.400
Please accept my apologies,
Major General.

337
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:46.640
Could not resist.

338
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:49.520
*lamenting roar*

339
00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:53.880
200 meters is probably a bit ambitious for you too
a bit ambitious for you too.

340
00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.720
On the contrary.

341
00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.520
*faint mooing*

342
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.840
We look forward to your maneuver,
Colonel.

343
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:15.760
(In the Oranienstraße
at the level of house number 8

344
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.440
stood two women
on a balcony.

345
00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.200
Shortly afterwards
several men unrolled

346
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.640
an approximately four
by six meters red flag.

347
00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.360
At the same time
the communists opened fire).

348
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.480
*exciting music*

349
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.760
*The phone rings.

350
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.320
Rath.

351
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.880
Who is there?

352
00:25:57.120 --> 00:25:59.640
*Someone whistles a tune.

353
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.400
Hello?

354
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:06.560
*whistling, rushing line

355
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:10.600
*Noise

356
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680
*Crack*

357
00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:14.000
Hello?

358
00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:23.440
*exciting music*

359
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.240
*remote detonations

360
00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:41.280
*distant shouts*

361
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.480
*Nyssen sighs.

362
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.240
This is the hope
Germany.

363
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:54.360
How many men are there?

364
00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.320
(man) 4000.

365
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:02.520
A very special maneuver.

366
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:04.320
Yes?

367
00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:08.400
We call it
"Operation Pillory Day".

368
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.960
*calm, serious music

369
00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.400
*muffled murmur*

370
00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.000
(muffled)
Helmut is up on the horse,

371
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.960
straight down
to this basement pub.

372
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.760
At the counter.

373
00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.880
*She sobs quietly.

374
00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:38.920
Bruno?

375
00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:41.200
May I interrupt for a moment?

376
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.800
I'll be right back.

377
00:27:56.720 --> 00:27:59.240
The anniversary of Helmut's death today.

378
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.320
He was in my company.

379
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.600
Died in the battle
around Zillebeke.

380
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.520
That was a good one.

381
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:22.960
The Behnke.

382
00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.640
Bruno?

383
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.920
Hmm?

384
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:41.680
I need your help.

385
00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.560
King?

386
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:50.680
Finally.

387
00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.800
I have to find Krajewski.

388
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:02.440
He is the key.

389
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.960
Well, here we go.

390
00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:30.920
*exciting music*

391
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.280
*He coughs.

392
00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.560
*Sizzle

393
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.120
*exciting music*

394
00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.480
What do you want? I need something!

395
00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.520
Who do you bring the material to?
you pick up from the copying plant?

396
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:17.720
Which ma... material?

397
00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.680
They're killing me, man.

398
00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.760
Where is the movie?

399
00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.400
Patience.

400
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.240
We have time, he doesn't.

401
00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:40.880
*exciting music*

402
00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:50.840
Now you can see,

403
00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.760
how long you
you can manage without drugs.

404
00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.200
And if you need something,
you shout: "Waiter!".

405
00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.280
Colleague here will come and get us.

406
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:03.680
Look what I have for you here
for you when you talk.

407
00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.000
That ... is too weak for me.
I need something stronger.

408
00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.240
I see.

409
00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.200
I thought,
that would be just the thing ...

410
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.160
for you flappers.

411
00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.000
I need something stronger.

412
00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.440
Please.

413
00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:29.160
*He breathes frantically.

414
00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:31.360
*Door closes.

415
00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:36.960
As you can see,

416
00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:40.480
there are also broken vending machines,
that can think.

417
00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.240
Without a doubt.
And you are living proof.

418
00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.240
And with your stuff,
you've got yourself under control, yeah?

419
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:52.360
You tell me.
You know me by now.

420
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.320
If that comes out,
you're out.

421
00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.680
Do you think I'm
a bad cop?

422
00:31:58.920 --> 00:31:59.920
*He groans.

423
00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:02.640
Oh, come on.
Let me kiss you.

424
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:05.160
You're my favorite cop.

425
00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:08.520
I'm serious.
 Ouch!

426
00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.320
*Wolter groans.

427
00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.320
*Wolter laughs.

428
00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.400
Ah!

429
00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.240
Id.

430
00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:29.720
The idiot is you.

431
00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.240
Because you didn't trust me.

432
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.840
Whoo!

433
00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.800
*Wolter laughs.

434
00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:48.120
Ah, man, do I have a fire!

435
00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.440
Comm.

436
00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:55.840
*He sighs.

437
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.280
*removed voices*

438
00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:08.800
We have two hours left.

439
00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.720
*exciting music*

440
00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.920
Hello?

441
00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:35.200
Hands up!
- What's going on now?

442
00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680
Fins up!

443
00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.440
Give me your weapons!
- Put them down!

444
00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.200
Get down!
- Get down!

445
00:34:12.200 --> 00:34:13.960
*exciting music*

446
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:43.120
Yes.

447
00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:45.280
Then let's go.

448
00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:46.920
Come and see us.

449
00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.000
*exciting music*

450
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:35.720
*He groans.

451
00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.520
*hiss*

452
00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.440
This is gas.

453
00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:46.320
Gas! Gas!

454
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.360
(several men) Gas!

455
00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:54.120
Get out of here.
- Everybody out of here!

456
00:35:54.360 --> 00:35:55.400
Out, out, out!

457
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600
Ah!

458
00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.360
Everybody out!

459
00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:02.760
*Alert

460
00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.400
*He groans.

461
00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:07.800
(man) Put on your gas masks!
- Stand still!

462
00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.120
*He gasps for breath.

463
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.480
*He gasps.

464
00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.320
(Come on, come here.
We have to take him with us.

465
00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:20.920
*Kardakov gasps.

466
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.440
*He gasps for breath.

467
00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.200
Quick, paramedics!

468
00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:38.000
Hold on! Hang in there!

469
00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:45.440
Is this the dead Russian?

470
00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:47.600
Yes.

471
00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.360
(quietly) Will you close
the door, please?

472
00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.440
Take the feet,
they're just about stable.

473
00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.200
Wat?
a bit heavy?

474
00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:08.400
Yes, you're right, I'll
secludition first.

475
00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:16.440
*She sighs.

476
00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.400
*flowing air

477
00:37:31.960 --> 00:37:33.320
Oh, shit!

478
00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:35.200
Close your nose!
What then?

479
00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.840
Face mask!

480
00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:45.320
*quiet music

481
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.360
*She sniffs.

482
00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:01.840
Kiss me.

483
00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.800
Better?

484
00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.840
And now?
First we make the bloodbath here.

485
00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:22.120
And then I'll show you my place.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

486
00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:30.920
*Cardakov breathes hard.

487
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.840
Go directly to Dr. Schmidt.

488
00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.280
(Rudi) So, my lady,
we're about to start.

489
00:38:58.520 --> 00:38:59.680
Just a moment.

490
00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:01.280
*He groans.

491
00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.960
Black mamba. But right.

492
00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:07.600
What does that mean?

493
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.880
Well, come here,
take a look.

494
00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.520
Here. Coal lung.

495
00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.520
The man has either
worked underground,

496
00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.560
or he was a railroad worker.

497
00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:35.320
Well, he wasn't a miner.
Not with his hands.

498
00:39:35.560 --> 00:39:36.920
*votes*

499
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.440
Holy shit!

500
00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800
Give us a hand!

501
00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:44.840
(Are they stupid? Get me
me out of the opera performance.

502
00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.320
That would have been possible tomorrow
would have worked tomorrow.

503
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.520
Then we should have
in the freezer ...

504
00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:53.560
And now what?
 In there!

505
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.880
The clothes!

506
00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
(quietly) Hurry up, they're coming!
Go, go, go!

507
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.400
*Voices come closer.

508
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:15.280
There was a chemical accident
tonight.

509
00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.440
A railroad car
has gone up,

510
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.480
at the Anhalter freight station.

511
00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:23.000
(quietly) Railroad.

512
00:40:23.240 --> 00:40:27.200
(Black) Were you at the front?
- 223rd Infantry Division.

513
00:40:27.440 --> 00:40:28.520
Why?

514
00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:31.800
I've seen this a thousand times.

515
00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.160
Looks very
like a gas attack.

516
00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.320
Well, let's go for the lungs

517
00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:39.120
once for warfare agents
for warfare agents.

518
00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.160
*quiet music

519
00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400
(Russian railroad worker.

520
00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.280
Gas attack.

521
00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.120
Anhalter Bahnhof.)

522
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.640
*she sighs.

523
00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.280
Well, Inspector?

524
00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.800
So, everything all right?

525
00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.160
Yes.

526
00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:14.440
All ladies registered?
Yes.

527
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:18.200
Then everything is perfect.
You know that.

528
00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:21.840
Exemplary establishment.

529
00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:27.800
My best regards to the boss.

530
00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:45.560
Has your commissioner
quite a nuisance,

531
00:41:45.800 --> 00:41:47.160
that with medicine.

532
00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:49.240
You promised.
 What?

533
00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.000
The certificate of good conduct.
Flowery white.

534
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.360
Someone has to find it first,
your little paper.

535
00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.680
I want to go to the police, Bruno.

536
00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.680
Why is that?

537
00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:05.920
Because I know I can do it.

538
00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:07.520
Determine?

539
00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.240
Yes.

540
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:12.400
Well, then find out
the snoop.

541
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.600
Then you will also get
your certificate of good conduct.

542
00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:20.280
Well, the Cologne
is certainly not.

543
00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.400
But nevertheless, someone
rummaged through my desk.

544
00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:25.640
The day before yesterday.

545
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:29.400
*exciting music*

546
00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:39.760
*incomprehensible mumbling*

547
00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:45.000
His condition is unstable.

548
00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:52.120
(weakly)
The train is full of gold.

549
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:56.240
Only Svetlana knows.

550
00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.800
Take a rest.

551
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.800
The train is full ...

552
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:02.520
Increase the dose:

553
00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:05.960
six milligrams
epoxy-N-methylmorphinan.

554
00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.840
*incomprehensible mumbling*

555
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.240
Will he get through?

556
00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:22.520
Yes.

557
00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.320
*Gong*

558
00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:40.480
Why did you believe the man
believed him?

559
00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:43.120
I know him,
he wouldn't lie.

560
00:43:49.960 --> 00:43:51.160
Comrades!

561
00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:54.920
Stand still!

562
00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.920
*suspicious trumpet music*
