00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
.

00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.560
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.960
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.240
# You are my love
very, very, veritable

5
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.360
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.000
* (clears throat)

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
Tedros Teclebrhan,
37 years old.

8
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.000
Everybody loves him.

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.000
Today made me
really all mad,

10
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.400
because everyone is happy,
that he is coming:

11
00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.240
"... he is coming, Teddy is coming,
Teddy is coming..."

12
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.920
No one was interested
for me anymore.

13
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.600
But then that's just the way it is.

14
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.520
The reason that everyone loves him
and he is so well known,

15
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.640
lies, we look at
the video times, at it.

16
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.200
Who is Germany's Chancellor?

17
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.440
This is the ...,
boah, shut up, wait...

18
00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.080
uh, something Angelo,

19
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.200
Angelo Mer..., Merte.

20
00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.720
Who was Chancellor in Germany before Angelo Merte?
Chancellor in Germany?

21
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.200
Uh, boah ...

22
00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.680
Boah, I think, uh, have ke...

23
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.640
but can it be,
Hitler, can it be?

24
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.200
Before Angelo was Hitler, ge'?

25
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.080
Yeah, yeah. Whoa, hey, I say
all the questions right, yo.

26
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.840
What is the capital
of Germany.

27
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Boah ey, you come to me
with such tricky questions, yo.

28
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.360
Luxembourg.

29
00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.160
You're an asshole,
you always got me by the balls, yo.

30
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.920
The video is almost 10 years old,
40 million clicks on YouTube.

31
00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.600
Uh, pfff, yeah right.

32
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.680
Many colleagues click
thousands of times on such a video,

33
00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.440
until they have generated a viral
generated.

34
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.840
Teddy, are you there yet? - Yes.

35
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.760
I'm coming in, okay? - Come.

36
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.920
I'm a little excited,
I have to say.

37
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.200
Not me at all. - Nope?

38
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.160
I am easily bored.

39
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.440
I'm coming in, right? - Yes.

40
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.240
* (clears throat)

41
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.280
Like this.
* laughs exaggeratedly *

42
00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.360
I'm really a little excited,

43
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.520
because we know each other
and because you're not an asshole.

44
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.640
I have seen all the shows,
because I am also a fan.

45
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.240
You took apart the people
who were here.

46
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.080
After all, that's easy.

47
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.560
If one comes,
I do not know him,

48
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.320
then they get
verbally on the face, so.

49
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.680
But with you I have
so bite inhibitions, you know?

50
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.440
There's also nothing where you say,
he's an asshole.

51
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.120
I suggest you just do it,
if it gets too much for me,

52
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.440
I say: Hey stop,
up to here, but no further.

53
00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.320
So I'll yell at you then.

54
00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.080
You whore. - You miserable whore.

55
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.840
Is it okay to say that in BR, whore?
I think not.

56
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.280
On Bavarian radio, you mean?

57
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.600
Where are we exactly?
Please explain that to us.

58
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.640
In which city ...

59
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.520
In which city ... I beg your pardon?
What city are we in? Rbb!

60
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.240
I thought right away,
something does not fit.

61
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.080
Me like this: BR, no?

62
00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.680
What's that again?
Yes, say it please,

63
00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.680
that the viewers at home ...
So I thought we were in BR.

64
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.640
Yes. - Then I noticed at that moment
by the look on your face,

65
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.400
ah-ah, i'm wrong.

66
00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.040
Neighborhood, almost.
It's the NDR, isn't it?

67
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.640
Whoa-bap-bap, give me a second.

68
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.360
Hey, give me a break.

69
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.040
I know what it is.

70
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.240
You don't know
which station I work at?

71
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.240
Yes, yes, I do.

72
00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.960
But since it is a show
and you want to entertain,

73
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.680
I have simply times ...

74
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.440
You don't know what station
I've been working for for 100,000 years.

75
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.120
Airbnb?

76
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.560
Yes, here you can
also rent apartments, exactly.

77
00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.200
Nah, BRB.

78
00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.800
I feel totally stupid,
because you're private now.

79
00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.600
You came in here like this,
you're private. - Yes.

80
00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.920
I am now quasi,
I'm in disguise.

81
00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.280
You are the great Kurt Krömer.

82
00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.920
Yes, I am now a fictional character,

83
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.480
Talk with a real
real person, you know?

84
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.200
It's like when
I come home

85
00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.720
and my wife
is dressed as a squirrel.

86
00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.960
That is not so,
so there Realtalk does not work.

87
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.760
Yes, sure, there you have
you're up for something different.

88
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.320
Yes, to the real person.
Or on something else, Kurt.

89
00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.200
The woman behind the mask.

90
00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.440
When my wife,
of the three I have,

91
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.600
as a squirrel at my house
waiting at home and says: "Come in".

92
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.240
* Smacking *

93
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.720
Yes, with a nut like that in your hand.

94
00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.080
Then I say:
Yup, I'm already there.

95
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.440
Chip, chip, chip, bonsch-äp.

96
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.840
You wouldn't say ...?

97
00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.160
Yes, I would say I am there.

98
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.080
I would put on my leggings
put on my tank top.

99
00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.160
I disenchant myself a little bit,
as I am in private.

100
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.880
Looks good.

101
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.200
That's how we know each other, right? - Yes.

102
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.040
I know you actually
with 3 buttons open. - Here like this, 'ne?

103
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.280
Enrique-like. - Nonchalant.

104
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.080
* exhales audibly *

105
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.480
Origin.
Where are you actually from?

106
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.040
Uh, where are my roots?
Always the stupid question, 'ne?

107
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.400
You can say anything,
then I ask where originally.

108
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.680
Okay. - Where exactly?
Then say again.

109
00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.000
That's what's so
what's so annoying, isn't it?

110
00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.320
I don't get annoyed when
someone asks me where I'm from.

111
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.960
What do you say when you are asked,
where you come from?

112
00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:13.600
I always say I grew up
in Germany, come from Eritrea.

113
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.920
Then people ask,
oh no, it doesn't work anymore.

114
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:21.160
Nah, when I put it that way.
I ask before what I just said:

115
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:24.400
Where my roots are
or where I grew up.

116
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.640
You came to Germany,
you were 7 months old. - Mm-hm.

117
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.640
You can't remember
don't remember it at all.

118
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.240
Yes, but I say I'm German,
I have the feeling that something is missing.

119
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.960
People think
that something is missing, right?

120
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.720
Me too, for my feeling.

121
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.760
Germany is my home.

122
00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.760
But if I say I am German,
then there is a part missing.

123
00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.600
Where did you live then?
In Stuttgart, right?

124
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.840
No, still behind Tübingen,
on the border to the Swabian Alb.

125
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.880
Then you are from Tübingen.
No, Tübingen district.

126
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.360
I am Mössinger. - Mössinger?
Why are you laughing, listen?

127
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.360
How did you grow up there?

128
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:07.560
When I imagine,

129
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.760
Alexander Beutzahn
grows up near Tübingen.

130
00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720
Quite normal.
Villa ...

131
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.720
Quite normal, standard,
Swabian standard.

132
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.000
Villa, Mercedes station wagon,

133
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.080
because Mercedes is in Stuttgart.

134
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:28.840
And otherwise had everything, stop rich.

135
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.680
I grew up very rich.

136
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.560
Your mother
took care of you. - Exactly.

137
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.520
You have several siblings.
Yes, 2 brothers.

138
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.960
What were you like as children?
Bastards.

139
00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.200
So 3 full crazy kids.
No, so...

140
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.120
I was an asshole kid.
Then you understand what I mean.

141
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.120
I have only one sister,
who was normal,

142
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:56.800
but I was
really an asshole child,

143
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.320
where one was ashamed,
when family came.

144
00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.800
Were you that antisocial?
I was a real asshole.

145
00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:08.040
Then you went to an acting school.
school. How old were you then?

146
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.880
25 ... - 25?

147
00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:12.200
Nah, wait a minute, wait a minute, nah.

148
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.280
Yes, I think 24, 25.

149
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:22.960
Did you know what you had to do?
I used to watch videos, too.

150
00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:26.080
I am from
a classic working-class family.

151
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.960
We had no contacts
with actors.

152
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.800
Then I sat down
with it times apart.

153
00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:35.640
It was so sad and tragic.
They then fenced like that.

154
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:37.880
Then there were funny game scenes,

155
00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:41.480
where I thought I wanted to
right in front of the TV camera.

156
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.440
I wanted to be like Louis de Funes
and there was no school for that.

157
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.200
I would not know either,
what is being presented there.

158
00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.760
How did you do that there?

159
00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.440
I went to the entrance exam ...

160
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:58.120
I'm quite naive about it.
I've never been to the theater either.

161
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.400
I had no idea,
as you describe.

162
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.880
I googled "acting school."
because people said:

163
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.520
You need to get on stage.

164
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.560
I did not know until then
that there was an acting school.

165
00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:12.200
I was naive, no plan.

166
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:16.560
Then I googled and the
more beautiful website I called.

167
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.000
No joke now.
Because the makeup was beautiful.

168
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.840
The structure was better,
there I apply.

169
00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.600
Then you went
and then you ...?

170
00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:28.360
Then they gave me
given me a scene

171
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.080
and I am
the worst reader.

172
00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.160
Then I read along with the stage direction,
so really bad.

173
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.800
I did something there
and then they said:

174
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.560
"You know what,
we'll put you on probation."

175
00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.040
Then I was 7 months
on probation at the school.

176
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:48.160
Did you lock it? - Yes.

177
00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:52.480
You have a proper education.
Have you learned anything else?

178
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.880
I would like to have one more talent,

179
00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.760
like baking cakes
or being a carpenter or something.

180
00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.600
Do you have that too?
Yes, but I don't know what.

181
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.760
Do you sometimes think that you don't
you don't belong here? - Quite often.

182
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.960
I sometimes think, when they realize
that I have no plan at all.

183
00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:14.080
Quite often I don't have a plan,
what I am doing here.

184
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:18.400
Someone asks me a question, I
answer, maybe someone laughs

185
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.280
and I think, crass, has
worked, already 10 years around.

186
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:26.720
If someone asks, "What's the name
your solo program next year",

187
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.600
I think of something.

188
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.120
Then 364 days pass
and then I make a head.

189
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.000
But tell the press
months beforehand to the press,

190
00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:37.520
what great things await us.

191
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.080
This is the great art
of charlatanry.

192
00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.360
Sort of. - Are you also
your ass to the grindstone, too,

193
00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:47.840
when you realize one day
before the premiere,

194
00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.640
you have 2 numbers,
the program should be 2.5 hours.

195
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:56.520
You have to improvise
improvise on stage.

196
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:59.040
One saves oneself
all the time. - Yes.

197
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.440
I'm writing ahead of time.

198
00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.680
For example, I have my club.

199
00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:07.920
I improvise a lot, but
I also leave a lot simply open.

200
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:10.920
My club show
I played partly 3 hours,

201
00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.600
so that in the audience
people got tired

202
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.840
and I asked: Should I stop?

203
00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.320
"Yes, if it goes,
already 2 hours ..."

204
00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.920
Me like this: I'll do two more numbers.
(resigning) "Okay."

205
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.720
They were slightly exhausted by me
and I was like: yeah, uh, hö.

206
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:29.680
Nobody laughed anymore, but I
was like: Hu-uh, horny! I was horny.

207
00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:33.920
But there are also performances,
where the ... There it works.

208
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.880
I don't feel like
to talk to you like this,

209
00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.840
because I am private.
I do not want now ...

210
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.720
What should we do?
Break things?

211
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.040
I have really
private clothes of mine with me.

212
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:52.680
I'll hold this here. - Hold
here, I first have to ...

213
00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.160
It's just that when we're in private.
are private, we are not allowed to smoke.

214
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.640
Oh, that is ...
It is the law that you ...

215
00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.040
I am the only one
who is allowed to smoke in Germany,

216
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:15.000
because I am an artificial figure.

217
00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:19.040
We are always sued
by doctors and entire associations,

218
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.480
who say he must
because he smokes. - Aha.

219
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:25.840
You are undressing right now.
Yes, I am taking off my clothes.

220
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.000
I think that's great.
I'm not up for it.

221
00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:30.680
Nah, that's also ...

222
00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.920
You know, I always wear
sweatpants in private.

223
00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.600
Cool, you offer
your people something.

224
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.000
Whoooo!

225
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.400
(singing) Däm, däm, däm.

226
00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.760
Can you give it a tug?
Yes, wait, give it to me.

227
00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.680
Give me that again. - Shit!

228
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.320
* Audience laughs

229
00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:53.160
Yes ...
Just leave it like that.

230
00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:54.800
* Audience laughs

231
00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.600
Just leave it like this.
Shit, I've got this now ...

232
00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.040
* Mumbles to himself. *

233
00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.440
* Audience laughs

234
00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.880
So, I am now private.

235
00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.520
* Audience laughs

236
00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.520
Come on, I'll give you
I give you too.

237
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.160
* Audience laughs

238
00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.160
I have dentures.

239
00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.240
I wouldn't have thought so.
I am real like that.

240
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.880
* Audience laughs

241
00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.840
Speak to us. Hello?

242
00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.920
Why don't you stop
stop making fun of it.

243
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.480
That is now ...,
in old age, that's how it is.

244
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.760
These are just such tricks.

245
00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:45.320
Here, too, when you ...

246
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.760
Jesus!
I am bald in the back

247
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.520
and let me
that sprayed with paint.

248
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.200
Let's see.

249
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.160
I would not have noticed now.

250
00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.760
So, what else are we talking about now?
About movies. - Movies.

251
00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:09.560
Shall I undo the button?

252
00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.160
You can't,
because it's from the inside.

253
00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.760
If you could
you could open it up.

254
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:16.600
But still stall the sound.

255
00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.960
No, because you are
an actor, actually.

256
00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.080
You are yes, what are you?

257
00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.760
Are you a comedian or an actor?

258
00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.560
Well, I used to say,
I'm an actor.

259
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.040
Because I ...
We did it.

260
00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:38.960
Because I did the training

261
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:42.000
and this title
has given me so much strength.

262
00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.880
It was the first,
thing I completed.

263
00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.280
You're shooting some really cool shit.

264
00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:50.320
I am Johanna.
I am Amilia. - Stella.

265
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:53.280
Myself, Robbie.
We are the clique.

266
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.240
* All speak in parallel. *

267
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.680
Cool, have you
sniff each other out yet?

268
00:14:58.840 --> 00:15:00.440
I did not come up earlier.

269
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.640
And Benni, what do you think of
your school companion?

270
00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:12.480
Don't you want to come in?

271
00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:15.520
When you get sick,
it does not come any faster.

272
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.240
Can we call her again?
Please.

273
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.720
Tell us something about the film,
so that the mic can pick it up.

274
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.840
The movie is just too gross.

275
00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.120
It's such an intense film,

276
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.160
the most violent,
in which I was allowed to play.

277
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.640
Did you have problems
because of your origin

278
00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.520
in Germany,
when you play here?

279
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.920
Some people have a problem
with the fact that I am a Swabian.

280
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.560
* Audience laughs

281
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.400
But the thing is,
I'm over it, yo.

282
00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:55.640
They are such a funny bunch.

283
00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:58.880
(Swabian) I'm above that,
I am Swabian.

284
00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.400
Nah, there were always
a few birds earlier, of course.

285
00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.760
As a kid, right?
Yes, yes. No, it went well.

286
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:08.960
Sure, still,
but as a kid, I think...

287
00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.960
Now the difference is that
I deal with situations differently

288
00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:19.560
and by that,
that people outside recognize me,

289
00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.240
it just doesn't happen that often anymore.
But maybe that's the reason,

290
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.000
that I am no longer
so much in the crowd.

291
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.720
I still have now and then
sayings that are said to me,

292
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.640
even when walking by or something.

293
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.240
Because they think it's funny?
They are serious about it.

294
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:44.200
They seriously want to offend?
Just press 'en spell.

295
00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.400
The difference is,
I go on stage with it.

296
00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.160
It makes me laugh.

297
00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:53.360
When someone is racist to me
and so shows me his abyss,

298
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.560
it makes me laugh now.

299
00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:58.960
That used to hurt me,
Now I'm over it.

300
00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:02.160
I have the chance
to tell this on stage.

301
00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.280
But for many, it just hurts.

302
00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:06.320
It hurt me for a long time, too.

303
00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:10.120
Now I have sometime
understood in my early 20s,

304
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.000
that I have no problem
and the color of the skin is not a problem.

305
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.680
They have a problem.

306
00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:20.280
When I understood that,
I was like: Huh, let's celebrate!

307
00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.960
They have a problem!

308
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:25.880
You have created a character,
the Swabian rage citizen.

309
00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:29.680
You were waiting tables and
the figure was created, what's its name?

310
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.000
(Swabian) Ernst Riedle.
That is so the German Wutbürger.

311
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:39.720
This figure
represents the person who ...

312
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.480
We all have
prejudices to some degree.

313
00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:49.560
But this character is
completely afraid of the stranger

314
00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:52.760
and his reality
is the right reality.

315
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:56.080
In this figure I have
processed many themes.

316
00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.760
It's always the others who are to blame.

317
00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.600
That's just so absurd,
when someone shows you that they're...

318
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:05.760
For me the most absurd thing
on this planet:

319
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.000
We all live on this earth
and when someone

320
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:14.000
because of the color of my skin
or the appearance feels offended,

321
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:19.240
feels attacked or feels
feels exalted and steps down,

322
00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.680
that is for me
the most pathetic thing there is.

323
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:28.080
That is so for me, in my reality
I don't check that in my reality.

324
00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.480
When someone does that,
it makes me laugh.

325
00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:36.600
When someone says to me:
"You dirty canoe, you dirty b...

326
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.680
Ah, fucking Africans.

327
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.800
I personally
deal with it differently,

328
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.520
but understand everyone,
who is hurt by this.

329
00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.560
I have once
imitated an AfD voter

330
00:18:47.720 --> 00:18:51.040
and they laugh and laugh
and then I always think like this,

331
00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.760
not that you take it seriously
or think that I am like that.

332
00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:58.600
Do people forget that with you,
when you do your program,

333
00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.080
that they forget these prejudices?

334
00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:05.880
In your solo program
you do a U-turn at the end,

335
00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.040
where you once again
where you come back to it. - Yes.

336
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:13.760
I had those moments too,
especially with the figure,

337
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.480
because I certainly didn't want
that it would go to the wrong people

338
00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:20.520
is somehow fed to it.

339
00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.800
I was very careful
with this figure,

340
00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.240
because I wanted to point something out,

341
00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.360
but not the prejudices
and support racism.

342
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.520
It was such a fine line.

343
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.560
I have since then
this AfD pox on my ass,

344
00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:38.720
because I expressed myself politically

345
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.800
and at the beginning so noticed,
they think it's good.

346
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.640
Because Kurt Krömer is an angry citizen,
he opens his mouth:

347
00:19:45.800 --> 00:19:48.880
That's enough, I'm not
I won't stand for it, etc.

348
00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.720
I had to become political,
because I wanted to set myself apart

349
00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:55.840
and wanted to say:
Hey, that's a comedy character,

350
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.600
he is angry,
a choleric, yells around.

351
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.640
But that does not mean that you can
instrumentalize me.

352
00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.720
That's why I became,
I don't know, 4 years ago,

353
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:11.520
I cut myself off there, turn them on,
got death threats and I don't know what

354
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.840
and I think it sucks
that I have to do this.

355
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.280
Before that, I never got political,
because I thought, you know,

356
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.360
when I performed with the punks,
when I come from Neukölln,

357
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.080
you need to know
what makes people tick politically.

358
00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.760
What your attitude is.

359
00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.440
I would never associate you
with it,

360
00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.120
but some people
get it wrong.

361
00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.160
That keeps you busy, doesn't it?
I think it's okay, that's nice.

362
00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:41.840
Is the expectation
is that people think,

363
00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.880
uh, could make again
make a gag. - Yes.

364
00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:49.520
I love about you that
you have funny bones, you are funny.

365
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.000
But you are
not put on funny,

366
00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.320
that you do the clown 24 hours.

367
00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.200
One can have a
serious conversation,

368
00:20:57.360 --> 00:21:01.320
without saying that the teddy
is sad, the sad Pierrot.

369
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.800
Nah, I am
anything but sad.

370
00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.200
We laugh too,
not so much now,

371
00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:09.520
because it's exhausting right now.
I think it sucks.

372
00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.920
Nah, I think it's beautiful. Why?
These are real themes and feelings.

373
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.680
Everything else would be
controlled from the outside,

374
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.000
meet the expectation.
Not at all, that's honest.

375
00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.200
Honesty
we need right now, right now.

376
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.080
* Applause *

377
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.880
Well, through Corona
we have only 44 spectators,

378
00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.760
that's why it's a little thin.

379
00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:37.080
Otherwise, there are 4000 out there.

380
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:38.760
4000 in the room?

381
00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:41.760
Yes, they all have
another one on their laps.

382
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.680
You can't hear it either,
because there is bulletproof glass here.

383
00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.560
Just like here.

384
00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:51.600
But you know what's hard for me?
Then we end the topic

385
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.920
and make
another joke. - Yes.

386
00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.640
Do you have a real "oneliner"?
An oneliner. - A fat Otto.

387
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.760
He will tear everyone apart here.

388
00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:05.400
I would like to smoke, but we
are not allowed to, we are private.

389
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:08.440
But you have
surely a masquerade.

390
00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.400
I have this.

391
00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:14.640
* Audience laughs

392
00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.520
I will now explain to you
the German legal system.

393
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:23.720
If I smoke now, I get
a fine that I have to pay.

394
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.480
I may even go
even go to prison.

395
00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.120
When I do like this, I am,

396
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:33.040
stop laughing, a fictional character.
Yes, yes.

397
00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.600
Egon Pimmelmann.

398
00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.520
You are Egon Pimmelmann.

399
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.320
Then I am?

400
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:45.320
I have for you
a mustache with you.

401
00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:49.440
I usually don't smoke at all.

402
00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:55.680
But to break the law,
I'll start smoking once in a while.

403
00:22:56.720 --> 00:22:59.240
Then I am now.
He must stay on!

404
00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.760
If this comes off, you must
not have the cigarette in your mouth.

405
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:06.320
Did not work,
I almost went to jail.

406
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.760
What is the name of your art character,
in which you are right now?

407
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.880
Langbosch.

408
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:17.320
I am not allowed to offer you
offer you a cigarette.

409
00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.200
However, I would like to have one.

410
00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.440
* (clears throat)

411
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:30.560
I didn't offer it to you.
I'm Ronny the trucker.

412
00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.640
Yes, I am now, uh ...

413
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.280
* Audience laughs

414
00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.760
Butts, butts are my life.

415
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.600
* Audience laughs

416
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.640
Without fags I freak out.

417
00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.800
You see, you can create it that way.
I need a dimple nose for that.

418
00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.440
Have the earlier also
always smoked so in my youth.

419
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.440
I'm getting out of the character again.
Me too.

420
00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:12.600
Yeah-ho, what a butt.

421
00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.200
I think we have
already made it, we are through.

422
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.960
Honestly now? - Yes.
That was a nice conversation for once.

423
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.280
What do we say in conclusion,
if it already became so deep?

424
00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:27.040
I don't know.

425
00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.520
Was it deep? Was it too deep?
Honestly, I don't know.

426
00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.840
I put on my shoes,
then we go to the front.

427
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.680
Oh, then I have
there in front still 2 minutes

428
00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:39.360
and can say something, right?
Yes, somehow so.

429
00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:41.800
Come on, Teddy.
We're going out.

430
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:45.160
* Applause *

431
00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.520
So, that's it,
I thank Teddy very much.

432
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.240
Uh, was ...

433
00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:09.040
Worked, was the
the last gag we needed.

434
00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.000
Hey, fucking window, dude.

435
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.520
Then we'll stop with this, yes.

436
00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.480
Cool, so...
Okay, you mice, that's it.

437
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:22.080
Anything else you want to advertise,
or anything? - Yeah, um...

438
00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.520
(speaks slowly)
I would like to get my ...

439
00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:30.400
my ...

440
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.160
* Audience laughs

441
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:41.480
Uh, wait a minute, I'd like
say hello to my, my father,

442
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.640
my mother, my aunt ...

443
00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.560
my great uncle,

444
00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.360
my ...

445
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.000
my one sister,

446
00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:58.840
the half-sister who was excluded from
was excluded from the family.

447
00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.360
I do not laugh because I am happy
I am happy. I laugh because I hate them.

448
00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:07.560
Then I greet my neighbors,

449
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.720
my class 8 b,

450
00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:14.000
the class 4 c, 8 a,

451
00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.280
7 c.

452
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.000
The ...

453
00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.760
8a, b, c, 4.

454
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.200
8 plus 4 is 12.

455
00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.600
Do I take the 12,
round up to 14

456
00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:34.760
and 7 are ...

457
00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.400
* calculates whispering *

458
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.360
... 25.

459
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.440
Yes, there was something for everyone.

460
00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.160
Chez Krömer, we meet again.
Take care, neighbors, bye.

461

* Charles Aznavour:
"For me formidable" *

462
00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:05.360
# You are the one for me, for me

463
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.160
# For me formidable

464
00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:12.320
# You are my love, very, very

465
00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.080
# Very veritable

466
00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:20.400
# Et je voudrais un jour enfin
pouvoir te ... #

467
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.520
But was nice.
Yes, it was quiet.

468
00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:27.280
Are you still recording, you bastards?

469
00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:30.840
Shall we thank
thank the audience again?

470
00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.880
Yes, thanks again to the audience.

471
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.680
* Applause *

472
00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:39.680
* Said is lost in the applause *

473
00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.640
So. - Then I would say,
you just go now.

474
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.800
Do not stress,
go out one by one.

475
00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.440
* Audience laughs

476
00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:00.520
I always cry because I find
find the format so terrible.

477
00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.760
But I invented it myself,
so I can't go around crying.

478
00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:07.640
I'm getting
I'm not having fun anymore,

479
00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800
because you only have assholes there.

480
00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:13.640
I don't even know anymore
how to deal with you,

481
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.520
because you're not an asshole.

482
00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.600
I think I'll do
this next year,

483
00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:21.280
then I have
I'm ready for a good time again.

484
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:25.240
Here is a guest I like,
here's another, and here's another.

485
00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.920
What I always hear now:

486
00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.800
"The Wendler,
you have to invite the Wendler.

487
00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.200
I have no desire
to talk about it in public,

488
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:37.480
but I think he's mentally
sick and we want assholes.

489
00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.000
We want
no sick assholes,

490
00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.960
but we want
people at eye level.

491
00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.160
The Wendler is
already without this psychosis

492
00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.280
like a 12-year-old girl.

493
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:52.720
To strike up there is ...
... antisocial. - ... not courageous.

494
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:58.920
You should just endure the shitstorm
after this show.

495
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:03.480
They're going to kick your ass,
because you were nice - that may be.

496
00:29:03.640 --> 00:29:05.320
I don't care.

497
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.960
Just call me,
I'll be there. - Okay.

498
00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:12.680
Can I sleep with you tonight?

499
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:14.960
* Applause *

500
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.720
Take care.

501

* Applause *

502
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.960
So, go now!
Really, this greed.

503
00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:27.360
We are above time,
coming soon,

504
00:29:27.520 --> 00:29:30.240
RUNS OUT QUICKLY,
"Practice Health.

505
00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.440
So, come on, let's go outside.
