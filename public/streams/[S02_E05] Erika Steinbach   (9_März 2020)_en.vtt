00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.600
* Music *

3
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.680
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

4
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.600
Erika Steinbach:

5
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.160
76 years old, Chairwoman
of the Desiderius Erasmus Foundation,

6
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.200
which was founded by the AfD.

7
00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.200
She criticizes
Angela Merkel's refugee policy,

8
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.000
resigned from the CDU
after 43 years of membership.

9
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.840
I am happy.
* Audience laughs. *

10
00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.920
Good evening.

11
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.960
Ms. Steinbach. Greetings.

12
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.080
I didn't know you could
smoking in the studio. Please?

13
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.040
Neither can you, only me.
Aha.

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.520
* So, Mrs. Steinbach.
Nice single cell here.

15
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.680
What were you invited for now?
Interior show?

16
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.680
Shall we talk about color walls?
No ...

17
00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.800
You fit in well with this ...
Yes? What is this?

18
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.960
Pus? Yes, maybe.

19
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.600
Pus yellow? No, Easter yellow.
That fits, there is a lot of washed out here.

20
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.440
Fits your table.
Yes. Like this.

21
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.240
I ask the questions,
You answer. Yes.

22
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.240
Do we stay like this? Yes, maybe.
What are you actually doing here?

23
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.280
Why did you accept our invitation?
to join us? I am adventurous.

24
00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.360
Or because no other invitations
come anymore?

25
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.960
I don't want to say that.
No? No.

26
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.000
But it has
become rare around your person.

27
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.200
Thank goodness.

28
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.400
I thought you were in the mood for
adventure? I do not understand.

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.080
The questions I ask ... To
Coming to you is an adventure.

30
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.720
Yes.

31
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.920
You were born in 1943 in the so-called Reichsgau
Gdansk-West Prussia.

32
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.280
The father was taken prisoner,
they fled with their sister and mother.

33
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.800
I was escaped.
I was so small then...

34
00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.440
I'll ask the question first,
then you can intervene

35
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.000
and we'll cut that out.
* (LAUGHING)

36
00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.360
They say,
you have as a refugee child

37
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.720
Disregard,
humiliation and bitter hardship.

38
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
What do I have to imagine
imagine? Hunger, all kinds of things.

39
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.200
Three of us in one bed.
Mother, sister and me.

40
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.120
And that until 1952.

41
00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.720
And your father was an occupation soldier?
Drafted, in the air force.

42
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.960
How can you be expelled from something
where you don't belong?

43
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.680
We fled
from the Red Army.

44
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.800
Not me, but
my mother with us children.

45
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.280
Mmm. I don't know,
whether small children escape by themselves.

46
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.040
You fled with them.
I was fled.

47
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.920
Were expelled, where you do not
belong. I was born there.

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.680
On the run?
Before the flight, yes.

49
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.600
Before the escape.
And then you fled. Yes.

50
00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.320
Do you still have that...
Been escaped. Been escaped.

51
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.800
On the subject of refugees, you say,
there will be a catastrophe.

52
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.720
But they are not among the
15 million German expellees ...

53
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.080
Isn't that pure scaremongering?
No.

54
00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.040
After all, we have
12 million refugees.

55
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.680
These were Germans who came to
Germans came, spoke German.

56
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.320
Now it is a different situation.
People are coming from Africa.

57
00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.280
Africa is a continent,

58
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.000
on which the whole of India
and China has space,

59
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.840
the USA, Russia,
the entire European Union.

60
00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.120
There is an infinite amount of space there,
to take in refugees itself.

61
00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.600
There are differences made?
Is the German refugee better?

62
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.880
Every country has
the international obligation,

63
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.200
to include its own citizens.

64
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.480
The Germans came to Germany,

65
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.080
Germany had to
take in its own citizens.

66
00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.080
Own family members
I also record them.

67
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.920
Not if you have
have relatives in Africa.

68
00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.000
If they are own
family members, of course.

69
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.280
Why are you ranting against refugees?
I am not ranting.

70
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.800
Although you yourself have fled
and should know better,

71
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.760
what this is for a ...

72
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.520
I am not ranting at all,
but make it clear,

73
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.840
that we have, for example, the 200 million,
which, according to Prof. Gunnar Heinsohn

74
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.440
on packed suitcases in Africa
and would like to come here,

75
00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.480
impossible to manage.

76
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.800
Neither does the EU.
But you distinguish already.

77
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.880
German suffering
is worth more than Syrian suffering?

78
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.560
No, suffering is suffering.

79
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.600
But every state is obliged
to accept its own citizens.

80
00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.440
Is it not also Islam,
that bothers you?

81
00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.320
Everyone can have the religion
that he thinks is right.

82
00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.920
But he must
abide by our rules.

83
00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.520
That is,
when they come here,

84
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.720
do they have to
learn Christianity at home?

85
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.960
Should the refugee family from
Damascus celebrate Christmas already?

86
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.720
No, but they must not

87
00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.120
with their trained
anti-Semitism.

88
00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.880
That's where I get very persistent.
Who now?

89
00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.520
In the Islamic states

90
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.160
anti-Semitism is inculcated in people
from an early age.

91
00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.920
And they come here ... All of them?
Most of them. It is so.

92
00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.360
You make it sound
it's all of them.

93
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.560
So there are some?
In Islam... Are there some?

94
00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.760
I was told this by someone who is married to a
Moroccan woman ...

95
00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.680
Did you hear?
No, directly original sound.

96
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.080
He has a Moroccan wife ...

97
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.000
One person told you that?
Message.

98
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.560
So he has
anti-Semitic tendencies?

99
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.720
You can observe it in Berlin.

100
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.240
First many,
then some, now one.

101
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.800
What is the name of the man?
I'm about to tell you!

102
00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.320
If someone here with the kippa ...
We are talking about one now.

103
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:06.920
You have experience with a
person who is anti-Semitic.

104
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.400
No, you are not listening to me.
I am listening to you. Nice of you.

105
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.800
We can also rewind here.
I listen to it over and over again.

106
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.920
No, I'm telling you yes.
Yes.

107
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.200
When someone tells me
who is constantly in Morocco,

108
00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.400
there one is particularly friendly
because there was Hitler

109
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.400
and because anti-Semitism is
there in the cradle is put ...

110
00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.280
You are
busy on Twitter.

111
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:38.960
Here's what you posted on 27.
February 2016. Oh God, long time ago.

112
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.360
We have it there.
Wonderful, it fits after all.

113
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.760
That is
an exactly fitting metaphor.

114
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.480
Go to a school
to a school in Frankfurt.

115
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.680
There are German children
with one, two or three

116
00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.720
in the absolute minority.

117
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.800
In all of Frankfurt?
In very many schools.

118
00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.000
In all Frankfurt schools
there are still three Germans?

119
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.080
We are now the minority.
In Frankfurt? Yes, in Frankfurt.

120
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.520
And what do we do now?
The best out of it, quite simply.

121
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.480
That's good. Then you don't have to
not have to criticize it.

122
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:15.400
It is an observation.
Yes, an observation.

123
00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:19.480
Is that also from the one person?
No, I live in Frankfurt.

124
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.720
But you no longer go
to school anymore, do you? No.

125
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.360
But I have enough contact with
parents with school-age children.

126
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.680
For this photo
there was a lot of criticism.

127
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.800
"Germany 2030:
Where Are You Coming From?"

128
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:36.720
Who sent you the photo?

129
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.120
The photo was out on Twitter,
I shared it.

130
00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.680
And what was the title
for this picture? No idea.

131
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.800
2016 ...
You take stuff from the internet

132
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.000
and then interpret
your own stories into it?

133
00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:53.720
That is a wonderful
metaphor for the situation.

134
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.880
Shall I tell you,
what is the origin?

135
00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.480
I know it by now.
Then say it again.

136
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:06.400
That was some Indian family,
who photographed it.

137
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.720
This is their little son.

138
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.920
The Indian family
has the little blond son?

139
00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:18.000
This is quite a friendly picture.
The truth behind this picture is:

140
00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:21.200
An Australian family ...
Yes, an Australian one.

141
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.560
... has been on vacation in India.
I find fantastic.

142
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.880
Well.
And they are all friendly.

143
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.880
Therefore it has
no malicious background at all.

144
00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:33.080
It's a metaphor for
how this can develop,

145
00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.720
what situation we
could get into in Germany.

146
00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.480
That in 2030 all Germans
will be vacationing in India? * Laughter

147
00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.440
No, that is then
no longer a metaphor. Yes.

148
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.440
What does the metaphor stand for? That the
Indians all come to Germany?

149
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.840
Gobshite.
I'll give you that. * (LAUGHING)

150
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.680
What is the metaphor?
I do not understand it.

151
00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:02.000
All Indians are coming now ...
How many do we have? Billions.

152
00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.320
They are all coming
to Germany and look at themselves ...

153
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:08.800
Have you ever been told
that you're a little slow on the uptake?

154
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:13.280
No, not obtuse. Yes, it is.
But what is the problem,

155
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.760
when an Australian family
goes to India?

156
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.440
Don't make yourself out to be dumber
than you are. * (murmuring)

157
00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.960
* (booing)
Explain again.

158
00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.720
How this could develop here in
could develop.

159
00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.200
How. If we
do not stop immigration.

160
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.360
Why do you actually tweet?
It gives me enormous pleasure.

161
00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:38.000
Do you tweet against
your insignificance? No.

162
00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:41.480
To convince others.
Maybe it will work for you.

163
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.920
I am not convinced yet. We
also only have half an hour.

164
00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.160
Then we hang another one on it.

165
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.240
Clear,
a theme evening Erika Steinbach.

166
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.280
People will be happy.
* Laughter *

167
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.800
Would you like to apologize to the
apologize? No, why?

168
00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.760
They stole the photo. The
have put it on the net themselves.

169
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:03.440
Then you do what you want?

170
00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:06.560
Can I also take a picture
take a picture? You may.

171
00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.200
"This is what this looks like in 2030."
Yes ... * (LAUGHING)

172
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.840
You are welcome to do so. Yes?
I'm already putting up a fight.

173
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.280
"250 Erika Steinbachs come
and then look at us silly."

174
00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:22.760
What else do you have in store?
I am confused right now.

175
00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.360
I drink water to your health.
Yes.

176
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.360
This Filly cup
fits well with the jacket.

177
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:32.320
This cute pink foal.

178
00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:35.640
We're not getting anywhere.
You can see that for yourself, can't you?

179
00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:37.520
That's a good thing.

180
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:42.520
Is that your thing: going somewhere
and not getting anywhere?

181
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.760
Isn't that sad,
that you only made things,

182
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.880
where you can't get anywhere,
have not convinced anyone?

183
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:54.400
After all, there is now the Foundation
Flight, Expulsion, Reconciliation.

184
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.960
Without me, there would be no
in Berlin without me.

185
00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:01.840
There the fate of the
German Heimatvertriebene is presented.

186
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.760
You were chairman then?
14 years.

187
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.520
Have you learned nothing there?
More than you would like.

188
00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.120
It doesn't add up: this
statement now, chairman ...

189
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.320
It all fits together.
Yes? In your world.

190
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.080
No, not in my world.
In the world of human rights.

191
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.760
From you and your friend,
who whispers things to you?

192
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
* (LAUGHING)
Not the friend.

193
00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.760
You do not have a boyfriend?

194
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.640
Do you actually still have friends?
Lots of them. Yes? Good.

195
00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.440
But on the subject of refugees
you can't smile properly.

196
00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:40.560
No, because a
devastating policy is being pursued.

197
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.840
This woman sees it quite differently.

198
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.720
If we start having to apologize
have to apologize for it,

199
00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:51.560
that in emergency situations
show a friendly face,

200
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:54.480
then this is not my country.

201
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.320
That is why the CDU
is in such a disastrous position today.

202
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:04.400
Because of this sentence? Because of this
One of the reasons.

203
00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:06.600
What's wrong with that sentence?

204
00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.320
The misery of this world will not
be healed in Germany.

205
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.800
This is known to every person who
can put one and one together.

206
00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.800
That is the be-all and end-all.
You have to be able to calculate. Mhm.

207
00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.200
You are the seer and
everyone else around you is stupid?

208
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:27.280
You only need to calculate
and add up the numbers. Yes, mmm.

209
00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:33.600
6 weeks earlier Angela Merkel had
explained to a refugee child,

210
00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.960
that it has to be deported.
We look at the MAZ.

211
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.800
It is really very unpleasant,

212
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.280
to watch how others
can enjoy life

213
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:49.960
and you yourself
can not enjoy it with.

214
00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.080
I understand that.
Politics is hard sometimes,

215
00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.280
but some have to go back.

216
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.360
I think that within
a year all the cases ...

217
00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:04.000
Oh God ...

218
00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.600
You did a great job, didn't you?

219
00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:16.960
What would you have done in that case?
Consoled the child or hit him?

220
00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.760
* Laughter *

221
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.240
Weeping children are comforted.

222
00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.800
Children are not to be
in principle.

223
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:26.760
I get angry
when someone hits his child.

224
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:31.720
But what would you have done in that case?
done? Consoled the tears as well.

225
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.320
This does not change
our legal position.

226
00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:37.920
Those who do not have asylum
must return to their homeland.

227
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.840
Some say,
this encounter is a reason

228
00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.240
for Merkel's welcome culture
"We can do it.

229
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.920
Do you think so too?
I can't judge.

230
00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:52.520
I appreciate Angela Merkel
as a person,

231
00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:57.000
but as a politician I no longer understand
her as a politician for a long time.

232
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.480
Well? And now?

233
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:09.160
Now you are speechless.

234
00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.520
Huh?

235
00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:13.240
* irritated laughter *

236
00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.000
Can't you think of anything else?

237
00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.920
He takes flight.

238
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.200
Bang.

239
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:32.440
I need a break for a minute,
you know? * (LAUGHING)

240
00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:44.600
It goes round in circles,
you don't get anywhere.

241
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.520
I sometimes ask myself
what I am doing here.

242
00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.960
What is it now?

243
00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:59.440
Am I journalistic ...

244
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.840
political,
investigative journalist,

245
00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.840
who pops out anything here?

246
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.920
The sentences always come.
It's always the same.

247
00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.120
You've been hearing that for 30 years and
and you'll still be hearing it 20 years from now.

248
00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:31.280
Did you catch yourself?
No, I was just having a smoke.

249
00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.960
You know, Mrs. Steinbach,

250
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:37.160
in the room is a pink elephant,
close enough to touch.

251
00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:41.080
Which pink elephant?
He's practically sitting on my lap.

252
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:44.120
He gives me shortness of breath.
Oh God, you poor thing.

253
00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:49.360
You are 43 years ... Shall I explain to you
explain how this affects me?

254
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.040
No, I am 76 years old.

255
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.600
You are 76 years old.
You were a member of the CDU for 43 years.

256
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.520
Nothing happened there. What?
You didn't make a career there.

257
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:03.840
No one asked you ...
Yes, the chancellor offered me ...

258
00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.160
At some point, you become bitter.

259
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.640
Then you look: "How can I hit the table again now?
bang on the table again?

260
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.360
I pick out refugees,
rant against foreigners.

261
00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:19.440
A few lost sheep
will clap to me."

262
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.480
So, Mr. Krömer ...
You are really bitter. No.

263
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:28.480
* Applause * The chancellor offered me
to become Secretary of State.

264
00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:32.520
I refused.
You are stuck in the 70s,

265
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:37.880
with an image that no longer
fits into today's time.

266
00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.520
You think so?

267
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.680
You know, my husband was ... I
am someone who feels empathy.

268
00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.560
So do I.
I feel sorry for you.

269
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:51.520
What you say in public
on television disgusts me,

270
00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.360
pisses me off, it disgusts me.
Why did you invite me?

271
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:59.240
I don't know if you know
know the concept of this program.

272
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.960
I invite people
that I don't understand. Yes.

273
00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.560
We invite ourselves
Assholes and friends

274
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.560
and I do not say
who is who.

275
00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:10.280
* I know who you mean.
Do you think I'm stupid?

276
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:12.480
You are not stupid,
on the contrary.

277
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:15.720
You are
a very intelligent woman. Thank you.

278
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.200
I do not understand you
and it disgusts me,

279
00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:22.640
on the other hand you are a tragic
figure. I feel sorry for you.

280
00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960
I am really well.

281
00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:29.040
You were with the CDU for 43 years
and are now clapping all over the place,

282
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.120
where someone says something about the AfD.

283
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.920
Why don't you still join
join the AfD and try,

284
00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.640
to make a career there?

285
00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.680
Leave it to me,
whether I want to remain non-partisan.

286
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.400
But I vote for the AfD.
Not fish and not meat.

287
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.600
Make up your mind.
You'll have to leave that up to me.

288
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.280
You are not my guardian.

289
00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.280
When you go out, you are free.
You can also go now.

290
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.000
I already practice
here in this cell.

291
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.040
Who knows how long
still have freedom of expression,

292
00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:01.640
without being locked up.
* boos

293
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.680
Are you sprinkling a one-liner now?

294
00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.800
No. Do we still want to put on
Fun hats on? No.

295
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:10.200
We can also play sack race.

296
00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.160
Why don't you let me talk?
as I like.

297
00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.960
Yes, go ahead.

298
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:17.880
But don't always tell
the same shit.

299
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:21.200
I tell the same thing?
You always ask the same thing.

300
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.800
Why don't you ask something else?
What should I ask you?

301
00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.360
If you have nothing left in stock
have ... We still have enough.

302
00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.800
But it's pissing me off right now.

303
00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:34.040
There is a great danger
that I throw up over the table.

304
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.840
In the orchestra
we were eight to twelve nations.

305
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.160
Yes, the old song of the taiga.
Not the old song of the taiga.

306
00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:43.840
That works,
if you live in unison.

307
00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.920
Then it works.
We now come to Thuringia.

308
00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:49.760
What for? Thuringia.

309
00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.800
Oh, that's wonderful.

310
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.600
The AfD broke a taboo in Thuringia on February 5.
February 5 in Thuringia.

311
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.440
The FDP politician Thomas Kemmerich

312
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.480
became with votes of the AfD
Prime Minister.

313
00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.120
We'll take a look,
It's been a long time.

314
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:06.120
* Laughter *

315
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.360
Was that in your world
a beautiful day?

316
00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:19.720
A beautiful day
in the life of Erika Steinbach?

317
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.920
Have you opened a Rotkäppchen sparkling wine
from 1938? * (LAUGHING)

318
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:27.560
I do not drink Rotkäppchen sparkling wine.

319
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.880
What did you say to that?

320
00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:35.440
I thought it was fantastic
that the leftist, the communist,

321
00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:38.240
was not elected prime minister
was elected.

322
00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:41.800
However, there were already
two votes from the CDU.

323
00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:45.960
The others chose rather
the liberal, CDU, FDP ...

324
00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:50.320
CDU and FDP voters did not even know before the
election that this would happen.

325
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.680
Well, the members of the state parliament
vote secretly.

326
00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.720
Do you not know our parliamentarism
not? That is the law.

327
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:02.120
Secret ... They sing. * (LAUGHING)
Maybe that will convince you more.

328
00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.840
And what is ... Yes, good.

329
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.640
Several politicians drew parallels
to elections from 90 years ago.

330
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.280
In secret elections?

331
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.040
I draw the parallel at that,
what Angela Merkel said in response:

332
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.000
that would have to be reversed.

333
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.840
That is dictatorial,
not parliamentary.

334
00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.920
They also say,
that Höcke is not extreme right-wing.

335
00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.440
I don't know him personally.
What makes you think that?

336
00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.920
I know the party program of the ...
I don't know it either.

337
00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.600
I know
the party program of the AfD,

338
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:39.960
that is almost 90%,

339
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.680
what the CDU used to do,
but no longer implements today.

340
00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.280
They are of the opinion ...
They prefer to vote for the communist,

341
00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.680
of which six organizations ...
Who is the communist?

342
00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.120
Ramelow is a communist after all.

343
00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:59.280
He does not even say,
that the GDR was an unjust state.

344
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.360
In case you forgot.

345
00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.080
But Höcke
is in your eyes no ...

346
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.960
As long as he stands on the ground
of the AfD party program.

347
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:12.400
This is a democratic program.

348
00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.800
Read it sometime,
maybe it will help.

349
00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:17.760
The Thuringia court ruling,

350
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:21.800
that you can call him a fascist
fascist is wrong?

351
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:26.360
If you call me a fascist today,
that is also your freedom of speech.

352
00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:30.560
But if you can say from the court
that is a fascist?

353
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.760
In court and on the high seas
you are always in God's hands.

354
00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:36.240
The verdict
was pronounced on the high seas?

355
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.000
For this, Seehofer
his AfD post banned.

356
00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:41.960
In your eyes
Höcke is not a fascist?

357
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.840
Not for me.
Not for you.

358
00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.360
Why should he be a fascist?
Because there was a verdict.

359
00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.760
From a judge.
Was he also a communist?

360
00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:58.320
Or was there no judge free
and the gatekeeper pronounced the verdict?

361
00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.720
Take a look at the program.

362
00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:06.760
The program states,
that Höcke is not a fascist?

363
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.600
May I finish? The judge
had a bad day? No.

364
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:16.000
The AfD has admitted that the election was not
that the election was not kosher.

365
00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.800
Why? They saw they couldn't get their
their own candidate.

366
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:23.240
"Then we elect
the one from the Free Democrats,

367
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:28.080
so that Ramelow is not elected."
I find that very democratic.

368
00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.480
A public rip-off.

369
00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.120
After all, that was the point of the strategy.

370
00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.840
We have tried

371
00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.480
Mr. Kemmerich to the podium as an opposing candidate
to the podium.

372
00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:43.080
He did that, too, and then
we elected him according to plan.

373
00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.480
That's a good thing.
That's a good thing.

374
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.800
What don't you understand about it,
that a 5% man is not ...

375
00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.520
If the majority elects him,
he is elected.

376
00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:55.960
5% is now the majority?
You said you can do the math.

377
00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.200
* The Mr. Ramelow
did not have a majority either.

378
00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.000
But it's still 5%.
That is not the majority.

379
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:08.120
The deputies were the majority.
May I say Pippi Longstocking?

380
00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.280
No. You arrange everything
the way you want it.

381
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.560
I can count.
Yes, but apparently not over 5%.

382
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.800
45 voted for the.
45 votes.

383
00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:23.280
And 44 for Mr. Ramelow.
So he is elected with 45 votes.

384
00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:27.400
This was decided by freely elected
so decided.

385
00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.000
Uh... Yes.
* scattered applause *

386
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.680
It's raining outside.
* Laughter *

387
00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:38.280
It splashes against the windows.

388
00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:41.880
Let's take a look:
The AfD and the classic family.

389
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.960
You voted for the AfD in 2017.

390
00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:48.320
Party card you have
but not yet? No.

391
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:53.320
Like the AfD, you have
the guiding principle "classical family

392
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.000
and are also against gay marriage.

393
00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.640
Against this kind of gay marriage
I have voted.

394
00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.200
What kind of gay marriage? Everyone
should live together as he wants.

395
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.880
But the state should financially
what is useful for the future.

396
00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:12.000
Gay marriages can do little to help.

397
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:13.960
Can't they adopt?

398
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.120
A child should first be
be adopted there,

399
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.200
where it has father and mother.

400
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:23.160
They say it's not bad
when children have a father and mother.

401
00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:27.040
Now I'm going to fall asleep.
* (LAUGHING)

402
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.400
You don't need a sleeping pill.

403
00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:33.120
You are not from this world,
Mrs. Steinbach.

404
00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.720
Why?
When I take off your jacket,

405
00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:40.520
you have there a battery chain
and run on Duracell?

406
00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.840
Everyone can live as they wish.

407
00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.800
But not homosexual.
Also homosexual.

408
00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.680
Let's take a look at
the top personnel of the AfD.

409
00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:53.600
Party leader Jörg Meuthen
is twice divorced,

410
00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.200
got married for the third time.

411
00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.040
Alexander Gauland is married,
but lives separately.

412
00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.080
Alice Weidel is a lesbian and lives
with a wife and children. So diverse.

413
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.240
So ...
There is nothing you can say.

414
00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.400
Can I just summarize that?

415
00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:14.600
They are against homosexuals,
but lesbians are allowed.

416
00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:16.440
No, sorry.

417
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.760
Can we write it down like this?
Against homosexual marriages.

418
00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:22.040
You should not shorten.

419
00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:24.760
I hold Dr. Weidel in very high regard.

420
00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:30.360
She convinced me to become
I become chairwoman of the foundation.

421
00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:34.080
With lesbian help, so to speak.
Yes, if you like.

422
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.240
But you will never finance
finance anything? Excuse me?

423
00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:41.840
What was that about financing?
(groans) I have ...

424
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.280
Am I getting to you?
The top personnel of the AfD.

425
00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:48.920
Find,
Mrs. Weidel and her partner

426
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:51.200
should not raise children?

427
00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:55.840
That is the business of Ms. Weidel
and her partner, not mine.

428
00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:59.200
They tweeted on gay marriage
June 19, 2017:

429
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.800
* Krömer reads aloud. *

430
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.480
What was going on?

431
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:11.600
When children for adoption
into same sex

432
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.360
Men's groups
be given ...

433
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:17.680
I have long
with pedophilia.

434
00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:21.600
In the meantime also
some things have come up in Berlin,

435
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.680
which confirms that.

436
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.200
Against the background
you have to be wide awake.

437
00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.840
The topic is
more widespread in this society,

438
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.120
than you can imagine.

439
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:38.160
That every homosexual ... No,
don't put anything in my mouth.

440
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.200
The issue is very common.
It definitely exists.

441
00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:49.320
That there are persons who exploit adoption
exploit in such cases,

442
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.080
I am firmly convinced of that.
All of them? No.

443
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.160
Don't put anything in my mouth.

444
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:57.880
And that is why no
homosexual couple adopt?

445
00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.720
The adoption law
was actually clear.

446
00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.360
Z. For example, only
married couples were allowed to adopt children,

447
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:08.920
who theoretically
would still be able to,

448
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:11.840
own children
to bring into the world, to beget.

449
00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:17.440
When you were over 40 or 50,
you could no longer adopt.

450
00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.080
That was resolved.

451
00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:22.560
When Gerhard Schröder
adopted the Russian child,

452
00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.880
According to the law, it should have been ...
Is he a homosexual?

453
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.600
No, this has nothing to do with homosexuality
nothing at all to do with homosexuality.

454
00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:33.640
The comparison with pedophilia ...
Is that what you told Alice Weidel?

455
00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:37.840
Do not always
Don't always mix things up.

456
00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.800
But she adopted.
Tell her too.

457
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.640
Maybe there is also
something is wrong. Yes, but ...

458
00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.080
Just because you know them ...
That's where you come off.

459
00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.840
No, I'm more with the men,
when it comes to abuse.

460
00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:55.560
Not for women?
More likely with men. Okay.

461
00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:00.200
But isn't lesbian also
a bit homosexual?

462
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.560
But you can pick and choose,
as it just fits.

463
00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.600
No, this is
not just a matter of experience,

464
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.320
but largely confirmed.

465
00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:14.480
Mrs. Steinbach ... That was it.

466
00:28:15.160 --> 00:28:17.040
You have done very well.

467
00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.400
We must now
unfortunately deport you. Yes, absolutely.

468
00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.480
* (LAUGHING)
I am dismissed.

469
00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:26.560
* Come on out
outside for a moment, please.

470
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.760
Hello, good evening.

471
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.720
* restrained applause *

472
00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.480
Take a seat there.

473
00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:43.400
Can we take a selfie for my grandpa
take a selfie for my grandpa?

474
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:45.600
He was in the Wehrmacht.

475
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.200
* (LAUGHING)
I thought for your great-grandfather.

476
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.440
Good.

477
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.520
Sometimes there are days
when one is happy,

478
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:57.560
that after the day comes the next.

479
00:28:57.720 --> 00:29:00.800
And that one is rid of the guest.
That in any case.

480
00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.600
That's what I thought.
What was that? * (LAUGHING)

481
00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:07.040
Excuse me,
are you that sensitive?

482
00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:10.720
I did not understand a lot of things,
Mrs. Steinbach. Neither did I.

483
00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:15.240
I have all the time
thinking through the concept of the show.

484
00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:19.840
You will not invite me again
again. Absolutely not.

485
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.680
I thought so.
* Applause *

486
00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.440
Erika Steinbach.
Take care, neighbors.

487
00:29:28.440 --> 00:29:30.280
* Music *

488
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:42.520
You will not send this,
knowing you. Please?

489

You're not going to broadcast this.
Yes, of course I am.
