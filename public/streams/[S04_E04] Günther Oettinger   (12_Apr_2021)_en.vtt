00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.160
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.600
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.680
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.640
Ah!

6
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.320
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.240
* (SIGHS)

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.160
A bundle of banknotes. Oettinger!
I want to solve: Oettinger.

9
00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.280
Mr. Oettinger?

10
00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.840
Good evening.
I knew it!

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800
Wuss... Günther Oettinger?
Günther Oettinger from Stuttgart.

12
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.040
Wonderful. Mr. Oettinger,
first of all, thank you.

13
00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.560
You are so busy ...
Thank you for your time.

14
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.560
Agreed deadlines
are kept. - Works for us.

15
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.840
Mine too.

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.640
Do you hear me
if I don't press here?

17
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.080
Apparently not.
* Cough *

18
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.720
So.

19
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.200
* Good evening.
Good evening, Mr. Oettinger.

20
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.480
You are beverage-technically
supplied? - I have water.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.280
But something with carbonic acid
would be even nicer. - I do not know.

22
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.360
We need to ...
Never mind. It's okay.

23
00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.120
Do you have everything? - Yes.
After all, it's all about me now.

24
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.520
I'm here, aren't I?
Of course.

25
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.400
Have you not shaved?
You haven't either, have you?

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.920
With me, yes ... - No,
I had a home office for the week.

27
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.120
I'm allowed to do that, I'm a teenager.
I'm also out of ...

28
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.200
What do you have, home office?
Home office, sure.

29
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.240
Mr. Oettinger, shall we
start right away? - Decide.

30
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.000
Actually you are
a colleague of mine, huh?

31
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.040
In what way?
In terms of comedy and clowning.

32
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.200
They are actually really funny.
Funny guy.

33
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.200
Yes, I think so.
Ulknudel. - Also, yes.

34
00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.880
(laughs) Stupid bard. - Also.
Ha!

35
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.800
Let's take a look at
the first fat Otto.

36
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.160
A stand-up from you, so to speak.
VTR off.

37
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.000
(strong German accent)
We have to find a way ...

38
00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.800
(comments) That was obvious.

39
00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.760
... limiting
the governmental interferance

40
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.920
into economic activities,

41
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.520
since the world ...
since it would otherwise

42
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.960
cause a pernament impairment
of the gross drivers

43
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.040
for free market economy.

44
00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.800
Thank you for the MAZ. I see,
we can speak German.

45
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.960
Why did you go to Brussels if
you speak English so badly?

46
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.480
I had nine years of high school,

47
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.520
nine years of which were spent in Latin,
that's what my father wanted.

48
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.520
Seven years of French
and three years of English.

49
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.840
If you had spoken in Latin,
would everyone have taken off their hats?

50
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.560
Then I would have
linguistically read off cleanly.

51
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.840
I have not needed English
my entire professional life. - I see.

52
00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.360
But Latin, or what?
Latin is of little use in Brussels.

53
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.320
That's what I mean.
English is the language there.

54
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.680
Yes, English, French, German.

55
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.440
We Germans believe that we
have to speak perfect English.

56
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.360
Sure, if you've spent your whole life
focused on Latin your whole life,

57
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.480
English is dropped.
School life.

58
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.600
I studied Turkish in school
with Turkish

59
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.400
and could not speak English either.

60
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.400
If you come from Kreuzberg, sure.
But perfect, Neukölln.

61
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.320
Neukölln. - Mhm.

62
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.240
A hip urban district by now,
isn't it?

63
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.080
We have
164 nations in Neukölln.

64
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.200
Swabians, too.
Yes? - Mhm.

65
00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.120
Is that so?
Do we have Swabians in Berlin?

66
00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.600
Yes, after the Berliners
the Turks are the strongest group,

67
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.240
then the Swabians.

68
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.520
I see, as a Berliner
not noticed yet.

69
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.880
So, Mr. Thing.

70
00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.640
You were several times
on the "heute" show. - Yes, gladly.

71
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.120
Can you laugh at yourself?
I think so, yes. - Yes?

72
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.280
Yes, I have irony ability.
You do, do you?

73
00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.040
Notice,
that you can be funny

74
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:04.880
or is that
an involuntary joke?

75
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.160
Mostly voluntarily,
now and then involuntarily. - Mostly.

76
00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.320
Mostly involuntary.
Mostly voluntary. - I see.

77
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.680
Good. In 2019, you left Brussels
as an EU Commissioner.

78
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.440
You are now 67. Isn't it
time for retirement?

79
00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.280
I have always
advocated retirement at 70.

80
00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.360
And as long as I am healthy,
toi, toi, toi

81
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.960
and I enjoy my work,
I have no plans to do so,

82
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.960
to lie on the beach in Mallorca,
but to work.

83
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.440
So you'll stop at 70?
We will see.

84
00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.280
Closing time then?
No.

85
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.920
I come from a liberal profession
as a lawyer and business manager.

86
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.440
My dad worked
until he was 80 years old.

87
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.880
The nice thing is, you can get out as a
civil servant out in one fell swoop, the end.

88
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.040
As a freelancer you can
only work four days at 73,

89
00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.040
take six weeks vacation ...

90
00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.080
Okay, that had all been answered
the second to last sentence.

91
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.720
Thank you, Mr. Oettinger.

92
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.680
The EU would like to see
pause for at least two years.

93
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:08.560
No, that's not true.
Let me first ...

94
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.480
This is a more complex thing,
not short, snappy questions.

95
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.840
There is a structure to it, a method.

96
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.040
After all, I'm a star journalist.
Have you prepared yourself?

97
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.120
I think so.
I'll start again.

98
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.560
The EU would like to see
pause for at least two years,

99
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.760
before it
going into the free economy,

100
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.400
so that no conflicts of interest
arise.

101
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.600
You don't see it so narrowly.
Am I right? - No.

102
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.120
There is a "code of conduct".
A what? - Code of conduct.

103
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.040
Was that English or Latin?
That was English.

104
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.560
I have read that,
You and Küppersbusch probably haven't.

105
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.360
Who? - Küppersbusch.

106
00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.200
Who is Mr. Küppersbusch?
Your ghostwriter.

107
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.240
Ghostwriter? You have
English terms,

108
00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.680
I was not prepared for that.

109
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.560
We have a cooling-off period.

110
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:00.320
One is allowed to work full time,
but must register it in Brussels

111
00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.960
and there must
not be a conflict of interest.

112
00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.400
Yes, that's what I read out.
That is not so desirable.

113
00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.520
You have inquired about a professional ban.

114
00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.400
We have also found a critic
found. - Only one?

115
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.920
It is the Green
MEP ... - Yes, friend.

116
00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.520
Please?
An important man, new at this.

117
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.000
Is this really a friend
of yours? - No, it's called a friend.

118
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.720
Do you know him?
Only from the media.

119
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.800
He is not that important to me.
No?

120
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:31.480
But he has a point of criticism
point of criticism. MAZ, please.

121
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.720
14 new employers

122
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.640
he has notified
to the European Commission,

123
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.200
Banks, consultants, auditors.

124
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.640
Seven of them alone are registered in Brussels
registered as lobbyists.

125
00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.200
He's not allowed to lobby,
but he says he does consulting.

126
00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.120
So far
not a single commissioner has done.

127
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.120
That is,
when a company makes decisions,

128
00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:58.000
wants to influence laws of the EU,

129
00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:02.200
then in the future they can
rent a former commissioner

130
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.440
and its Europe-wide network
simply comes with it.

131
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.920
A Quassler without end.

132
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.280
Of the 14 tasks, not jobs,
seven alone are purely honorary positions.

133
00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.760
Z. E. g. in the advisory board of the Museum
for regional history in Württemberg.

134
00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.040
Z. E. g. at the German
Society for Foreign Policy.

135
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:24.240
And the other six?
These are professional activities.

136
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.560
As a lawyer, as
Managing Director of a Consulting,

137
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:30.760
as a member of two supervisory boards
and two advisory boards.

138
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.960
What did friend tell there? Did he
out of his nose?

139
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.560
Everything was registered by me,

140
00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.960
reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee
and approved.

141
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:45.640
I have shown everything,
that's why his claim,

142
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.920
I would be breaking the law,
Bullshit. - Mhm.

143
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.960
But that is your opinion now.
No, it is a fact.

144
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.880
My opinion is not.
You are biased.

145
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.360
We just keep going.
The first 2 years after tenure

146
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.600
you are
entitled to a transitional allowance,

147
00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:02.680
If you don't take jobs.

148
00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.960
You do without
on this 11,000 euros per month?

149
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.520
I have
opted for the lower pension

150
00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.440
and not for transitional payments.

151
00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:13.080
You won't take the 11,000 euros?
No.

152
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.280
How much? - You can
read up, it would be 7,000 euros.

153
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.200
I see, 7,000 or 11,000 euros ...
To have or not to have.

154
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:24.520
Your director gets that much, too.
What? - Your director.

155
00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:27.040
Intendant even.
Yes, depending.

156
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.160
You are not well prepared,
can that be?

157
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.160
There are male artistic directors ...

158
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.400
We have a female
director. - Active? - Active.

159
00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.520
And retiring male directors.

160
00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.800
It may also be
that there are male artistic directors,

161
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.520
who wear a skirt, that would be
then female artistic directors?

162
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.160
It's about the pension.

163
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.360
How?
Husband and wife get a pension.

164
00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.720
Why shouldn't a commissioner ...
We get bogged down.

165
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:57.280
Why doesn't a commissioner get
what a senator gets?

166
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.840
As a woman or as a man?
Doesn't matter. - Okay.

167
00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.040
On the advisory board of Deloitte,
an auditing

168
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.520
and consulting firm,
you were given conditions,

169
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:09.600
may not work as a lobbyist
and not advise on lobbying matters.

170
00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:11.960
Do you get
short-time allowance?

171
00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.600
I am an advisory board member there,

172
00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.520
we meet 4 times a year 3 hours,
12 hours a year.

173
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.360
12 hours a year?
Yes, an advisory board.

174
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.400
Not one ... - Your work
as a lobbyist is, 12 ... How much?

175
00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.720
I am
Advisory Board member at Deloitte.

176
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:29.720
We have four meetings a year
in Munich, which I attend.

177
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.920
And short-time allowance? - No.

178
00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:39.400
Full money?
Not at all. Advisory board meeting fees.

179
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.040
End, off.
Oh, you don't get anything there either?

180
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:46.040
Do you get by at all?
make ends meet? - Don't worry.

181
00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.320
You have the nickname
"Commissioner of the Corporations".

182
00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.120
I don't think so.
Yes, I do, here at "LobbyControl".

183
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:57.840
Friend again. - You have not
not well prepared.

184
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.520
I have no intention of making LobbyControl
to be my main organ.

185
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:06.080
Regarding the term "commissioner of the corporations
we have a VTR. - Gladly.

186
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:09.440
From a ...
Oh, the boyfriend again. - Sure.

187
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.800
Daniel Friend.
Your friend, not mine.

188
00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:14.320
Neither does my friend.
Apparently he does.

189
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.480
Above all, he was the lobby commissioner.

190
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.400
806 meetings with lobbyists
he had.

191
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.440
That's a lonely record,
no other commissioner

192
00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.560
ever had as many meetings
with lobbyists as Oettinger.

193
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.720
He has about 90% of his meetings

194
00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.840
with companies
and business associations

195
00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.320
and only 10 %
with consumer advocates, NGOs,

196
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.160
with universities.

197
00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:42.400
(laughs) 806 meetings? Chapeau.
Ten years from now.

198
00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:46.400
But still.
That's 2,000 working days.

199
00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.480
When a managing director
of a company,

200
00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.480
an association president
or IHK managing director

201
00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:54.960
wants to talk to me,
I receive the.

202
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.080
806 meetings?
In ten years!

203
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.040
Let's face it:
Was there still time for real politics?

204
00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.120
Of course.
After all, you weren't watching me.

205
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:08.160
In Brussels, everyone says:
"Oettinger was busy

206
00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.360
and present in the Parliament, in the Council
in the Commission, with associations,

207
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.400
meetings, conferences
and also a lot in Germany."

208
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:19.440
The only one who does not agree
is apparently Daniel Freund.

209
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.880
What a thing.
All agree,

210
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:28.280
only this one person
can tear everything down.

211
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.160
* Cough * The EU transparency rules
prescribe,

212
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:35.120
that all meetings
are reported within 2 weeks.

213
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.280
That's where the Greens got you:

214
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.320
In 2016 you did not publish your meetings
not published for months.

215
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.200
Did you have to gloss over anything?
We published everything.

216
00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.720
They say yes, they say no.
What should I believe?

217
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.400
We had to for each week,
for my person, for my cabinet

218
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.680
indicate our meetings with third parties.

219
00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:59.520
That's what we did. - Why do
they say no? - I don't know.

220
00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.000
I don't care either.
A plot?

221
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:04.280
I don't know.
A witch hunt.

222
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.800
Do you mean,
the Greens meet in Brussels

223
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.520
and think about
ugliness against you?

224
00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.960
I have many friends in the
many friends. - Yes, friend.

225
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.360
Friends. - I see.
Kretschmann ...

226
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.400
Bütikofer,
Rezzo Schlauch and many others.

227
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:21.880
Friend I do not know at all.
Is your friend.

228
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.240
You said you knew him.
I know him from here.

229
00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:29.800
No, before the first VTR ran,
you said you knew him.

230
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:33.640
From what he says.
Do not get into a lurch.

231
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.600
I have never met him,
only read about him,

232
00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.600
because he expresses himself every day.

233
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.000
He seems to express himself a lot.

234
00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:44.560
According to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung
you met in 2015

235
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.000
with "Wirecard" CFO
Burkhard Ley.

236
00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.720
Punishable? No.
No. - So.

237
00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.000
You can guess three times
who has something to say about this.

238
00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:57.360
Daniel Freund. - Right.

239
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:03.520
It is precarious that Oettinger did not publish this
meeting has not been made public,

240
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:05.760
against the rules of the EU Commission,

241
00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.760
where meetings with lobbyists
must be disclosed.

242
00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.760
He says,
he did not disclose that,

243
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.520
because there was also someone
with a CDU party book was there.

244
00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.800
And internal party meetings
do not have to be disclosed.

245
00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:24.720
But if
a member of the Management Board of Wirecard is present,

246
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.840
who writes an e-mail what a great
what a great lobby meeting it was ...

247
00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.680
He used an excuse.

248
00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.480
Clever.
No, that was not a party friend.

249
00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.960
That was a former MP,
who is a CDU man,

250
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.560
but me as the Holstein MP
has visited: Peter Harry Carstensen.

251
00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:44.080
He came to see you at the meeting?
Yeah, sure.

252
00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:48.080
By 2019, everyone was proud,
when they were allowed to meet Wirecard.

253
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.320
That was in 2015,
since then never again.

254
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:52.160
Where are we actually going?

255
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:56.040
No, where are we going?
Wirecard is a mess.

256
00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.040
Yes, that's right.
We know that today.

257
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.280
In 2015 it was
a rising Company,

258
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.080
the hope
in the digital finance industry.

259
00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.360
I met them once.

260
00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.640
Did you know before,
that this is a great company?

261
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.200
I didn't know him at all,
Carstensen introduced him to me.

262
00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:16.440
You did not know
what kind of company this is? - No.

263
00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:21.440
I knew Carstensen,
he wanted to meet me. - Mhm.

264
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.560
Yes. - He said, "Let's meet."
And you: "Sure."

265
00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:27.960
I see him more often.
Suddenly there were three of you.

266
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:31.640
There was also someone from my cabinet
There were four or five of us.

267
00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.720
Nothing suspicious, nothing at all.
Mhm. I have one more question.

268
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.360
Please only
answer with yes or no.

269
00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.680
Does Daniel Freund have something against you?

270
00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.120
Yes.

271
00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.640
What drives you,
Mr. Oettinger?

272
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:50.880
You mean politically?
Everything, in general.

273
00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.840
I come
from a political family,

274
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.960
my dad was a liberal,
we had discussions early on.

275
00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.480
I was very left-liberal.
Perhaps a little shorter.

276
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.760
I was very interested
and always wanted to participate.

277
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.760
Participation is the main thing.
Class Representative.

278
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:10.560
I wanted to
change sports facilities in Ditzingen,

279
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:12.360
get into the local council, etc.

280
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:15.920
Changing sports facilities was
the impetus for Günther Oettinger?

281
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.760
For local politics.

282
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.000
That's all? Sports facilities?

283
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.800
My main interest was modern
sports facilities, Tatar tracks, etc.

284
00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:28.480
I made
proposals with the Young Union

285
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.280
and thus came to the municipal council.

286
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.200
I have another guess.
Namely? - VTR off.

287
00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:37.080
Greed is excessive ambition,

288
00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.360
often with base motives
and often at the expense of others.

289
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.720
During the years of politics I was
greedy for sleep and free time.

290
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.640
And on doing nonsense.

291
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.600
You just started the other day,
fooling around? - No.

292
00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.280
All my life.

293
00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.640
One controversial project
is "Stuttgart 21".

294
00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:08.280
I just heard from the director, we have
have a VTR from Daniel Freund.

295
00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.120
Shall we have a look? - Sure.
Can you make another one?

296
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.560
We don't have many left.
Gladly.

297
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.680
He sits
on the advisory board of "Herrenknecht",

298
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:20.680
the tunnel builders of Stuttgart 21,
a project,

299
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.200
which he helped to launch as prime minister
which he helped to launch as prime minister.

300
00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:29.320
His wife is building the shopping center
in the new station.

301
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:33.680
So this is a deal that is worth
worthwhile for the whole family.

302
00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.120
The Swabian has a taint,
is that how you say it?

303
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:39.600
May I answer?
Well, of course...

304
00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.920
My wife is on the board
of the "Living City" Foundation,

305
00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.520
which was founded by ECE,
on a voluntary basis.

306
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.400
ECE has built a center there,
not my wife.

307
00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:53.480
Do you actually earn
money with anything you do?

308
00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.840
So far, everything is voluntary.

309
00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.400
I am a lawyer,
Managing Director of a Consulting

310
00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:02.560
and on the Supervisory Board,
that's where I earn money.

311
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.160
So then you have 14 jobs,
six of them voluntary.

312
00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.280
According to Adam Ries
there is coal in eight jobs.

313
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.080
Yes. - Mhm.

314
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.040
But not as much,
as you get,

315
00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:17.160
but meeting fees as an advisory board member.

316
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.920
I do not have
eight other shows.

317
00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.840
But you're doing this full time.

318
00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.840
At rbb, this also falls
also falls under the heading of honorary.

319
00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.320
I am an advisory board
with six meetings a year ...

320
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.560
You don't work much, do you?
You have there once ...

321
00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.760
You are twisting my words around.
How many days are in a year? 365.

322
00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.960
Krömer, focus.
Do I work a lot or a little?

323
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.960
I am now
at 18 hours per year with you.

324
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:49.320
Or days, sorry.
18 days you work.

325
00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:52.320
On these advisory boards,

326
00:17:52.480 --> 00:17:55.360
otherwise I am
managing director of a consulting company.

327
00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.440
What is
with your wife and this department store?

328
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.680
Nothing at all. - You had
not finished explaining.

329
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:06.800
She opened the door and
there was the order for a department store?

330
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.800
Bullshit.
Now I've had enough.

331
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.480
A it is my life partner ...
Have you hit the table?

332
00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:15.520
An impertinence
from this guy and you.

333
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.240
My wife has
nothing to do with the department store.

334
00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.800
This is built and managed by ECE
managed, it has earned nothing.

335
00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.760
She has nothing to do with it.

336
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.640
Not that you're going to get mad now.
I am angry. - Why?

337
00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:33.480
You can argue with me
and pin things to my lapel.

338
00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.080
But not to my significant other.

339
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:39.480
The guy did that.
The guy is Daniel's friend.

340
00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:42.760
Your boyfriend, that's right.
This is not my friend.

341
00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:46.520
But your key witness.
Why? This is a politician.

342
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.040
Now you are laughing again.
What emotion are you having right now?

343
00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.640
Laughter, anger? A happiness
is a slice between us.

344
00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.600
When it comes to my partner
I don't join in the fun.

345
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.480
Okay, then...
You can invite them, not me.

346
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.640
Who? - It is not possible
that a third person

347
00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:11.040
is attacked by this guy
with 100% false claims.

348
00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.680
Unfortunately, he is not here,
we can't ask him. - Yes.

349
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:16.760
Next time.
* (SIGHS)

350
00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:19.360
Change topic?
Decide.

351
00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:21.320
Failure at the CDU?

352
00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.840
Yes, considerable. - Yes?

353
00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:27.840
24.1 % for the CDU
in Baden-Württemberg.

354
00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.000
That is minus 2.9%, the worst
worst election result to date.

355
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:36.240
They won 44.2% in 2006.

356
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.240
How does it feel
when you see a result like that?

357
00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:43.600
The percentage
has been around for ten or twelve years.

358
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.560
On the one hand, this has to do with ...

359
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.320
In purely mathematical terms, another ten years
and the CDU is at 0%.

360
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.400
Yes, that would be a logical curve,
but it won't happen.

361
00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:58.320
Mathematically, yes. - Winfried
Kretschmann is very popular.

362
00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:00.920
He deserves it.
Secondly ...

363
00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:05.000
He's not with the CDU, is he?
No, he's a Green.

364
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:10.280
Founding Green, since 1980
and almost cult in Baden-Württemberg.

365
00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.720
Secondly, we were
in the days before also

366
00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.480
by mask affair etc.
in free fall.

367
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.960
Of course, that's also an issue:

368
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.920
the disaster
of the mask affair in the CDU.

369
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.320
Do you have
tips for the young colleagues?

370
00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:29.040
First Parliament,
then cash in?

371
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:33.480
The vast majority of deputies
of all parliamentary groups and parties

372
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:37.600
exercises the mandate
with diligence and skill.

373
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:41.240
What do we do now with the CDU
and the corruption affair?

374
00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.320
They have now
clear conclusions in Berlin,

375
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:47.360
decided in Munich.

376
00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:49.280
And disclosure rules,

377
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.080
so that these individual cases
cannot give rise to subsequent cases.

378
00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.120
But the case has already happened.

379
00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.600
That is why
the public prosecutor's office.

380
00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.720
Or do you mean
this will never happen again?

381
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:08.360
You have drawn consequences,
returned the mandate

382
00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.840
and the public prosecutor's office
is investigating.

383
00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.240
Has all happened a little hesitantly,

384
00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:17.120
did not immediately resign from the mandate
and said, "Money back."

385
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:20.800
But already within a few days.
Yes? - Yes.

386
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:23.840
(sighs) There.

387
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:27.080
Can you still?
Do you still want to drink anything?

388
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:30.040
Refreshment sticks
or anything? - Thank you.

389
00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:32.440
I like you, Mr. Oettinger.

390
00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.920
You speak freely from the liver, as
here at the 2016 speech in Hamburg

391
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.840
about the meeting
with the Chinese delegation

392
00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.760
on the China-EU Annual Summit.

393
00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:45.680
Nine men, one party.

394
00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:48.360
No democracy ...

395
00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:52.720
no women quota,
no woman, logical.

396
00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:54.760
* Audience laughs. *

397
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.440
All suit, single breasted dark blue,

398
00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.320
all hair from left to right
combed with black shoe polish.

399
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:07.160
* Laughter *

400
00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.360
Misogynistic, xenophobic
and all in 20 seconds: Chapeau.

401
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.960
The whole thing was a bit pointed.

402
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:22.880
I am not misogynistic,
On the contrary. - Sounded like that.

403
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.640
Yes ... No.

404
00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:28.600
I only mentioned that there
there are no women on the committees,

405
00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.280
which is not entirely wrong.
I have with us ...

406
00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.560
If one then laughs maliciously, that is of
of course a joke against women.

407
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:40.080
I have fought in Brussels
fought for a 40% quota for women.

408
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:43.800
No one in Stuttgart,
Berlin or Brussels can say,

409
00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.520
that somehow I have the theme ...

410
00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.560
Have you enforced the women's quota
of 40 % through?

411
00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:52.120
To your credit?
Yes, that was Juncker and me.

412
00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.240
Is it also available in writing? - Yes.
Do you have it with you?

413
00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.920
In 2014, we were
in management at 30

414
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.480
and have made it to 40 within
to 40 within five years.

415
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:06.480
Unpleasant that this video
has surfaced, isn't it?

416
00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:10.040
No ...
I have such a hunch.

417
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:14.520
Is it possible that Daniel Freund
filmed with his cell phone? - No.

418
00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.920
He wasn't there.
You get paranoid, don't you?

419
00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.920
When speaking publicly
or semi-public speaking,

420
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.720
you have to assume
that someone is recording today.

421
00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:28.280
But you didn't realize that, did you?
Yes, I suspected that.

422
00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:32.000
During the same speech you
this also slipped out.

423
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:34.720
The German agenda
with maternity pension,

424
00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:36.760
Minimum pension, childcare allowance ...

425
00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:40.400
the funny toll,
that's not coming...

426
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.880
will soon still with mandatory homosexual marriage,
when it is introduced...

427
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.320
Compulsory homosexual marriage?
Have you already,

428
00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.800
when it becomes mandatory,
picked someone?

429
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.720
I am too old for this.
Good old friend of the show,

430
00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:56.160
Philipp Amthor, is single ...

431
00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.880
He was with you. He was good,
I think, quick-witted.

432
00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.080
Yes, also someone,
who knows about affairs.

433
00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.360
An affair. - What?
He had an affair.

434
00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.000
One too many, right?

435
00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.520
* Clear your throat * You're involved
in a beating fraternity

436
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.680
with the Landsmannschaft
Ulmia Tübingen.

437
00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.720
Can I see your schmiss?
I have four needles up there.

438
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.480
You did, did you? - Mhm.

439
00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:28.040
But you can not see.
No, I still have a full head of hair.

440
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:32.880
According to "Spiegel" you sang
at a fraternity meeting

441
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:34.600
"Germany above all".

442
00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.440
Is that true or is this another
a feint by Daniel Freund?

443
00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:42.960
That must have been ...
17, 18, 19 years ago.

444
00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:46.120
At that time we still sang
all three verses.

445
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.160
Seventeen years ago? - Yes.

446
00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:51.880
70 years ago, you mean.
17 years.

447
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:54.760
17 years ago you still sang
sang all the verses?

448
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.600
You can still do that today.

449
00:24:56.760 --> 00:25:03.320
The third is the official
verse of the song of the Germans.

450
00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.560
The first two
are not prohibited.

451
00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.120
By the way, the
were created in democratic times.

452
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.760
We sang that back then,
I stand by it.

453
00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.560
I don't do that anymore today.

454
00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:19.880
Why don't you do it anymore,
if it's all right?

455
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:22.720
Because the Landsmannschaften
have decided

456
00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.040
to take the two verses
out of their hymnal.

457
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.160
I see.
So in retrospect it was a mistake?

458
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.800
No.
But you don't do it anymore.

459
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.040
Would you sing it now
sing it in Camera 3? - No.

460
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.120
So you learned from that.

461
00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:40.720
No, in those days
this was not offensive.

462
00:25:41.040 --> 00:25:44.680
There were also other songs at that time,
which today are no longer

463
00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.800
in songbooks, hymnbooks
or hiking books has.

464
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:52.720
There were then debates
and it was decided:

465
00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:56.200
the third stanza, the
the other two no longer. - Okay.

466
00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:00.200
Let's agree on mistakes made,
17 years later understood.

467
00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:04.000
Moving on. 1991
you became parliamentary group chairman

468
00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:08.280
in Baden-Württemberg and lost
your driver's license with 1.4 per mille.

469
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.880
2007 at a party you put on two
two tea strainers on as glasses.

470
00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.840
Do you need alcohol,
to get going?

471
00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.760
The second was carnival.
We see the photo here.

472
00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:22.960
Where is the problem? - Did you
drunk the bottles alone?

473
00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:25.280
There is no one else sitting there.
Surely not.

474
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.080
That was carnival. There were ...

475
00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:32.240
(laughs) Well then! If it was carnival.
Sorry.

476
00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.040
Were you dressed as a bow tie?
You Berliners don't have a carnival.

477
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.960
We have carnival. - We have
Shrovetide, Mardi Gras and Carnival.

478
00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.400
Only carnival people came
and I took part in that, too.

479
00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.800
The thing was put to me.

480
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:49.240
Oh, you were just kidding?
I thought that was the costume.

481
00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.880
I didn't have a costume, I was
at work and came to it in the evening.

482
00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:57.640
There were 80 people.
80? - Or more.

483
00:26:57.800 --> 00:27:01.760
Did you say something ugly?
In the end, only one sat at the table.

484
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:07.880
(laughs) When I see pictures like this,
I think it's beautiful,

485
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.760
that I have been a sober alcoholic
alcoholic for ten years. Hallelujah.

486
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.080
I do not,
I like to drink a glass of wine.

487
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.400
(sighs) Good, Mr. Oettinger.
What do you mean, are you losing it?

488
00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:22.480
That's it. We're at the end.
It's boring.

489
00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:24.360
Boring?
No, but ...

490
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.600
I sometimes had the feeling
now you're going to break the table.

491
00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:30.960
Thank you very much.

492
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:36.480
This format provides,
that we still go out. - Mhm.

493
00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:40.520
I have a surprise for you.
Come with me. - With pleasure.

494
00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.160
Günther Oettinger ...

495
00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:46.240
Here is your sweetheart.

496
00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.240
(laughs) Mr. Friend.
Have a good evening.

497
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.280
Yes, I think we have to be like this.

498
00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.720
You must not shake hands,
because ...

499
00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.720
You can
sit down and relax here.

500
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:02.760
The conversation went
in depth.

501
00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:07.880
You don't have to say anything either,
Daniel Freund will take care of that.

502
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.320
I would ask you, Mr. Friend ...

503
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:14.280
The conclusion of the evening,
also on behalf of Mr. Oettinger,

504
00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.920
in camera 3, please.
Thank you first.

505
00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.640
Nice to meet
get to know each other in person.

506
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:22.160
I could if you want,

507
00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.360
now in your name
cancel the seven lobby jobs.

508
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.480
That would be a possibility,
I could offer you.

509
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:33.720
Then there would no longer be
so much money left over.

510
00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.920
That would be all voluntary.

511
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:41.320
Good. Do you want to
anything else to add?

512
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.040
Thank you.

513
00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:48.400
When the cameras go off:
Do we both get smacked?

514
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.400
* All laugh. *

515
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.120
We can go that way.

516
00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.440
Those were Günther Oettinger,
Daniel Freund.

517
00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.240
Unfortunately pandemic,
otherwise you could hug.

518
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:03.080
But you can exchange numbers.
Take care, neighbors. Bye!

519
00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.560
* Charles Aznavour: "Formidable" *

520
00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.880
# You are the one for me, for me

521
