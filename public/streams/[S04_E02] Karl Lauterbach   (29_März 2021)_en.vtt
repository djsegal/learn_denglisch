*Music

3
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.000
So, let's see,

4
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.920
what the cat today
put in front of the door.

5
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.480
Karl Lauterbach, 58 years old,

6
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.000
SPD member of the Bundestag
and epidemiologist.

7
00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.640
Talk show king 2020: 31 appearances,
17 of them with Markus Lanz.

8
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.400
Mr. Lauterbach?
Hello. Yes. Good evening.

9
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:40.720
Mr. Lauterbach, is this
authorized by Markus Lanz?

10
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.120
Are you allowed to be here?
He gave me the night off.

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.000
Has this been agreed with ZDF?

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.960
Not that we have to
have to set ourselves up for a lawsuit.

13
00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.520
Nope, all approved.
From the highest authority.

14
00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.480
If you want,
not that you get confused,

15
00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.680
you can also call me
Markus Lanz.

16
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.840
Nah, I'm still holding that apart.

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.360
You'll get it right, won't you?
So close. I'm glad.

18
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.480
Hello, Mr. Lauterbach.
Hello. Good evening, I greet you.

19
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.240
*he coughs*

20
00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.200
Hello.

21
00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.400
So, Mr. Lauterbach,
let's get started.

22
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.840
I have to say that I have had a total
with my editorial team.

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.440
The mood is at zero.

24
00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.240
Quite an icy wind,

25
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.480
that spills out of the editorial
from the editorial room.

26
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.320
We also
no longer talk to each other.

27
00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.080
Because the big question is:
Are you annoying or not?

28
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.400
That will become clear in the
show.

29
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.680
What are you for? You will soon
You'll soon find out.

30
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.600
Nah, I mean, with the number of
of appearances on talk shows.

31
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.560
Do you have the feeling
that you are annoying the population?

32
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.520
I don't have that feeling,
otherwise I wouldn't go there anymore,

33
00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.360
but I try,
to go only in broadcasts,

34
00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.440
where I think I can say something
that is interesting and new.

35
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.800
If this is not the case,
then you suck.

36
00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.080
I rather think that I
polarizing, but not annoying.

37
00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.520
People are either for
or against what I say.

38
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.080
They like to hear it or not.
But nerves are rather annoying.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.400
This is a reaction that I often
often read about, but which I do not feel.

40
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.240
Not even in letters.

41
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.280
I have many who agree with me,
also many who disagree with me.

42
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.640
But that I annoy people,
I don't feel that.

43
00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.400
Don't you think
that the mood could change?

44
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.840
That one then says: No, now I've changed
I've changed my mind.

45
00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.360
The 32nd appearance this year on
Markus Lanz, now he's getting on my nerves.

46
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.560
Then people just switch off.

47
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.840
If it were the case that people
could no longer see me

48
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.320
or would have the impression,
he repeats himself, the yada yada

49
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.120
is not knowledge, that is not
in the substance, that has no substance.

50
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.440
Then the ratings went down quickly,

51
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.240
the letters would be devastating,
I would no longer be invited.

52
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.720
Okay, but we can count on you
You've got this under control.

53
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880
We do not have to
not have to worry.

54
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.880
I don't have to worry about it.

55
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.480
When you know the Lauterbach Peak
has been reached, do you stop?

56
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.640
Then I will
no longer invited.

57
00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.440
We will then get in touch with you,
not you to us.

58
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.720
Then I will
no longer invited.

59
00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.720
Then you are the first,
to stop inviting me.

60
00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.520
Okay, well, you're here now.
Are you comfortable?

61
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.680
So far quite good. I do not know
the format at all. I see.

62
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.080
I must also say,
I don't mean to be insulting,

63
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.640
but I have never seen the show
never seen.

64
00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.120
And also did not know
your work until now. Yes.

65
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.960
But it was only spoken in the
highest tones.

66
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.200
Therefore
my expectations are high.

67
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.280
You have not dealt with the format
not dealt with?

68
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.840
No. I have never seen your show
never seen your show.

69
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.600
I also want to be honest.

70
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.880
I hope I haven't
my invitation now.

71
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.320
Well, I am now
already a little offended.

72
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.760
I just said it:
It was positively evaluated.

73
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.160
People recommended it to me:
You absolutely have to go there.

74
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.600
This guy brings it.
But I have never been there,

75
00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.320
do not know the program and can
not remember you so far.

76
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.080
That's very insulting, I think.
No, I...

77
00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.400
This is not only insulting,
but also devastating.

78
00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.800
No, honestly, I only hear
positive things, but I don't know you.

79
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.800
You have to be honest about that. I see.

80
00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.080
Well, I'm a sports reporter
and we're talking about soccer today.

81
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.200
Oh, then it's already over.
That brings us to the topic:

82
00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.560
One person who was very annoyed
of you was Bob Hanning.

83
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.400
Handball Vice President and
Managing Director of FÃ¼chse Berlin.

84
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.280
Let's take a look at the MAZ.

85
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.920
I have heard
that the policy

86
00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.640
is not only good for talk shows
is not only well suited for talk shows,

87
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.880
but also in finding solutions.

88
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.800
However, we now have
over 7 million children,

89
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.400
who for almost a year under 18
can not play sports.

90
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.760
And if we do not want to have a monoculture
of soccer,

91
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.680
other team sports will have to be saved as well.
sports will have to be saved as well.

92
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.600
If I am honest,
I am not fundamentally

93
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.600
a Lauterbach opponent, but he is
is sometimes a pain in the ass.

94
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.280
To comment on things
where you were not even there

95
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.680
and to have an answer to everything,
that gets on my nerves.

96
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.760
"Politics is not only well
in talk shows,

97
00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:30.160
but also
in finding solutions."

98
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.040
What do you say to that?
After all, that's what we live on:

99
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.280
90% of our work consists of,
finding solutions.

100
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.000
E.G.: What happens now
with the emergency brake?

101
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.840
What can we allow?
How can schools reopen?

102
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.160
How should the tests in schools and
and companies be organized?

103
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.040
How many tests do we have?
You can see the talk show appearances.

104
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.280
But not the much work,
that underlies it.

105
00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.960
The many studies that are read
the 1000 phone calls,

106
00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.600
Conversations with
other scientists,

107
00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.000
conversations among politicians, the
committee work, the plenary work, etc.

108
00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.360
A day like today, for example, which began
for me this morning at 7:30 a.m.

109
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.600
and does not end before 2 a.m.

110
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.120
From there: The talk show appearance
now with you...

111
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.800
Annoys you now.
He doesn't bug me.

112
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.800
That's lost time now.
No, not at all. I like being here.

113
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:29.080
I see. You like to be with people
you don't know.

114
00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.560
I have just said that I have heard
only heard the highest and...

115
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.200
It doesn't matter.
It's not just supposed to be about me.

116
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.800
I don't always want to see the same
people all the time. Yes. From there:

117
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.360
So far you have made only the very best
impression on me.

118
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.920
Good. Did you
that beforehand?

119
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.880
That sounds so...
No, spontaneous.

120
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.200
...so that it doesn't hurt me so much,
that you do not know me?

121
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.360
But anyway,
it's not supposed to be about me.

122
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.480
Let us
talk about soccer.

123
00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.760
There was also one of you annoyed:

124
00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:59.200
the coach from FC Bayern,
Hansi Flick.

125
00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.920
Slowly, one can no longer hear the so-called
experts can no longer be heard.

126
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:07.040
Mr. Lauterbach, too, quite honestly,
because you just brought it up,

127
00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:09.320
he always has something
to say about something.

128
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.480
Always a topic where he
then always reports back.

129
00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.040
Often then, too, when I am not
stand in the responsibility

130
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:20.040
and then look at the result at the end
what comes out of it,

131
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.680
then I can
always easy to evaluate.

132
00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.680
With Mr. Flick
you have spoken your mind.

133
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:27.680
Exactly. What do you discuss there?

134
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:29.960
We have talked well
talked.

135
00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:31.800
But first to the concrete...

136
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.080
I find three things
not right here:

137
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.320
When you say "so-called expert"
then one questions,

138
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.480
that he is a real expert.

139
00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.120
You'd have to say more.
You are a real expert.

140
00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.600
That is what I claim for myself,
that...

141
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.920
He may not have dealt with you
not dealt with you.

142
00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.840
I actually think that...

143
00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.600
We had a good conversation
with each other. I'll come to that in a moment.

144
00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:57.600
In any case, about the things
about which I express myself,

145
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:01.240
I have been working on this for a long time
about it, discuss it with others.

146
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.560
Second: He says I would
just express myself spontaneously.

147
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.080
I only express myself
when I am asked.

148
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.480
Thirdly, he says that everything can be said
everything easy to say,

149
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.240
if you were not
would be in the responsibility.

150
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:15.680
But we are
responsibility.

151
00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.640
The German Bundestag
decides these things, after all.

152
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:22.280
The German Bundestag
is responsible for these rules.

153
00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.680
We decide that and are therefore
and are therefore responsible.

154
00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:29.320
If we cause huge waves here
cause or do not brake,

155
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:32.680
we have not lived up to the responsibility
have not lived up to it.

156
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:37.080
Before Corona, they already had
the image of the admonisher and warner.

157
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.000
Let's take a look
a few headlines.

158
00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.680
Lauterbach warns,

159
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.000
Lauterbach warns,

160
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.000
Lauterbach warns,

161
00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.000
Lauterbach warns,

162
00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:52.240
Lauterbach warns,

163
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.160
Lauterbach warns,

164
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.280
Lauterbach warns against tanning salons.

165
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.920
What was the warning
with the tanning salons?

166
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.200
Can you still remember that?

167
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.800
That the tanning salons
Make skin cancer.

168
00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.800
Especially among young people,
with young people.

169
00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.560
But that's just the way it is for someone
who is an epidemiologist.

170
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.000
For the is in the political business

171
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.040
the warning
a widely used currency.

172
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.200
Sometimes we also guess. We guess,
but that is done less.

173
00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.160
Guessing is then better than warning.

174
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.960
For example, we advise more exercise,
to more sleep.

175
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.440
In principle, we advise the things
that we do not do ourselves.

176
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.240
And we warn about the rest.

177
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.000
Let's take a look at how
Angela Merkel on the subject of vaccines

178
00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:38.680
the crisis management
of the government. MAZ from.

179
00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.200
You have to ask yourself: What went wrong?
actually gone wrong?

180
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.200
I believe that, on the whole, nothing
on the whole, nothing went wrong.

181
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:49.800
And that we get, first of all,
what was promised,

182
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.200
that was the first result yesterday.

183
00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.840
Then the question is in the room:
Why is the USA faster?

184
00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.040
Why is Israel faster,
why Great Britain?

185
00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.280
Of course, that worries you.

186
00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.920
Would the sentence
come from your lips as well?

187
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.000
that actually
nothing went wrong at all?

188
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:12.400
The EU vaccine procurement program
of the EU went almost all wrong,

189
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.280
that has to be said openly.

190
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.320
I often agree with Merkel
and that should here

191
00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.200
not be a party-political occupation,
but one must be honest:

192
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.840
The EU received the order from us
to provide the vaccines.

193
00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:28.520
This would have been an incredibly important
important opportunity for the EU,

194
00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.840
a completely different stand
for the population,

195
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.160
she would have been very
useful.

196
00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:35.960
There were many scientists,

197
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:39.120
who recommended that it be done
as the U.S. is doing today:

198
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:41.960
To buy the vaccine
like an investor:

199
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.840
I.e. I buy shares of the company,
where I buy.

200
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.880
I can then also influence
on what the company does,

201
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.320
Building the production capacity.

202
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.720
The Americans have bought vaccine
bought, but at the same time

203
00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.600
paid so much for the vaccine
that they were able to obtain with it,

204
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:01.480
that additional factories
are being built.

205
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:04.920
Three factories have been built for Biontech in the
have been built in the USA.

206
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.040
Moderna: several factories.

207
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:09.760
In Europe was purchased by
purchased by the EU

208
00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.880
like an ordinary customer.

209
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:15.640
And in the end, no one knows:
Which vaccine is good now?

210
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.560
Let me ask you a question:
My mother is 72 years old.

211
00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:21.640
She is about to be vaccinated.
What do we whistle for her?

212
00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.960
All vaccines are viable.

213
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:27.360
The distinction between 1st and
2nd class for vaccines

214
00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.160
makes no sense.

215
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.080
When it comes to vaccination, it all comes down to this:

216
00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:35.240
What prevents your mother from
a hospitalization,

217
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.200
serious illness or death?

218
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:41.400
All three vaccines accomplish this,
that we currently have on offer:

219
00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:44.200
Moderna, Biontech
and Astra alike.

220
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.480
Thus, it makes no difference.

221
00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.920
She has a vaccination appointment
in 2 weeks.

222
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.320
I can now
go home and say:

223
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:54.000
Mom, I talked to
Karl Lauterbach...

224
00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.040
Whatever the vaccine is,
all three vaccines...

225
00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.240
...lean back. Let it fly.
Yeah. Roll up your sleeves and go for it.

226
00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.880
Exactly. Very easy.

227
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.720
And even after the first vaccination,

228
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.160
2 weeks later she is
out of the woods already.

229
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.200
That is a privilege,
one can really say,

230
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:15.320
if she gets the vaccination
so early now.

231
00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.600
For a 72-year-old, this is a
relatively early vaccination in Berlin.

232
00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:21.440
I don't know right now either,

233
00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.480
why my mother
gets the vaccination earlier.

234
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.160
I don't know.
I'm not behind it.

235
00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.040
She is reasonably early,
but wonderful. That's how it is then.

236
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.680
Is that okay or should I tell her
should I tell her to let someone else go first?

237
00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:37.600
All good,
everything has its correctness.

238
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:39.400
I'm just wondering,

239
00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:42.280
how my mother
approached the appointment.

240
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.680
Yes, she has succeeded.
This is an early appointment. Very good.

241
00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.400
Whichever vaccine...
It doesn't matter? It doesn't matter. Ok.

242
00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.360
Let us summarize
the crisis management.

243
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.040
The Corona warning app
is a failure.

244
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.600
The citizens were not
from the beginning

245
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.280
with medical or
FFP2 masks supplied,

246
00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.360
Homes for the elderly and nursing homes
not sufficiently protected.

247
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.960
The public health departments are still
miserably equipped and

248
00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:11.560
the disaster with the rapid tests
we also still have to deal with.

249
00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.560
What is the question?
Why did so much go wrong?

250
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.360
Not everything is
as it is just described.

251
00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:22.800
But there are a few things
went into the vetches.

252
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.200
They didn't work well.

253
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.960
"Into the vetches"? What does that mean?
They didn't work out. I see.

254
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.320
This is a
Rhineland expression,

255
00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.360
when something has gone wrong.

256
00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:37.040
It went wrong.
It went wrong.

257
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.320
I have now
into camera 3.

258
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.960
Otherwise we would have had to
had to synchronize.

259
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.800
Things that went wrong and
the things that went wrong,

260
00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:49.000
I don't give grades,
who is to blame.

261
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.240
I do not assign blame.
blame.

262
00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:54.760
I don't dwell on that.

263
00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.480
Crisis management
is also difficult,

264
00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.560
to hold the store together there.

265
00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.280
We look again at the
summary of Mrs. Merkel.

266
00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.880
We are now trying
to build the bridges,

267
00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.880
but we also don't know
where exactly we're going to build them.

268
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.960
After all, we can't see the shore either.

269
00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.880
That's what's so difficult about a
difficult thing about a pandemic,

270
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.400
that you don't know the end.

271
00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.080
Do you understand that now?
Yes.

272
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:25.520
From the end I understood,
that you don't know the end.

273
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:29.120
We are in the middle of the crisis
and Mrs. Merkel is now building bridges.

274
00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.080
Yes, and you don't know the end.
That's all I understood either.

275
00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.120
It's like that, isn't it?
I thought I was stupid at first.

276
00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:39.520
Nope, at first I did not understand it either
understood, but never mind.

277
00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.440
Maybe if you and I
build a bridge now.

278
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.400
Yes. You on one side,
me on the other.

279
00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:47.400
Then her part is
4 m higher than mine.

280
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:49.600
We can fall into the water
or so,

281
00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.240
in any case
the outcome of the matter is open.

282
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:56.440
That is probably
the intellectual content.

283
00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.520
Okay, we'll have to invite Mrs. Merkel
herself in the fall.

284
00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:03.560
The next question would be:
In a just world

285
00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:05.720
you would be Jens Spahn, wouldn't you?

286
00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.240
I do not know how
answer to this now.

287
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.520
But long story short:

288
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.880
I work closely and well with Jens Spahn
closely and well.

289
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.240
There is nothing more to say about it.
Envy is out of place.

290
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:21.880
But now was called envy, just.

291
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.920
Yes, but still
envy is out of place.

292
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.600
Jens Spahn makes his...

293
00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.080
But if you speak only briefly
and then use the word "envy",

294
00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:33.280
if everything would go bombastic,
one would say after all:

295
00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:34.960
He is my colleague.

296
00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:38.680
The fact that I hold the office
of the Minister of Health,

297
00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:42.720
I would have gotten it at that time,
would have refused it is absurd.

298
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.280
I don't give away secrets,
I would have taken it.

299
00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:50.400
Why didn't you take it?
Because I wasn't offered it.

300
00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.560
I see. That's right.
I would have taken it.

301
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:58.240
But I would also not have
overwhelming demands.

302
00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:03.680
But that's just not how it was.
It goes on. All is well. Okay.

303
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:06.680
A quick question:

304
00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.640
You served as deputy
Parliamentary Group Chairman of the SPD

305
00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.520
in the Bundestag, responsible for the
Health topic until 2017.

306
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.600
Who is doing it now? BÃ¤rbel Bas.

307
00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.080
This is BÃ¤rbel Bas.

308
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:23.920
She is the deputy
Parliamentary Group Chairwoman in the Bundestag,

309
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:26.560
responsible for the topic
health policy.

310
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.280
Sounds funny, but that's how it is.

311
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.920
Why has the woman
never heard of the woman?

312
00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:33.520
I hear from her regularly.

313
00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.040
And can therefore confirm:
BÃ¤rbel Bas exists.

314
00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.880
Do they really exist
or is the woman

315
00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.320
a closed mailbox company?

316
00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.680
BÃ¤rbel Bas is a totally nice,
kind and good colleague,

317
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.800
who also knows her way around well,
and we also work well together.

318
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.680
But you are in the foreground.

319
00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:56.280
Yes, I may have
more experience and have been around longer.

320
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.440
That's how it is at the moment.
Is that so?

321
00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.080
Yes, and also it is now
with the focus,

322
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:06.600
I have always done,
preventive medicine, epidemiology,

323
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.280
networked, Unityp probably so,
that for the pandemic

324
00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:16.040
the more interesting interlocutor
for some colleagues.

325
00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.160
Does she see it that way?
I don't know.

326
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.280
Or did you dictate it that way?
Like this: Let me.

327
00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:24.360
Nah, I think it's all good.

328
00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:27.760
We work well together.
I appreciate them very much.

329
00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.800
Envy? No, no envy. All good.

330
00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.400
I have given up the office
voluntarily.

331
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.480
But didn't Mrs. Bas
not even called and said,

332
00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.280
she would also like to go on Lanz?

333
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.240
She would have to call Lanz.
That's the problem.

334
00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:44.200
Is that how it works, that you politicians
Lanz calls and says:

335
00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.800
I'm coming now?
No, it's not like that with me.

336
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.160
I have never
with even such valuable formats,

337
00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.040
as much as I would like to go there,
like tonight, for example

338
00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.160
I still would not have
not come up with the idea,

339
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.320
to call you and ask for
to ask for an invitation.

340
00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.720
Of course, you did not know
you didn't know me at all.

341
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:08.040
You did not know
that I existed.

342
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.360
After all, they were recommended to me.
That's how it is in life.

343
00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.360
Yes, good. Where are we?

344
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.000
Christian Drosten has reduced his
his media presence.

345
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.000
Is that also an option for you?
Of course. Of course. When?

346
00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:24.160
When I get the impression
that things are going super well

347
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.320
and my contribution has been made.

348
00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:28.760
Firstly, I will then be
less requested

349
00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:32.600
and secondly, I will then probably
will be less available.

350
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.520
It's like this.

351
00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.520
And you always commute between
Berlin and Cologne,

352
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.720
Cologne and Berlin
and the Lanz studio in Hamburg.

353
00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:44.120
Aren't you afraid
that you will infect yourself?

354
00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:47.920
I protect myself accordingly
with an FFP3 mask,

355
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.400
but without a valve, so that I
also not endanger anyone else.

356
00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:55.440
Oh, that's the FFP2 and you have
the 3? I have the FFP3 mask.

357
00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:59.960
The gold-plated one.
Yes, a gold platinum edition.

358
00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.640
With integrated intercom
for the cell phone. No, a normal one.

359
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.880
There are FFP3 masks,
which are without a valve. Yes.

360
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.640
They breathe quite well.
And you drive very safely with them.

361
00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:14.720
It's just like in the lab. I see.
From that point of view, everything is good.

362
00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:17.240
I do not get infected
during the trips.

363
00:19:17.400 --> 00:19:19.560
I have only
the cheap FFP2 masks.

364
00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.160
They are not cheap.
They are also good enough.

365
00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.480
In any case, I drive in such a way
so that I don't endanger anyone.

366
00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.440
And I test myself every day.

367
00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.640
You wanted to be SPD leader in 2019,
but you lost. What was the reason?

368
00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:36.800
I still don't understand that.
Definitely not with the program.

369
00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:39.600
I wanted to represent the SPD
together with Nina Scheer

370
00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:43.440
to a more ecologically
oriented course.

371
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:47.160
I am very impressed
by the catastrophic development

372
00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.320
on climate change, keyword:
There he goes warning again.

373
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.040
Yes. There is only reason to warn.

374
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:57.440
And even compared
to the Corona pandemic

375
00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:01.600
this is a completely different
another dimension, a huge issue.

376
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.520
From there I had hoped,

377
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.720
that the party would become much more
ecologically oriented.

378
00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.520
I fought there with Nina Scheer
fought together.

379
00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:13.640
We also have a
good, programmatic view,

380
00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.520
but we have only
managed the fourth place.

381
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:20.040
Isn't it sad when you are then
overtaken by Saskia Esken?

382
00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.720
I now work well with Saskia Esken.
now work well together.

383
00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:27.320
Envy? We just spoke on the phone
on the phone. No, not envy.

384
00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.240
Everyone finds their place here.
Even without a party chairmanship.

385
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:35.360
I would have liked to become party chairman
without any ifs or buts.

386
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:38.600
But even without the party chair
it went on.

387
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.680
There are always new tasks coming.

388
00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.560
But if the vote were today,
you would be party leader now, wouldn't you?

389
00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:47.760
I don't know.
Maybe. I have no idea.

390
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.960
In any case, I would have
gladly become

391
00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:52.960
and also wanted to set a different
to set a different accent.

392
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.320
That's why I regretted it very much.
That was also close to my heart at the time.

393
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.080
To this day, I still don't know what
that it didn't work out.

394
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:02.200
Karl Lauterbach, German Chancellor?

395
00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.400
I have definitely
not yet thought about

396
00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.240
and also does not play a role.

397
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.080
At the moment I am happy to be
to be elected to parliament.

398
00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.360
The first chancellor to finally
on the table and warns everyone.

399
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.000
Yes, but as I said...
But isn't that so...

400
00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:21.200
It's annoying, this reduction
of work to warning.

401
00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.600
95% of my work consists of working with
anyone to make solutions,

402
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:29.000
think about it,
how do we get this done, how this.

403
00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:33.000
The reduction to warning
is too cheap.

404
00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.840
Ok. Shall we talk again about
Markus Lanz again? Gladly, even.

405
00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.320
You were on Lanz more
than Lanz himself.

406
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:43.240
I mean, I would have always
seen, but I can be wrong

407
00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.920
Colleagues in the parliamentary group are gossiping
about you behind closed doors:

408
00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.600
quirky, difficult
in social behavior, loner.

409
00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:56.600
Is that envy or do your colleagues
colleagues can't do anything with you?

410
00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:00.400
These are backbenchers,
who appear without names

411
00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:04.000
and probably
talk about themselves.

412
00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:07.040
Oh, was that anonymous? Yes, of course.
I see.

413
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.280
After all, the people are not named.

414
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.720
Otherwise we would have
already clarified this bilaterally.

415
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.680
These are certainly not people
from the first row.

416
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.480
About a colleague
something so negative...

417
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.760
especially since these are also
are untrue attributions,

418
00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:27.440
at least in my perception,
but you can also see it differently.

419
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.680
In any case, if you
speak disparagingly about colleagues,

420
00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.880
to be able to contribute in a portrait
to be able to contribute a few words,

421
00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.760
that is poor.

422
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:39.680
To be honest, I even praise
even a guy like Hansi Flick.

423
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:43.840
Or the handball player Hannig or what.
Bob Hanning. Bob Hanning. Exactly.

424
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.640
I am very happy with this one,

425
00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.480
that before the lockdown
to failure could.

426
00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:50.560
Yeah, he's so.. Great guy.

427
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.080
But then they have
at least have the guts

428
00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:55.320
and attack with open sights.

429
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:58.720
Then you have a debate
and then it's all right.

430
00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.040
But they are
not sportsmen!

431
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.800
If they were anonymous cowards,
then we cut out the question.

432
00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:08.600
No, it can stay in,
but they're all anonymous voices.

433
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:11.200
During the 2009 election campaign you invited
Invited citizens

434
00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:14.440
on "Healthy grilling with Lauterbach
without sausage,

435
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:16.400
but with fish and without salt.

436
00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:19.120
Did anyone come
with the offer?

437
00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:23.120
Yes, people came,
but it was a tough campaign.

438
00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.920
The most difficult appointment
I had at the time was with Sigmar Gabriel,

439
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:29.640
at the time he was Minister of the Environment,
denied.

440
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.360
He wanted to top the healthy offer
still top,

441
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:36.280
by grilling not with coal,
but with a solar grill.

442
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:39.080
We had invited 30 or
40 journalists invited

443
00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:43.440
and the fish did not get warm because
the solar grill did not work.

444
00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:45.680
Although the sun was shining brightly...

445
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:49.720
So there was no bratwurst,
but fish that was not cooked.

446
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.840
There was nothing. Forever and 3 days
the journalists waited.

447
00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.320
The grill did not
not the temperature.

448
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.720
The fish remained
more or less raw.

449
00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.720
Therefore we had
a horrible press.

450
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.480
You can well imagine.

451
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.080
Yes, well, already with the offer
I would have stayed at home.

452
00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:10.600
At another appointment
with the press,

453
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:14.080
where we had a barbecue,
at that time the Hartz 4 laws

454
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:19.240
still in everyone's head, we had
we tuna with the best olive oil.

455
00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:23.040
And then a journalist
calculated that you could

456
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.120
such a barbecue only once
in the month with Hartz 4 could afford.

457
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.040
That wasn't so good either.
A complete fiasco.

458
00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.960
Would you do it that way again?
Absolutely not.

459
00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:36.600
The election campaign was tight and hard.
Work with photomontage.

460
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.800
No, the topics must be better
set. These are youth mistakes.

461
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.320
I would have one more topic:
The WELT quoted you as saying

462
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:47.800
"Sex is fun and healthier the more
healthier the more you have of it."

463
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.400
Thank God. That's once
from Karl Lauterbach without warning.

464
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.320
Without anything. No reminding.
Just say: more sex.

465
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:57.520
Do you have any tips?
Nope. Without salt.

466
00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:01.800
I do not want to go into the details.
The other fills the imagination.

467
00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.880
But if I said that at the time
that will reflect the state of affairs at the time.

468
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:09.160
of the scientific studies
have circumscribed.

469
00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.560
I see. Not anymore?
Yes, probably also.

470
00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:16.240
Okay, Mr. Lauterbach.
That's it. Finished already? Yes.

471
00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.720
All clear. Wonderful.
Are you glad it's over?

472
00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:22.840
Nah, it was fun.
Yes? Really. Really now?

473
00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.560
Yes, indeed. Yes, no?
It was fun.

474
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:29.680
Envy? Was envy involved? Envy is
not a category for me. Honestly.

475
00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.080
I am not envious.
At least I try to be.

476
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.200
All is well.
And thank you for the opportunity.

477
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.880
The file closes.

478
00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:43.120
And I come to the conclusion that
you are not bugging me. Thank you.

479
00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.240
I really appreciate that.

480
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.320
The fact is,
that we always say,

481
00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.280
Politicians should please tell the truth
they should not lie.

482
00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:54.000
And now comes one
like Karl Lauterbach,

483
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.840
addresses unpleasant things that
we all have to stay at home

484
00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.200
and a Playstation 5
is not available for Christmas either.

485
00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:04.640
And now everyone says that sucks.
So what do we do now?

486
00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.480
With the Playstation 5
I would have no problem.

487
00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.120
It's not a thing at all.

488
00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:12.520
Do you play Playstation 5?
Nah, I don't play.

489
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:16.920
That is no longer so widespread in my generation.
no longer so widespread.

490
00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:21.720
What was it with you?
VIC20 or Commodore 64?

491
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:25.560
Commodore 64 is back then...
Giana Sisters, do you remember it?

492
00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.240
I do not know that.

493
00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.680
But Commodore 64 played a role
and programming in Fortran 4

494
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.080
with punch cards,
that was in my day.

495
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:37.120
Is that what you did back then?
To come down.

496
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.480
Not to get down.
I did that at university.

497
00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:43.920
One could say that you were
a gambler. I was not.

498
00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.280
But in fact I wish
I would have been better.

499
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.360
What the kids are doing today,
there's a lot of complaining.

500
00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.160
There are warnings that the
Video games are dangerous and so.

501
00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:56.400
This does not correspond
not the study situation,

502
00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.720
to say something positive.

503
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.000
You don't warn there? No.
You can simply say...

504
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.840
Not every game, but...
I can tell my mother today:

505
00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.600
You may get vaccinated
what you want

506
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.760
and today I can
go to my children and say:

507
00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:14.560
Turn on the Playstation
and I'm going to bed.

508
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.600
I'll bring another positive,

509
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.480
scientifically not yet
not quite secured,

510
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.360
but in the process of being secured
study situation:

511
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:26.400
Certain skill and speed
and speed video games,

512
00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.920
e.g. action games, also for
older people, gladly made,

513
00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:33.040
have a preventive effect against dementia.

514
00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.560
Then I'm doing everything right. Yes.
What a wonderful closing word.

515
00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.720
Please still come out.

516
00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:44.800
The mask I must now...

517
00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.320
Nah, we just have to
keep our distance.

518
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.680
We have the safety wall here.

519
00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.680
Aha, I thought,
this was an interrogation room.

520
00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.000
Caution. Don't run into...
Do you know this from the carnival?

521
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.440
There is also always
this glass maze.

522
00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.600
So, in conclusion, the question:

523
00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:03.960
Corona epidemic, when is
the shit finally over?

524
00:28:04.120 --> 00:28:06.480
The pandemic is over
next year.

525
00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:10.280
This year, however, we will
the most important thing behind us.

526
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:13.200
The summer will be
become much better.

527
00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.400
I still hope,
that it will be a super summer,

528
00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:19.520
when the risk groups
all have the primary vaccination

529
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.880
and we have
mastered the third wave.

530
00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.640
Now come the
most important, difficult months,

531
00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.280
where we once again
need to stand together.

532
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:30.640
By 2022, we will have everything under control
vaccines will have everything under control.

533
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.560
That's good with you politicians,
They tap you and say:

534
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.760
1:30 minute what raushauen
and bang, it's delivered.

535
00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.640
Must go. Wonderful. Top guest.
Thank you, Karl Lauterbach. Thank you also.

536
00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:43.360
Take care, neighbors.
