* Music *

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.600
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

4
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.880
Sido: 39 years old,
musician and friend.

5
00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.200
Sido? Yes.

6
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:27.960
Are you there yet? Yes.

7
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.040
Tell me, is there anything
to promote, a new record?

8
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.160
Get that shit out of here,
then we'll have the shit behind us.

9
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.520
No, there is not. All good.
Very good. Top guest.

10
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.240
* Audience laughs. *

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.880
Tippi toppi.

12
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.280
* long humming *

13
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.840
* Hum *

14
00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.000
* Hum stops. *

15
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.440
This is scary.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.440
* Hum *
* Laughter *

17
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.120
Doctor.
Morning, Sido. Well?

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.760
Yes ... How do we do it?
Come here.

19
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.480
I'm glad you're here.
Nice to see you too.

20
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.120
So ...

21
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.080
Sido, there you have
a fat Otto.

22
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.280
Yes? What have I done?

23
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.640
The cup?
Well, I do not know ...

24
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.400
Is this an interrogation situation?
Are you the police?

25
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.720
No, we do tabloid theater.

26
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.640
I'm Heidi Kabel, here comes
"Gossip in the Stairwell." * (LAUGHING)

27
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.840
Okay, the situation
was somehow familiar to me.

28
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.720
* Laughter *

29
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.160
Is all your hair still real?
Yes.

30
00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.800
Take off your cap.

31
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.520
Gray.
Turned gray, huh? Yeah yeah.

32
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.960
Quite gray! Yes.
Don't you dye? No.

33
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.320
You?

34
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.520
No. No.
* (LAUGHING)

35
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.640
(laughs) All human hair.

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.320
With you one can always say: You
you have allowed yourself a fat Otto.

37
00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.160
There's always something.

38
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.320
Something will have happened.
And what was going on?

39
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.160
Actually, everything as always.
I have done nothing.

40
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.040
That's what they all say.

41
00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.760
We come to your file.
Have you already helped yourself?

42
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.840
There was already water in here.
Is there no alcohol, or what?

43
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.280
No alcohol.
Filly cup. Beautiful.

44
00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.120
(laughs) I'm a collector.
Of cups? Only Filly cups.

45
00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.560
Is that Filly?
Yes. I have everything from Filly.

46
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.880
Also the castle.
Do you know the Filly castle? M-m.

47
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.600
The best. Really?
The ivory castle of Filly. Oh.

48
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.040
A lot of plastic probably?
Does not matter.

49
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.040
Degrades after 4,000 years.
* Laughter *

50
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.040
Are you that kind of eco guy?

51
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.560
No, but I'm already noticing ...
Oh, we'll cut that out.

52
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.520
That's trouble,
because it goes against the ecos.

53
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.120
Wait a minute. Don't...
Do the head again ...

54
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.680
No, different. Because of cut.
No, like this.

55
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.920
Like this? Hold it like this.

56
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.560
Cut!
* (LAUGHING)

57
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.120
... like me, I suppose,
ecologically on it. Yes.

58
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.560
I at least notice when you
walk through a toy store,

59
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.040
that you are actually
walking through a plastic store.

60
00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.920
Terrible. Everything is plastic.
I could spit. Yes.

61
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.080
And how long does that last?
4,000 years.

62
00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.800
That would be okay,
but it lasts three days.

63
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.040
Once it settles ...
We no longer have anything to do with that.

64
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.440
You carry the broken toys
of the children into the cellar

65
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.720
and then waits 4,000 years
until it decomposes.

66
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.360
We do.

67
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.560
Sido, I'd like to start
so that we get in the mood,

68
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.800
start with a fun theme.
Yes.

69
00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:55.600
Dying. Good.
Death. Mhm.

70
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.920
You know? Yes.
How do you imagine your death?

71
00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.160
How it happens or
how you should deal with it then?

72
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.000
How to deal with it?
All of you.

73
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.760
Did you know,
you are also a Berlin original,

74
00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.120
that the rbb
will report on your death?

75
00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.920
You think so?
It's a fact.

76
00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:22.760
You will be laid to rest
in the memorial church. * Yes.

77
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.320
I don't know...
* Laughter *

78
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.520
There is no one here, but I can hear
the audience at home laughing. Yes.

79
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.720
Because they think it's funny?
No, it's like this.

80
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.640
It's really...
Yes, one of us will.

81
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.880
After one of us
a street is named after one of us in Berlin.

82
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.960
Sido Street?
No, Paul-Würdig-Strasse.

83
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.760
Paul-Würdig-Strasse? And where?
In the Märkisches Viertel.

84
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.640
Oh! What about me?
I'm in Neukölln.

85
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.760
Yes, if there is a street
does not yet have an Arabic name.

86
00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.200
The Kurt-Krömer-Platz. A dream.
Hermannplatz? That would be cool.

87
00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.000
Tear down Karstadt completely
and put a memorial there.

88
00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.760
A golden pyramid.

89
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:12.160
A golden pyramid! But please leave
please leave the currywurst store.

90
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.320
This is now a kebab store.
On Hermann... No.

91
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.440
On the Hermannplatz ... No, the
Currywurst store is not always there.

92
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.680
Hasenheide?
He's only there sometimes.

93
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.080
Sometimes it's somewhere
where it's more lucrative or something.

94
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.080
He stands in the square some days.
You, but you know what?

95
00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.920
That's his problem.

96
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.240
Why?
I'm not interested.

97
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.240
But then I can't eat currywurst
anymore. Watch out.

98
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.680
When a celebrity dies,
rbb reports about it

99
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.800
and it falls into the category
entertainment editorial department. Oy.

100
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:49.600
No, I don't want that then.

101
00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:53.880
I am afraid that the rbb
will take care of my funeral.

102
00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.960
I can then do nothing more.

103
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.640
With you this happens
sooner than with me.

104
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.760
Let's say the editorial staff of the rbb
is single-handedly responsible for this.

105
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.440
I'm about to die because of it.
* (LAUGHING)

106
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.880
Then complete idiots like Harald
Glööckler sit in the front row,

107
00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.800
with whom I have never had anything to do.

108
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.000
They invite them,
because they don't have my contacts.

109
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.440
Then Harald Glööckler says: "A good friend has
good friend has passed away."

110
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.640
Then I fall
out of the coffin and puke. * Laughter *

111
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.800
I think when you die

112
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.320
and then still
can still think about something like that,

113
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.040
then you don't give a shit.

114
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.960
You say: Do with this shell,
what you want.

115
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:43.200
It's all good.
I can't say that, I'm dead.

116
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.760
You can only tell yourself,
but if you can still think,

117
00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:50.320
you'd be stupid to waste your time
with thoughts about it,

118
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.200
what happens to your body.

119
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.680
I was at Wolfgang Rademann's
funeral, God rest his soul.

120
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.120
I have never heard that name before.

121
00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.800
Fritzel Schnitzel,
Wolfgang Rademann ... Dreamboat!

122
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.200
An old Berliner!
What is a dreamboat?

123
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.240
Dreamboat!
* Hums the dreamboat melody. *

124
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.880
Still can't get me.
"Traumschiff," ZDF.

125
00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.920
Oh, I'm not allowed to say.
Wait, hold your head like this.

126
00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.560
* Laughter *

127
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.720
"Traumschiff," rbb.
* Laughter *

128
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.840
I don't know it.
You can't be serious.

129
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.320
He shot with all of them and was
Peter Alexander's press spokesman.

130
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.760
I have heard the name before,
but individually.

131
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.600
I know Peter and Alexander.
* Laughter *

132
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:42.720
You have to take this seriously,
or I'll break it off. * (LAUGHING)

133
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:45.360
Stop laughing. Sorry.

134
00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.040
You can continue,
the cut was already.

135
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.080
This was not a freeze.
I would smoke a cigarette.

136
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:57.560
You can't smoke, I've already explained that to
I have already explained to Ms. Thomalla.

137
00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:00.440
I am allowed to smoke,
because I am a figure of art.

138
00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:03.640
You would get trouble
from the German Medical Association.

139
00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.760
But backstage is okay? Yes.

140
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.560
There you can drink, smoke pot ...

141
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.240
You don't smoke anymore?
* (LAUGHING)

142
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.080
Yes, you can. You can smoke pot.
* (LAUGHING)

143
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:20.440
Is it raining outside or what?

144
00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.000
Does it splash against the window?

145
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.520
You can smoke pot.
That is medicine.

146
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:30.280
We can say: Did you
from the pharmacy, for relaxation.

147
00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:34.240
I have nothing here in this room.
Okay.

148
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.760
* loud laughter *

149
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.520
Please go to Sido's dressing room.

150
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:44.040
If you find hash, take it away from him and put it
and put it in my dressing room.

151
00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.960
For medical reasons.
Put down a piece of paper:

152
00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.560
"Dear Mr. Sido,
it's an emergency."

153
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.680
Not that he dies and
the rbb takes over the funeral.

154
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:56.960
I would like to have
at the water klops at the Ku'damm

155
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.360
a golden pyramid,
which is 100 meters high.

156
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:05.080
At the bottom everything is made of glass
and then I am laid out like this.

157
00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.800
I would like to have
the red shoes from the pope.

158
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.880
Mummified?
With a wax mask.

159
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.560
So that one does not see
that I am dead.

160
00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:19.400
One part of the pyramid is to
project four meters onto the Ku'damm,

161
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:21.040
so that there is traffic jam every day.

162
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.080
Are you standing at Madame Tussauds?
No. You?

163
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.520
I was asked today.
Boah, we'll cut that out.

164
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.440
What? * (LAUGHING)
No, wait a minute.

165
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.640
Huh? Really?
Yes. Are you jealous?

166
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.360
Because I...
* (LAUGHING)

167
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.480
You got a request for that?
Yes.

168
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.240
You're much younger than me.
Yes, but... Yes.

169
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.080
Who is the original Berliner?
Me.

170
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.960
Me too.
Yes, both of them.

171
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:55.880
But ... Now I'm telling everyone
what you always say. * (LAUGHING)

172
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.720
Now I'm telling everyone.

173
00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.200
So, light on.

174
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.760
This man dadrin,
felon, gangster, murderer,

175
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.400
always says that he is
is more Harald Juhnke than I am.

176
00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.680
Wait a minute.
Now I've said it.

177
00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.920
I didn't say it like that.
Yes, you did.

178
00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.320
I said that you and I ...
Get out your phone and show ...

179
00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.360
Harald Juhnke, as he sits
sitting in a television broadcast,

180
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.960
z. E.g. with Gucci sweater.
* Laughter *

181
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.280
Hm. Wait a minute, I have ...

182
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:33.760
Am I right in thinking
that you're going to be measured?

183
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.480
No, I can't imagine
my wax figure standing there.

184
00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.880
Say you don't want it.
"Take Krömer." Take Krömer.

185
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:45.120
Do that. Yes.
Otherwise I won't let you out.

186
00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:47.680
I have other
other files on you.

187
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:53.120
These files here
are full of smut.

188
00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:56.520
There is only one theme in there,
that isn't... dick pics?

189
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.680
Pecker pictures are okay.

190
00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.680
There is another issue,
that please don't bring up. Exactly.

191
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.920
That's in there.
* (LAUGHING)

192
00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.160
That's what we're talking about.
Say it into the camera.

193
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.320
Madame Tussauds, are you listening to me?

194
00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.680
No, don't ridicule it.

195
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
You say now... Stand up.
* (LAUGHING)

196
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.760
There's a camera here somewhere.
* (LAUGHING)

197
00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.360
Hello, Mrs. Tussauds ...
Watch out.

198
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.840
You want to ... Not Mrs. Tu...
Do not make a mockery of it.

199
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.160
What's its name? Pull it
so that I'm standing there.

200
00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.360
Like this.
* Laughter *

201
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.600
No, one arm higher,
so that the people ...

202
00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:36.840
Here on the willy still ...
Make higher.

203
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.800
Like Harald Juhnke.
He must be like that.

204
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.320
Then they pose like this.
"Hey!"

205
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.760
Oh, I'm going like this.

206
00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:49.080
Ms. Tussauds,
I can't imagine,

207
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.760
that I
standing with you as a wax figure.

208
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.800
But he's very good at it.
This is Mr. Krömer, by the way.

209
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:57.280
I'm sure you don't know him...
* Laughter *

210
00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:01.160
But he is quite famous.
They know him in Berlin.

211
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.760
He would like to be a wax figure.

212
00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.920
I don't want to impose myself,
but I was born here.

213
00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.560
Okay. We clear? Yes.

214
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.400
I wouldn't begrudge it to you.
I begrudge you.

215
00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:21.480
Sido, how long have we known each other?
15 years already.

216
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.920
Very long, yes.
I'm getting nostalgic.

217
00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.920
You are from the Märkisches Viertel
and I am from Neukölln and Wedding.

218
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.720
Born in Neukölln
and grew up in Wedding.

219
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:34.880
And you in the Märkisches Viertel.
I was born in Prenzlauer Berg.

220
00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.080
Hold on. Yes?

221
00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:39.520
East Berlin. East Berlin.

222
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:42.680
When?
I was born in 1980.

223
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.080
Ah! Mhm.

224
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.800
There was still
this separation in Germany.

225
00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.080
Are you kidding me?
No.

226
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.840
Unlike you
I lived through the war.

227
00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:57.840
* Laughter *
Spandau against all the others. Yes.

228
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.600
We both experienced the Cold War.

229
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.640
Iron Curtain
between Spandau and the rest of Berlin.

230
00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.720
Raisin bombers came then yes
to Spandau and have ...

231
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.440
And then I was in Wedding.
We gave them stale bread.

232
00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:14.720
They were very happy.
The easterners? No, Spandauers.

233
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.440
Yes, that's not Berlin.

234
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:19.600
Did you know,
that all parts of "Lord of the Rings"

235
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.120
were filmed in Spandau?
Yes, as a Berliner you know that.

236
00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:27.360
The great thing was that they didn't have to
to put makeup on. * Laughter *

237
00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.320
Because of the hospital?
A low-budget production.

238
00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:35.680
That may have cost
cost a penny.

239
00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.800
Once with the camera
in there with the arbors,

240
00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.040
then you have the right faces.

241
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.960
Do you still have friends from the past
from the Märkisches Viertel? No.

242
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.800
No, not anymore.
Neither do I.

243
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.800
I have friends
who no longer live in the neighborhood.

244
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.880
But people,
who still live there ...

245
00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:59.800
When you became famous, there were people standing
people stood in front of the door and said:

246
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.880
"Sido, pleased to meet you!
Can you lend me 1,000 euros?"

247
00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:05.520
I even have letters from that time,

248
00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.320
from one I kissed
I kissed when I was 12 years old.

249
00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.560
She was suddenly in love again.
Kerstin Fleischer.

250
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:13.640
* (LAUGHING)
Do not know what her name was.

251
00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:18.600
I wanted to kiss her
and when I was of kissing age ...

252
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:20.320
When was your kissing age?

253
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.920
28. yes.
* (LAUGHING)

254
00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.000
No, I was 12.

255
00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:28.680
You always had to watch
"Dirty Dancing first. Oh.

256
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.120
Then kiss. And she: "Let me,
I want to watch Dirty Dancing!"

257
00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.000
I hate this movie.

258
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.160
In our neighborhood
we had to watch "Analdin".

259
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320
"The sore bitches," I think.

260
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.320
Analdin? Yes.
* (LAUGHING)

261
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:46.520
"Anal Fighter, The Brown Peril."
Do you know it?

262
00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:49.800
For us, "Dirty Dancing" was ...
I don't know.

263
00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.040
A dance movie.
Was more for dancing, right?

264
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:57.160
But we did not want to dance,
but what Analdin was doing.

265
00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:58.840
* Laughter *

266
00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.240
* Laughter *

267
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.400
Go on.

268
00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.760
Say,
you're really famous.

269
00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:12.040
Can you still
go out the door without a bodyguard,

270
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.920
times in the hardware store or something?
You can do everything.

271
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.720
Do you do that?
The question is: Are you up for it?

272
00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:22.280
Of course, I could go out without,
but... Do you take the subway? No.

273
00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.360
So, as ...

274
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.400
Times as amusement,
because sometimes I say to myself:

275
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.400
"No, I will not let
not be deprived of this freedom.

276
00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.440
I'm riding the subway now."
But I quickly regret it.

277
00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.840
Because everyone is hitting on you?
What do you mean by hitting on... Look at.

278
00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.480
This looking, making me feel..,
that I am not one of them all,

279
00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:48.880
but that I am special.
Do you know what happens?

280
00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:53.680
I've been riding the subway for 40 years,
S-Bahn, streetcar, bus, everything.

281
00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.960
You walk in,
people look at you.

282
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.520
Then you see how they think:
"That can't be Kurt Krömer,

283
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.320
he doesn't ride the subway."
Then you're safe.

284
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.560
Yes, but...
No one ever talks to me.

285
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.280
I have so many features ...
Or that think,

286
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.320
one is a professor from the past
or a math teacher.

287
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.360
You just look like a lot of people.
* (LAUGHING)

288
00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:19.760
If that works out with Madame Tussauds,
I forgive...

289
00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:22.720
You can also
take one from the street ...

290
00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:25.920
Then I forgive you for that.
But that's already nasty.

291
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.320
We are friends, remember that.
I know that.

292
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.040
You can put up with something like that
but sometimes endure.

293
00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.440
We are best friends.
Very good friends, without fun.

294
00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.960
How many times have we
visited each other at home?

295
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.720
Offered it to us many times.
* Laughter *

296
00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.280
For 15 years. Yes.

297
00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:48.480
Always, "Will you come?" "Sure!"
"Will you call?" "Yes, tomorrow!"

298
00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:53.240
We haven't even visited each other.
No, and we live around the corner.

299
00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.360
As the crow flies, maybe 5 km away.
Well, I am old.

300
00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.440
I could send for you.
* (LAUGHING)

301
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:07.360
Let's make a date. Okay, then.
Either at your place or mine.

302
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.480
After all, it's only 5 km.
Yeah, right.

303
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.920
We come back to the MV.

304
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:16.680
You were an enthusiastic MV'ler, weren't you?
Yes. VTR off.

305
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:20.320
It is hushed up,
that such a thing exists.

306
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.120
You drive through here,
everything's green and all.

307
00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.320
The Märkische-Viertel-Gesobau people
are taking care of it.

308
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.520
There are janitors,
who make the lawn beautiful.

309
00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:34.240
But that helps ... You can not
mow the lawn in the apartments.

310
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.200
* Laughter *

311
00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:39.080
Was that from Confucius?
* (LAUGHING)

312
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:42.200
It was Confucius, say it.
I ...

313
00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.960
I don't remember
I don't remember saying that, but... Yes.

314
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.040
I think it's pretty clever.
* Laughter *

315
00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:55.520
Purely metaphorical,
from the metaphor. Clear.

316
00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:00.200
It felt ...
But the way I talk: it makes me sick.

317
00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.120
(imitates slang) "I can't go
into the apartment and vacuum."

318
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.520
Shall we now
NDR talk show now?

319
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:09.880
Uh... Are we getting mad?

320
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.560
No. Are we mobbing?
I say:

321
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.280
You used to wear a mask.

322
00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:20.040
These are facts that every dick
knows for 20 years.

323
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.000
But they act as if they had
the Amber Room.

324
00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.160
"Sido: It's a stage name."

325
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.960
Yes. I understand that...
Do you feel how tired you're getting? Yes.

326
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.800
We don't do that. I have had this
many times in my career.

327
00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.120
I like to expel journalists
out of the room from time to time.

328
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.600
Yes? Have you
ever kicked out? Yes.

329
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.080
I won't even go there in the first place.
Also okay.

330
00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:46.920
Or I agree and say:

331
00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:51.200
"You must come to Hamburg",
but am not in Hamburg at all.

332
00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:53.800
Then they call:
"I'm in the lobby."

333
00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:57.480
"I promised myself.
In Munich! Can you still make it?"

334
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.600
"Yes, I'll be there in two hours."

335
00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.000
Then one has already flown
flown across Germany.

336
00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.320
Is not good for the climate. Yes.

337
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.840
But I think it's okay,
that should be done quietly once in a while.

338
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.160
Let's talk about Aggro Berlin.
You used to be there.

339
00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.160
"Oh yeah.
What is Aggro Berlin?

340
00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.840
Was that an
independent record company from Berlin?

341
00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.720
Oh, they were the first to make
Golden records made?

342
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:25.240
Uh-huh. Doesn't anybody know?"

343
00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:27.440
* Laughter *

344
00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:30.200
I detect a pointed tone there.

345
00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:33.840
That's just it.
"You have a stage name?"

346
00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:36.840
Where are you again?
At Universal.

347
00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.920
Are they criminals? Sure.
* (LAUGHING)

348
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:43.560
No, we leave it in.
You can leave it in.

349
00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.720
I assume that every large
corporation has to walk over corpses.

350
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.880
I think ...
Sure, even with me.

351
00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:55.960
It's already a body,
if you do not

352
00:19:56.120 --> 00:20:00.120
the personal well-being
of your employees.

353
00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.840
It's all about the money.
Of course.

354
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.760
I have a me company
and the basement full of corpses.

355
00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:10.440
It's criminal.
It becomes routine: "Kill him."

356
00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:16.400
Yes, you also have to ...
They should also do something for you.

357
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:21.280
You can even kill one once in a while.
Kill? Of course, sure. All of them.

358
00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.360
Who all?
Many comedians, for example, Say name.

359
00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:28.000
Colleagues. Say names.
You don't talk about the dead.

360
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.120
Say one.
The one I killed?

361
00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.040
No, whom you would have
you would have killed. Oh, there are many.

362
00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.920
One was a guest here. Oh.
* (LAUGHING)

363
00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:39.720
But not Philip.

364
00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.480
I really find Philipp ...
Philip was sweet.

365
00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:46.840
He was pissed,
because I played the age.

366
00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.320
But then he learns
what age racism is.

367
00:20:50.600 --> 00:20:54.280
He didn't understand, but he's
young and stupid. But cute.

368
00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.160
He's got something, doesn't he? Yes.

369
00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.640
I like to look at him.
He stank a little. Really?

370
00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.120
But I do not know,
whether from the mouth or from the pants.

371
00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:06.040
* (LAUGHING)
That was really...

372
00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:10.120
Maybe it's tactics that
they spray themselves with something.

373
00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.120
I don't think they eat anything.
Hedgehog poop or something,

374
00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.040
so that they
the counterpart magically.

375
00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.240
Would you have thought that your
"Assfuck Song" would become an evergreen

376
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.840
like "Hello Again"
by Howard Carpendale?

377
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.960
Yeah. Cool, huh?
That's your evergreen.

378
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:31.120
This is my "Wind of Change."

379
00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.200
* Laughter *

380
00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:38.040
Decide for yourself
whether to cut it out. Leave in.

381
00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.200
When the Scorpions perform ...
Which song do you know?

382
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.440
"Wind of Change. Another one?

383
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.240
The Scorpions could perform
and for two hours... * whistles *

384
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.760
That's all people want to hear.

385
00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.640
When I play a concert,

386
00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.280
I could go "da-da-da, da-da" for two hours
"Da-da-da, da-da" for two hours.

387
00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.240
People would be happy.

388
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.040
It is my "Wind of Change".
Awesome, I'm happy.

389
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.240
* Paper rustles. *

390
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.040
We still want to talk about the other
fat Otto. VTR off.

391
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.520
What about
with the joint from backstage?

392
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.440
The wall is not a good thing and
if you celebrate this fall of the wall,

393
00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.480
you keep reminding us.
Let's forget about it.

394
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:26.560
I feel quite differently. If you grow up
grow up without history ...

395
00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:29.120
When I say:
I don't care about anything,

396
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.280
I am looking now,
where I'm going next ...

397
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:37.440
We should force people
to learn history? No, but ...

398
00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.400
If I'm not interested,
why do I need to know?

399
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:45.280
More directly:
I wouldn't mind,

400
00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:49.440
when once in the life
of a student's life

401
00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.880
the visit
of a concentration camp

402
00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:55.280
is on the timetable.
I think so too.

403
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.880
Yes. What was going on
with the Sun King from Potsdam?

404
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.760
He was stubborn.
* (LAUGHING)

405
00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.760
He was actually a little petulant.

406
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.680
The large land real estate owner,
who owns everything in Potsdam.

407
00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:13.240
On every lantern: "Günther Jauch."
Since then, I've been banned from Potsdam.

408
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.880
Yes? Yes.
What did the man want from you?

409
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:22.200
I think he wanted
that we all feel a little more

410
00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.400
with the history
of this country.

411
00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:29.480
That everyone should do that and
That he is disappointed in people,

412
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.120
who are not familiar with the history
of the country.

413
00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.600
Are you against it? I am familiar
with history.

414
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.520
I am interested in it,
but do not demand it of others.

415
00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:44.480
If he is not interested,
that's okay.

416
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:48.040
I'm not mad at him
if he doesn't know what a concentration camp is.

417
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.600
But you are not
against memory culture?

418
00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.160
What is a culture of remembrance?
Putting up a monument?

419
00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:59.240
No, not in principle, but
I am against imposing it.

420
00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:01.440
That's what he was upset about? Yes.

421
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.560
And because I
did not drink his wine.

422
00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:08.240
Did he promote that one on the talk show?
Sure, it was about that all the time.

423
00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:11.680
"Mmm, who's the wine from?"
Push, don't leave me hanging.

424
00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:13.400
Yes. Cheers.

425
00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.800
About his winery
was much talked about.

426
00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.520
Wine good, wine bad ...

427
00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:21.800
Now you will never again
invited to the celebrity special.

428
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:26.560
I've never been invited there.
I have.

429
00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.920
I thought: No, I'll be eliminated
out of the 10-euro question.

430
00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.640
I Madame Tussauds,
you "Who wants to be a millionaire?"

431
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.680
You have to promise me.
It's settled.

432
00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.200
Otherwise I won't visit you.
* (LAUGHING)

433
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.760
All right.
I will definitely cancel

434
00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:44.480
and say,
Mr. Krömer should please do that.

435
00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:49.040
So, Sido. Let me pull.
No, get under the table.

436
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:52.200
* Laughter *

437
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.840
He turned it on under the table,
I don't know anything about that! Huh?

438
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.600
You are now 39 years old.

439
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.680
40 years,
half of life is over.

440
00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.640
What is ... Cash Review.
What is the résumé?

441
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:09.440
Um...

442
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:15.160
Everything went faster than we had hoped,
is the résumé.

443
00:25:15.360 --> 00:25:20.640
And I can probably start
start my life earlier.

444
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.960
How, that you become a buffer?

445
00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.240
Lifetime ...
Are you already a buffer?

446
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.640
What's a square?
Cottages and such.

447
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:32.360
Is that stuffy?
Do you do a lot in the garden? No.

448
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:36.200
We have a gardener. I do not sit
not sitting there myself with the scissors.

449
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.440
You sit ...
I tell the gardener exactly,

450
00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.200
how I would like the lawn to look.
That's a bit stuffy. Well.

451
00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:44.480
Be happy,
that he does the shit.

452
00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.040
You sit in the Hollywood swing
and say:

453
00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.760
"Cut the grass shorter!"

454
00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:53.920
That's stuffy. I tell him that
the lawn needs special care.

455
00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:55.880
Do you become stuffy?

456
00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:59.360
Do you invite your neighbors
your neighbors, cook something

457
00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:03.200
and then you watch together
ZDF TV garden?

458
00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.640
I wouldn't even find that stuffy.
Sounds full ...

459
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:10.320
I think that's cool.

460
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.920
Yes, Fernsehgarten, when it's on.

461
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:16.400
I like to watch
on Sundays, I have to say.

462
00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.960
I am
a typical TV garden type.

463
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.800
* Laughter *

464
00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:24.800
Kiwi makes it so fun.
Kiwi is the best.

465
00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.960
When nothing else is on,
I like to watch that, too.

466
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.520
Can you still do the rapper story
still do it when you're 80?

467
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:36.000
No.
After all, people grow with you.

468
00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:40.640
How? Rolling Stones-like.
They are also already 95.

469
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:44.280
I ...
Who still listens to Rolling Stones?

470
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:47.360
Doesn't one rather
pity for such a grandfather?

471
00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:52.000
Don't you want to go on stage and rap
to go on stage and rap?

472
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.560
No, not right now.

473
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:59.360
I calculated: When my
youngest child is 18, I will be 53.

474
00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.680
At 18 you can
demand from a child,

475
00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:08.680
that it cooks itself something
and comes to school himself ...

476
00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:13.320
Do you want to use the camera
to make an announcement at home?

477
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.960
They all know that.

478
00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:20.400
When everyone is 18 ...
At 53, Dad and Mom are gone.

479
00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.800
On the yacht,
where the sun shines.

480
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:25.800
And they stay in the house?
I would throw them out.

481
00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:29.080
They can have the house. Yes?
They can have the house.

482
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.680
At 18 then?
But they stay at home today,

483
00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.920
until they are 50 themselves.
* Laughter *

484
00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.080
They wait until the old people die.

485
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:42.160
I am then no longer there
and care very little.

486
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:44.000
They are 18.

487
00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.120
Guys, do this on your own now.
They're all guys. Right.

488
00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.120
I'm relaxed about that.
When you no longer live there,

489
00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:54.520
can I visit the children
visit them anyway? Sure.

490
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:58.680
You won't live there anymore,
