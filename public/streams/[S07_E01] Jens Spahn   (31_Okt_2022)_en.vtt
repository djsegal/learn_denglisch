00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.160
.

2
00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.120
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.400
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.960
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.040
The white cat
jumped off my lap.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.160
That would have been a nice picture.

7
00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.040
Welcome to "Chez Krömer".

8
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.800
My name is Chez Krömer.

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.760
We come to our guest.

10
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.720
Today's guest on "Chez Krömer":
Jens Georg Spahn, 42 years old,

11
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.320
Member of the Bundestag for the CDU,
Deputy parliamentary group chairman

12
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.520
and former Minister of Health.

13
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.400
* clears throat

14
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.080
We're going to switch over.

15
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.000
Mr. Spahn?
Mr. Krömer?

16
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.440
We would start now.
Gladly.

17
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.400
You are no longer a minister.
No, that's right.

18
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.960
Weak guest already once.
Well.

19
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.680
What is your function?
You read that out, didn't you?

20
00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.120
Well, that's not great.

21
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.960
There was not enough for more,
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.440
There was nothing there where you could ...
Well, I'm coming in. - Yes.

23
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.080
Doesn't do any good.

24
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280
* exhales noisily *

25
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.480
So, moin.
Moin.

26
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.520
Hello.
You are taller than me?

27
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.000
Beautiful ... Are they all red?
Nah, only the one is red.

28
00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.640
This one is also red.

29
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.640
Would you like a drink?
With pleasure

30
00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.440
Can you take
take from the refrigerator.

31
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.000
Is there beer in it?
I have to sort for a moment.

32
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.400
Have forgotten,
how the format goes.

33
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.560
What do you take?
I take water, right?

34
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.600
With or without?
Why did you tape it shut?

35
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.240
Well, because of surreptitious advertising.
I see.

36
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.960
Could have been nibbled off.
You are the nibbler, or what?

37
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.400
Yes, beer bottles
I always start to puhlen.

38
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.720
Do you drink?
Beer occasionally?

39
00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.600
A lot, right? - Nope.
Do you have a problem? Nah.

40
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.320
Do you have drug problems?
Nah, not so far anyway.

41
00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.920
I don't know what it will be like afterwards.
What are you doing now?

42
00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.040
Just being a parliamentarian didn't really
not really taxed you in the past.

43
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.320
What are you doing right now?
Right now I'm at the Krömer.

44
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.240
And what else? - And else.
During the day?

45
00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.600
Pfff ...
What do you do for a living?

46
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.240
I am a member of parliament and I try to
to fill it as best I can.

47
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.560
Once as a constituency delegate,

48
00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.560
I have a beautiful constituency
in the Münsterland.

49
00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.000
That's always 5 hours of travel
- Germany is big.

50
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.560
In addition, I take care of
economic and energy policy

51
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.360
- more in criticizing and
showing alternative than deciding.

52
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.480
That's the way it is in the opposition.
Okay.

53
00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.720
Short, concise answers are great.
Was that short enough?

54
00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.680
A little shorter on the next question.
After all, we have several questions.

55
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.800
You just wrote a book: "We
have to forgive Jens Spahn a lot,

56
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:49.720
because during the pandemic period
built a lot of shit"

57
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.880
or what is the title?
Unfortunately, I did not note it.

58
00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.840
Was almost the point.
Something it is also right.

59
00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.240
I have not done everything
right in the pandemic.

60
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.440
But with the forgiveness ...
Not all or everything?

61
00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.240
"Not everything right"
I said.

62
00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.400
I want to ask if you
have not done everything right.

63
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.720
No, I do not think
- I think

64
00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.280
People always say, I believe.
That is not a question of faith.

65
00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.720
This has nothing to do with faith.
Exactly.

66
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.000
How much have you not
done right? 70 %, 80?

67
00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.920
No, already less.
50/50?

68
00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.160
All in all, we got through
through this difficult time,

69
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.040
even if you compare ...
You now or us?

70
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.640
We, us together. - The two of us?
The two of us, too, perhaps.

71
00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.680
But especially we as a society
with each other in a difficult time,

72
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.280
the stress was for many, the
was new for many, was new for all of us.

73
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.760
There you had to decide
in a situation ...

74
00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.640
Yes, okay.
... where we didn't know everything yet.

75
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
That's why I ...
About this in a moment.

76
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.280
You like to have
the very short version.

77
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.280
When you were 15 years old, you realized
that you were gay.

78
00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.160
In an interview
you said at the time:

79
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.680
I realized at the same time that I like
men and the CDU. Crazy, isn't it?

80
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.360
Weren't your parents shocked
when you came out,

81
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.240
that you think the CDU is great?

82
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.160
No.
No?

83
00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.080
No shock moment:
Oh God, the son is miscarried.

84
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.400
They said, "What do you want there?"
That's right.

85
00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.240
What did you say?
That I have fun with it.

86
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.520
That was my hobby.
My brother played soccer.

87
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.360
That was his hobby.
Soccer is not mine.

88
00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.760
I had fun because we were
were with friends.

89
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:33.080
You don't do it alone,
but with friends.

90
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.360
That was a mixture of party and
Politics of course with 16, 17, 18.

91
00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.280
That's why I ended up
I ended up in the Junge Union.

92
00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.840
Mr. Spahn, are you loyal?
Yes. - Yes? - Yes.

93
00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.680
In the last election campaign
in Team Laschet.

94
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.880
In April 2021, however, you are to work with
the former Bild boss Julian Reichelt

95
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:58.840
in the editorial office with pizza and beer
watched the Triell together

96
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.680
and made fun of Laschet
have made fun.

97
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.560
Is that loyal behavior?

98
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.800
You have included an important verb
built in: "shall".

99
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.920
It is claimed that I have,
I think it was in the "Spiegel".

100
00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.520
My experience is:
Not everything in the "Spiegel" is true.

101
00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.720
What is not true?
That you did not eat pizza?

102
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.800
I can describe the evening.

103
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.800
I was, I think,
Picture, picture TV, what's it called?

104
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.800
After all, it changes its name several times.
It was already called Bild-TV back then.

105
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.160
Anyway, there I was,
got half an hour

106
00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.640
again and again
the one question asked:

107
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.840
"Was it right to make Armin Laschet
as a candidate for chancellor?"

108
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.960
I answered this question
again and again with yes

109
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.640
and also gave reasons for this.

110
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.560
When I walked out,
Julian Reichelt said:

111
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:48.040
"Fancy still up there with the beginning
of the Triell?"

112
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.160
I almost said duel.

113
00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.400
I said, "I'm here anyway,
I'll watch."

114
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:55.640
Pizza was also
- the part is right.

115
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.240
We need to get to the point,
was there laughter or not.

116
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.400
Not what tablecloth ...
There was also laughter.

117
00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.000
But I did not laugh
not at Armin Laschet.

118
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.880
Nah.
Hhm.

119
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.680
Hmm.
Well.

120
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:12.880
In the 2017 federal election
you placed ads on Facebook.

121
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.760
The ARD documentary "Infowar on the Net"
revealed,

122
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:19.160
that you are targeting advertising
for AfD sympathizers

123
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.040
between 22 and 48 years
switched. That looked like this:

124
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.120
"Secure external borders
for a secure Europe.

125
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.920
Do you guys feel the same way?"

126
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.200
Yes, I would
still promote it.

127
00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.360
To try, Mr. Krömer,
to convince them,

128
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.560
that there are smart positions
on these issues within the CDU

129
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.800
and convince them to vote
CDU than AfD, I think ...

130
00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.160
Is that what her post said?

131
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:47.800
"Do you agree?"
is exactly that.

132
00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.160
(both) Secure external borders
for a secure Europe.

133
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:54.480
It doesn't say, "Come join us,
we are the better AfD."

134
00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.480
Do you want to be the better AfD?

135
00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.800
My conviction is,
that the majority of Germans

136
00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.360
thinks it is right for the state to
has control over the border

137
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:05.800
and knows who,
why enters Germany.

138
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.600
Explain that to those,
who are not with the AfD.

139
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.480
I do not understand the problem.

140
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.920
Maybe we appreciate things
things differently.

141
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:16.480
That's okay in an open country.
Are we different?

142
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.120
I had to laugh for a moment.

143
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.400
We'll cut that out,
I don't want to make fun of that.

144
00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:25.280
But are we as people
different - that's the impression I have.

145
00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:28.080
Or do we also have
different opinions?

146
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.720
That's different again.

147
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.760
Obviously we have
different opinions here.

148
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.760
I think so too.
That's okay.

149
00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:38.280
As the youngest
directly elected deputy

150
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:40.840
you are now
already 20 years in parliament

151
00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
and were regarded as the CDU's
of the CDU - before Corona.

152
00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:48.280
Is that it for you
or is there still something to come?

153
00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.080
Friedrich Merz wants to
in the next election

154
00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.880
to be elected at the age of 71.

155
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:54.520
What is your plan?
Well.

156
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.440
What trick are you preparing?

157
00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.200
What rabbit
you conjure out of the cylinder.

158
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.520
To get back on the
to the political stage,

159
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.200
I go to "Chez Krömer".

160
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:08.280
Are you building something?
The new start begins today.

161
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.600
Today the new start begins, huh,
Your nose becomes long.

162
00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.240
Hopefully not.

163
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.720
But what are you doing now?
You go on talk shows everywhere,

164
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.520
talk, present:
"The Jens is not so bad.

165
00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:24.160
I'm a good one, like you guys."

166
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.080
I do, I like the people.

167
00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.360
I do opposition politics.

168
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:31.400
Is something back to the roots.

169
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.600
I started once
in the opposition,

170
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.040
did a lot in parliament,
was speaker.

171
00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.760
Now 6, 7 years in the government
Secretary of State and Minister.

172
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.600
Now I return to the work
in the parliament.

173
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:46.440
This also includes discussing
and taking positions.

174
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.960
Many have already forgotten,
You were once the Minister of Health.

175
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.040
Long time ago.
In the middle of the pandemic:

176
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.760
The start of vaccination was slow,
too little testing was done for a long time.

177
00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:59.360
Then the mask affair
in his own party.

178
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.360
Can you say as a conclusion:
"Shit happened"?

179
00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:05.120
Mask affair gone to shit, yes.

180
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.440
Vaccinate and test bottom line well.

181
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:12.120
Looking back for you now?
No, for us.

182
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.240
For all? For both of us?
You'll have to explain.

183
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.360
For 30% of the people out there? 80?

184
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.840
For us,
I mean us Germans first of all.

185
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.640
That's why it went well,
because it has never happened before

186
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.960
in the history of mankind,
that in a pandemic

187
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.160
with a new virus, a vaccine is
is there - developed in Germany.

188
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:34.400
But it was delivered too late.
It had not yet been produced.

189
00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.800
They could not immediately 5 billion ...
But it was announced.

190
00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.160
That's right.
We made it from January to ...

191
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.360
Did you participate
in the development of the vaccine?

192
00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.400
No, but helped,
trying to help. - Filling?

193
00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.520
No, but that there is, for example
a new production facility

194
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:53.160
exists in Marburg.

195
00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:57.080
I helped to ensure that it was quickly
set up and approved.

196
00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.040
But filling I can not.

197
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.440
Then we made it,
from January-June anyone who wants,

198
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.000
to vaccinate in Germany.
I think that's pretty fast.

199
00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.320
But yes, so that you do not say,
he's making everything up,

200
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:13.280
the first 2-3 months were hard,
we had too little vaccine.

201
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:17.240
We were in a wave in January
with high infection rates.

202
00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.400
Those were difficult weeks.

203
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.960
But on balance, did it go well?
I think so.

204
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:28.720
In April 2020, Burda GmbH offered
to the German federal government,

205
00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.840
with the procurement
to help with the purchase of protective masks.

206
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.480
Berlin office manager at Burda was
and is this man. Do you know him?

207
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.600
Yes, he slept tonight
next to me.

208
00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:42.320
Isn't that a funny coincidence?
No.

209
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.960
Yes, I also thought this morning ...

210
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.240
Daniel Funke, this is your husband.
You know each other.

211
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.640
Yes, we know each other.
Isn't that a funny coincidence?

212
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.440
570,000 masks were ordered by your
Ministry finally through Burda.

213
00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.280
What was in it for you?
Annual subscription to "Bunte? How did it come about?

214
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.080
He brings the "Bunte" with him like this.

215
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.680
Independently of this I say,
how it came about.

216
00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.680
I had in February, March 2020,

217
00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:11.240
a circuit with representatives of the
of the German economy.

218
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:15.000
We talked about the situation.
I got the question:

219
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:17.800
"Can we also help
in this crisis?"

220
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.200
I said:
"Well, there are masks missing."

221
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:25.160
Days later, Mr. Kallen,
then head of Burda, called:

222
00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.400
"Mr. Spahn, I think I could
could help to get masks.

223
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.680
We have business in Asia.
Do you want me to try?" - "Yes."

224
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.280
Not your husband called you
from the office: "Gee Jens ...".

225
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:40.480
My husband knew
until the inquiry of the "Spiegel",

226
00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.760
I think it was over 1 year
later, not at all,

227
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.880
that there was a deal between
Ministry of Health and Burda,

228
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.840
because he was not involved.

229
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.520
And Burda sold
these masks at cost price,

230
00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.040
thus without profit,
sold to the federal government.

231
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.360
But smells like lobbying, doesn't it?

232
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.720
Interpret it this way ... I understand,
that there are questions at first.

233
00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.280
Yes, a big question mark.
I'll explain how it was.

234
00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.800
That is the good thing that you
always explain how everything was.

235
00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.360
It's nice that I get
get the chance to explain this.

236
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:17.000
Good, right?
I think it's good.

237
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.680
Are we a good team?!
Actually, yes.

238
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.040
You know a lot about lobbying.

239
00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.960
2006-2010 you were involved in the
lobbying agency "Politas",

240
00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.800
which advises the medical
and pharmaceutical industry.

241
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:34.240
At the same time, you made yourself known as the
of the CDU in the health committee.

242
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.760
for a liberalization
of the pharmacy market.

243
00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:42.200
That was also a coincidence?
No, that was a stupid mistake.

244
00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:44.280
Yes? How did it come about?

245
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.800
Also the story
I can tell.

246
00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.080
A friend of mine started
independently with the "Politas

247
00:12:50.240 --> 00:12:52.480
and needed start-up funding.

248
00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.960
I would have been better
not taken part.

249
00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.080
This created an impression,
which apparently 12 years later

250
00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.720
still accompanied.

251
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.800
Better would have been without.

252
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.840
That one does not do that?
Hm.

253
00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.920
The explanation is shorter.
I thought you liked it short.

254
00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.160
I can explain it longer.
What aspect is missing?

255
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.320
Normally, the revolving door:
first parliamentarian, then lobbyist.

256
00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:18.000
They did that in parallel.

257
00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:20.760
How do you avoid
conflicts of interest?

258
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.360
There was no conflict of interest.
Just friendship? - Yes.

259
00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:28.800
What does friendship mean? Because of
the help with the Politas foundation?

260
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:31.040
That's what I meant by friendship.

261
00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:34.400
There is no conflict of interest
at the site,

262
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.080
that has arisen
or where I do not ...

263
00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:39.680
Conflicts of interests
always exist:

264
00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.360
That's where doctors come in,
Hospitals, others.

265
00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.200
But I took at no point

266
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.640
not to the best of its knowledge and
and conscience this consideration.

267
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.280
I can tell you that
and into the mirror.

268
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.720
You can tell
say to the sea level.

269
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:55.440
The point is,
I can look in the mirror,

270
00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.280
because I know it is?

271
00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.680
Speaking of mirrors,
back to the masks.

272
00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.200
"Der Spiegel"
reported in July 2021,

273
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.600
that your ministry
unusable masks to homeless people

274
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:08.480
and Hartz IV recipients
wanted to give away.

275
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:10.720
Is that where Fynn Kliemann advised you?

276
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:13.120
Who? - Fynn Kliemann.
Don't know him.

277
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:17.600
He also had a mask scandal.
He wanted unusable masks ...

278
00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:21.560
I do not know who that is.
... give away to refugees.

279
00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.560
Irrespective of this, it was
not so in this case either.

280
00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.440
Funny that
everything was always not so.

281
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:33.480
Funny, always "Der Spiegel" ...
Then we have a funny level.

282
00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.120
Everything is always wrong.

283
00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:38.600
Perhaps rbb headlines are
closer to the point.

284
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.520
What do you mean
with rbb headlines?

285
00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:46.320
Rbb-online also has headlines,
like "Spiegel". - Should exist.

286
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.120
I don't know, there's a lot
in a mess. - After all, rbb saves a lot.

287
00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.720
We need money.
Regardless ...

288
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.760
Where were we?

289
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:57.320
Masks that
everything was not so again.

290
00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.400
It was not true.
What? - It wasn't right...

291
00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:02.080
What was the headline?

292
00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.560
That your ministry
unusable masks ...

293
00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:10.440
No unusable masks should be
masks should be given away free of charge.

294
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.600
They were usable masks.

295
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.880
They were not FFP2 masks
according to EU certification.

296
00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:18.560
So not usable.

297
00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:25.040
Nah, we bought in the spring of 2020
almost only masks from China.

298
00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.120
They cannot be
not be EU-certified.

299
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.600
We made a special permit.

300
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:34.120
Almost all countries in the world
bought masks from China,

301
00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.440
which were not certified according to their
were certified.

302
00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.520
It did not go in a hurry.

303
00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:42.440
But I think
there is no country in Europe,

304
00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:46.280
that has had so many TÜV tests
has had done on masks,

305
00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.760
to ensure the quality.

306
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.880
Such masks we wanted to
give away free of charge, but have ...

307
00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.680
Now comes fat Otto.
Now comes fat Otto.

308
00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.800
Decided but then, we give
only FFP2 masks free of charge.

309
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.600
We then gave
FFP2 masks free of charge.

310
00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:08.200
Nevertheless, punctually one day before the
the state elections in Saxony-Anhalt

311
00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:09.840
this heading.

312
00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.120
Hmm, the evil press.
Yes, whoever, but ...

313
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:16.080
Well, "Der Spiegel"
- 2021, I think, even.

314
00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.760
That came, I think,
from a ministry.

315
00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.560
In your book
you write about the mask affair:

316
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.000
"Individual deputies without character
enriched themselves in a shabby way.

317
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:28.440
All of this annoys me very much."
True.

318
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:32.920
Who do you mean? This is
the most exciting part of the book,

319
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.000
but you don't name names.

320
00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.880
But you have pictures with you.

321
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:42.000
That's a coincidence, isn't it?
Absolute coincidence.

322
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.720
Is it shabby?

323
00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:49.320
250,000 euros in his pocket.
into his pocket. - Nikolas Löbel.

324
00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.160
As far as I remember, these were
these were not transactions with the federal government.

325
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.360
Especially shabby were those who
used me for their business.

326
00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.200
That was not the case with him.

327
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.200
Was he there?
Yes, he was there. - Shabby.

328
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.920
Wait,
he also made a mistake.

329
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.240
But I thought that was shabby, yes.

330
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.240
Did not either ...
That's getting more and more.

331
00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.120
All four of them
made a mistake.

332
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:22.080
All four times I do not find
right what they have done.

333
00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:25.480
Alfred "Schäbig" Sauter
e.g. 1.2 million euros.

334
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.800
One of them even used me
and that annoys me especially.

335
00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.760
* Krömer exhales noisily *

336
00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.160
Wouldn't you be annoyed?
I would get so annoyed too.

337
00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.000
I am very annoyed that the
has been lining his own pockets.

338
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.640
Me too.

339
00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.320
I find anyway madness
in retrospect,

340
00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:48.520
what there was in commission payments,
in margins.

341
00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:50.840
We tried,
when we realized it,

342
00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.960
to make the contracts directly with the
Chinese manufacturers to make

343
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.560
and the middlemen
out.

344
00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:01.280
That's all Union, 'eh?
That's true in this case, yes.

345
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.320
That's all Union.
True.

346
00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:11.040
Why are there no characterless
deputies from other parties,

347
00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.120
who enriched themselves shabbily?

348
00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.400
Are they better people

349
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.600
or with you in the ministry
did not get through?

350
00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:23.240
In the end, this is distributed
equally in all parties.

351
00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:26.920
Not all people are good.
Now they are all from the CDU.

352
00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.600
In this case, it is.

353
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:30.240
I also do not want ...

354
00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:34.800
Your question was whether there are - "black
sheep" is no longer allowed to be said -

355
00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:39.280
but whether they exist only in the Union
or also elsewhere.

356
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:42.000
Now you said
"black sheep", never mind.

357
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.680
We are so in the subject. - The
are spread across all parties,

358
00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:48.320
how they are
distributed in society.

359
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.640
But in that case
everyone was with the CDU.

360
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.360
Mr. Krömer, I wanted to put
to put on record. - Are 6 in total.

361
00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.520
Do we record a protocol
of the interrogation? - Please?

362
00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:00.760
You will laugh,
we even record this with cameras

363
00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:02.560
and sound and radiate that.

364
00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.160
Then you can see that. - Really?
Someone should have told me.

365
00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:09.760
Regardless, for the record
and for the broadcast:

366
00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.960
Yes, the four are
all from the Union.

367
00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:15.200
This annoys me
personally particularly,

368
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.320
because they all
in a difficult time of crisis

369
00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.640
the reputation of politics
of politics in the long term.

370
00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.320
Then let's
move on to something nicer.

371
00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.600
Among her hobbies: real estate.

372
00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.880
We researched ...
We show first.

373
00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:34.520
Quite warm here.

374
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.960
We researched:

375
00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.160
The landlord of the apartment,
about which Lindner speaks,

376
00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.280
is called like you - Spahn.
That's right.

377
00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.160
His first name is even Jens.

378
00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.240
Why research,
It was in the Bild newspaper.

379
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.600
We don't read them.
I see. You only read "Spiegel.

380
00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.240
We have 10 classes
all behind us.

381
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:16.360
What do you say to Lindner
speaks disparagingly about the area,

382
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.480
in which he lives?
After all, you bought the apartment

383
00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.000
2016 for several
hundred thousand euros.

384
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.880
Is not shabby now.

385
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.640
But does he express himself deviously
and not good about Schöneberg?

386
00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.800
You think so?
I like Schöneberg.

387
00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.760
Me too, great. One of the
most beautiful districts I know.

388
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.880
In 2018, you bought an apartment in Schöneberg
an apartment for just under 1 million.

389
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:41.880
The previous owner Markus Leyck
Dieken appointed 1 year later

390
00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:44.480
to the top
of the company "Gematik".

391
00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.480
Also a funny coincidence, eh?

392
00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:49.720
I'll explain,
when they give me the chance.

393
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:52.480
Of course,
Mr. Ex-Minister.

394
00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.280
"Gematik" is the company,
that promotes digitization in the ...

395
00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.800
"Old friend"
stands at the Tagesspiegel.

396
00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:00.440
He's not that old yet.

397
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:04.840
But regardless of this
we searched at the "Gematik

398
00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.240
was looking for a new managing director.

399
00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:11.320
The staffing agency made a
search process. There were applications.

400
00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.360
He has won in this selection process
- is that what you call winning?

401
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.560
Anyway, he was the one ...
You suggested him?

402
00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:21.880
No, the personnel agency
personnel agency suggested him.

403
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:24.320
Funny, you sold
the one apartment

404
00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.920
and at the same time he was
proposed at "Gematik"?

405
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.400
Not at the same time.
As you yourself ...

406
00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.840
One day after signing
at the notary?

407
00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.520
As they themselves read out,
it was 1, 2 years later.

408
00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:40.120
That is why one
had little to do with the other.

409
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.320
He even gave up quite
quite a bit of salary from the previous job,

410
00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.160
to get to "Gematik",
because for the topic

411
00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:50.160
"Digitization
in the healthcare sector" is on fire.

412
00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.000
He convinced
especially the personnel agency

413
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.040
and those who represent him
in the shareholders' meeting

414
00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:59.040
to the position of managing director.
So, let's move on.

415
00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:02.640
In October 2020 you bought a villa
a villa with your husband

416
00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:06.640
in the noble Berlin district ...

417
00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.760
Why "..."?

418
00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320
May I say Dahlem?
It was already in the newspaper.

419
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.920
Also in picture? We don't read them
them. Here is the house from you.

420
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.840
You have forgotten the access road
in the photo.

421
00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:22.440
It is an old photo.
You didn't live in it then.

422
00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:24.120
So, pay attention.

423
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.440
If one considers their emoluments
as a member of parliament, federal minister

424
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:31.160
and any additional income
additional income declared by you,

425
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:35.320
we are after 18 years rounded up
at approx. 2.1 million euros gross.

426
00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.600
For the villa
you paid a good 4 million euros.

427
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.880
Makes together with the apartments

428
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:44.320
approx. 5.7 million euros
Expenditure on real estate.

429
00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:48.280
How can you afford real estate
for just under 6 million euros?

430
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.480
I have not yet
yet.

431
00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.880
There on the monitor.
Do you know what I did?

432
00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:58.840
I learned from friends in London
the following clever procedure,

433
00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.680
which leads to
that more people in London

434
00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.640
have property than in Berlin.

435
00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:05.760
Try explaining that to the Berliners,

436
00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.600
how we can all
can buy such a villa.

437
00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.480
There is the simple principle

438
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.440
in the city, where real estate
to start small in value.

439
00:23:14.600 --> 00:23:18.560
My first apartment in Berlin,
which I bought, was relatively small.

440
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.200
To live there,
to pay off, a piece.

441
00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:24.960
When the value has increased,
to sell again.

442
00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.800
It is clear that you have to
you have to take out a loan, you have to pay it off.

443
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:32.880
But with what you earn,
how do you come up with 6 million euros?

444
00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.000
But not 6 million euros.
Do you play the lottery, bingo?

445
00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.400
Do you do house flea market?
The 6 million euros are your bill.

446
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.240
These are 2 apartments in Schöneberg
and the house with 4 mio.

447
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.520
But that's not how it works.

448
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.200
One already cost just under 1,
980,000 plus 4 million

449
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.000
plus the other apartment,

450
00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.120
then we arrive at a total of
just under 6 million euros.

451
00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:57.920
I cannot understand the
not comprehend.

452
00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.280
Or the one apartment
has a value of 10 euros only.

453
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.240
Then we are still
still at 3 million, no at 5.

454
00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:07.840
They assume a
Full financing for all apartments

455
00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.640
and for nothing paid off.

456
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.200
The principle little by little ...

457
00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.840
I am a banker.
I learned in the real estate bank.

458
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.800
In the West Münsterland
in the savings bank. - No.

459
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:20.720
Let me ask you further.

460
00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.320
You can't put something like that
in the room.

461
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.240
It goes on in a moment.
You answer too slowly.

462
00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:27.880
Question - Answer means ...

463
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.200
So that this is not wrong,
that would... That would be wrong.

464
00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.600
My training was
at Westdeutsche Landesbank.

465
00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.200
It would be a pity
if that remained false.

466
00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.960
I then worked
at a real estate bank

467
00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:44.240
and therefore I started
with 20 with real estate financing.

468
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:48.800
According to your own statement
always 5-8 books in parallel.

469
00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.520
What are these? Savings books?

470
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:54.000
Savings accounts soon bring again,
but otherwise no interest,

471
00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.720
I cannot recommend.

472
00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.560
Do we live in Germany
in an envy society?

473
00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:03.360
They have remained with their small arbor
still remained modest.

474
00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.720
You could have afforded much more in the
could have afforded much more in the free economy.

475
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:10.800
Maybe.
But I like doing politics.

476
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.240
But it has to bring something, right?
Nope.

477
00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:15.920
Financially it must
take something off, right?

478
00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.160
It must be adequately paid.

479
00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.080
It is, I think,
for what the job, the task,

480
00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.160
brings with it:
24 hours, 7 days a week.

481
00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:28.840
If you want there
a few more good ones do that, too,

482
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.640
it needs
adequate payment.

483
00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:34.680
That's what we have in Germany.
That's okay, too.

484
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:38.360
I can keep up with public
stations,

485
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:41.960
stand up to comparison,
I think, given what's here

486
00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:44.440
and there is paid so.
Is that too much?

487
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:48.840
The chancellor earns less than
your Intendant, doesn't he? - Intendant.

488
00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.720
Intendant.
Temporary Intendant.

489
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:54.200
Past Intendant
or not?

490
00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.360
Yes, we have
a temporary artistic director.

491
00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:00.920
Mrs. Schlesinger
earned more than the chancellor.

492
00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.040
Is that too much?
Are you jealous? - Nope.

493
00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.920
Do we live in a society of envy?
That is too sweeping for me.

494
00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.600
There are reflexes occasionally.
That is so.

495
00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.720
I am rather pleased
when someone is successful.

496
00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:16.800
But you don't like to talk about
you don't like to talk about.

497
00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:19.920
They won't let me.
When I wanted to say something ...

498
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:24.320
Without the Hamburg Higher Regional Court
we would not be allowed to do that ...

499
00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.800
Speaking of mistakes:
That was a mistake on my part,

500
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.840
that I tried ...
What error again?

501
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.360
I get confused.
I'm directing it right now.

502
00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:38.960
It was a mistake to take legal action
against the reporting.

503
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:41.560
I wanted to
to protect our privacy.

504
00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.320
During the time
I could no longer go out the door

505
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.640
without someone filming
filmed every movement.

506
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.200
I just wanted to protect a last
bit of privacy.

507
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.680
It was wrong in hindsight.

508
00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:58.800
I must as a public person
Reporting overtly

509
00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.680
up to all questions
endure, endure, accept.

510
00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:04.600
That's how it is.
That's how it is.

511
00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.320
But there's a lot of money in it.
That's okay.

512
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.000
That's it, come with me.
That's it?

513
00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.160
Do you have another question?
I will also remain seated.

514
00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.640
Nah, we have to, otherwise they say,

515
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.000
we cut out so much.
Too bad.

516
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.240
I have another gift for you.

517
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.360
Do you close the jacket
here closed or open? - Doesn't matter.

518
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:29.280
We have made a shirt for you
made where all the people ...

519
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.040
We must now
pay legal attention.

520
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.280
Did they sponsor the show?

521
00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.400
These are,
from a purely legal point of view, people,

522
00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:43.320
great people you know.
Move over.

523
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:46.360
Why do I know "Unicredit"?
I do not know.

524
00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:49.040
It is not my size,
I see immediately.

525
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.440
You should have checked beforehand...
Too small or too big?

526
00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.560
... can make clever,
what size I have.

527
00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:57.760
You have a ...
XXL of course.

528
00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:59.400
Nah, you have a 54.

529
00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.400
Nope. - Do you have an XXL?
Do sports.

530
00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.720
I have because of long arm
56 or 106, I think.

531
00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:09.080
I was a men's outfitter.

532
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.720
Do you do sports?
Too little, but sometimes.

533
00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.240
You have muscles around the top.
A little bit, yes.

534
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.600
You pump, 'eh?
You can see that at first glance.

535
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.720
Well, either that's stuffed
or you pump.

536
00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:25.960
Don't know - Do you pump?
Stuffed is not.

537
00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:29.360
I don't want to touch you now.
So, that was Jens Spahn.

538
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.200
Another question? For you it was
too short. - I will be happy to come again.

539
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:36.800
Shall we talk again about
about real estate? - We can.

540
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.360
I thought it was good.
I thought it was good too.

541
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.120
So, Jens Spahn is pumping.

542
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.880
That was the information at the end,
which we will submit later.

543
00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:46.800
Bye.
Bye.

544
00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.400
* Charles Aznavour sets *

545
00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.520
# You are the one for me, for me

546
00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:05.960
# For me, formidable

547
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.280
Shall we go pump something?
Yes.

548
00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:17.640
Do you come through the door
with your broad chest?

549
00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.840
Are we doing another show?
Yes.

550
00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.960
