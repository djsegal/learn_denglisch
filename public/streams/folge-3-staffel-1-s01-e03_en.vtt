00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.680
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.800
Why is he with Vice?

4
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.920
Why not something decent?
Murder, corruption ...

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.280
The Lord Mayor of Cologne
is being blackmailed.

6
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.800
There is a client.
Do you already have a lead?

7
00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.960
Who is that?
That's mom from Wedding.

8
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.320
You have nothing to fear.
No!

9
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.880
What happened?
Can you hear me?

10
00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.200
I'll get help.
 Please.

11
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.960
Let the train pass.
It is traveling on behalf of the Reichswehr.

12
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.960
Someone has to sign the shipping documents
sign off.

13
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.800
This is Major General Seegers.

14
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.960
Alexei Kardakov ...

15
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.800
Hey!

16
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.440
That's my coat!
- Give it to me!

17
00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.920
Ah!

18
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.800
You rat shit!

19
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.800
A security guard, a security guard!
- Stop! Police!

20
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.360
*whistle*

21
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.520
Stay where you are!

22
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.400
*whistles*
Stop immediately! Stop!

23
00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.920
Ah!

24
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280
*He groans.

25
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.200
*Tuten*

26
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.760
*You speak Russian.

27
00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.200
*exciting music*

28
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.520
*squeak*

29
00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.960
*exciting music*

30
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.360
Morning, ladies and gentlemen.

31
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800
How do you do?

32
00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.920
The 10.14 from Leningrad?

33
00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.600
I would like to have
the papers, please.

34
00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.720
A wagon has to be moved.
To continue the journey.

35
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.000
And which wagon is that?
- The last one.

36
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.920
Paris, yes?

37
00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.720
Departure 15.30 hrs, platform 23.

38
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.480
*exciting music*

39
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.120
Is there a problem?

40
00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.760
Hey, tell me...!

41
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.840
(No!

42
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.800
No!

43
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.200
Hold on to him!

44
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.960
Hold it!

45
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.240
Relax, you wild bumblebee.

46
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.320
Leave me alone!

47
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.840
Who is your supervisor?
- He'll come along.

48
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:04.120
*disturbing music*

49
00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.200
*uncanny music

50
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.280
*rhythmic music

51
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.920
You stink.

52
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.520
I've had a bit of bad luck.

53
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.400
*Kardakov groans.
Not broken, lucky.

54
00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:24.440
*Kardakov groans.

55
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.160
*multi-voiced barking*

56
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.520
Where can I find the mom here?

57
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.480
Mom no longer wants to
on the street.

58
00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.920
Now only works from home.

59
00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.480
Costs a fiver.

60
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.680
I'll get two now,
you'll give me three later.

61
00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.560
Second staircase on the left.

62
00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.960
*screak*

63
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:00.360
You have a quarter of an hour.

64
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.240
Then you're at the bottom,
or I'm on top.

65
00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:10.400
*knock*

66
00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.560
*voices in the background

67
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:18.160
Is your mom there?

68
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.800
*voices in the background

69
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.520
Sorry?

70
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.800
Get out, take your sister
right away - and you too!

71
00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.880
Get lost, Eckelt!

72
00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:48.400
Put it down, sit down there!

73
00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.280
I said leave it open!

74
00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.120
Well, let's get those things up!

75
00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.760
Now do it.

76
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.200
Make a fist.

77
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.480
What now?

78
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.400
Why are you coming to mom?

79
00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.160
if you don't want the specialty
don't want the specialty?

80
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.120
Get out of here!

81
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.160
Wait a minute.

82
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.520
So who is that?

83
00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.840
I don't know.

84
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:38.200
Believe,

85
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.720
I remember the food
of all the perverts?

86
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:44.760
Who is the other woman?
Martha Konopatzki.

87
00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.800
But it's back to Pomerania.
Where was the picture taken?

88
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:52.760
I don't know.
Somewhere in the west.

89
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.680
Address?
I don't have one.

90
00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:58.280
They were there.
We were carted there. At night.

91
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.400
They have
a hat in our face.

92
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.680
So that we don't see anything.
 Who?

93
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.320
Sometimes this one, sometimes that one.
I can't tell you either.

94
00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.520
What else can you
else remember?

95
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.480
*She sighs.
Nothing.

96
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:19.200
All right, the red horse.

97
00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.760
It hung on the wall
and was giggling stupidly.

98
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.760
Well, there.

99
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.400
*exciting music*

100
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.120
How are you? All good?
Have a nice day.

101
00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.800
Morning, Mr. Gräf.
- Morning, Jänicke.

102
00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.160
Let me through.

103
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:04.280
Day.
 Day.

104
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:06.280
*murmur of voices*

105
00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.240
Ah, today
the really big line-up.

106
00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.160
Comrades, men:
the chief of police.

107
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.680
(Ho, ho, ho, ho!

108
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:23.680
Greetings, August.

109
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.640
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

110
00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.960
Yes, yes.

111
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.840
Yes yes! That's good. At ease.

112
00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.400
You all know
what it's all about.

113
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.480
On May 1st we are facing
a lot of trouble in the house.

114
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.400
More than a dozen associations
of the Communists have announced,

115
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:48.280
the ban on demonstrations
to disregard the ban on demonstrations.

116
00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:50.160
*excited murmur*

117
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.840
There can be a chain reaction.

118
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.800
We must
resolutely prevent them.

119
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:57.640
*mumble*

120
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.560
Radical forces
have been trying for years,

121
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.720
to undermine our state

122
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.760
and the chaos
into our streets.

123
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.960
But we have
the citizens of our country

124
00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.600
and our democratic constitution
to protect!

125
00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.320
*cheers*

126
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.360
Therefore, firstly:

127
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.840
The existing team density
will be strengthened

128
00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.560
with forces from Spandau
and Zehlendorf.

129
00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:34.280
These are used in
Kreuzberg, Neukölln and Wedding.

130
00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:38.800
That's where our
very special Pappenheimer.

131
00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.520
*laughter*

132
00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:41.440
The operational leaders are:

133
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.720
Reiser.
- Here!

134
00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.560
Blaschewski.
- Here!

135
00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.000
Boglau.
- Here!

136
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.360
And Wolter.

137
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.960
Your equipment
from the armory.

138
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.800
*exciting music*

139
00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.760
Hello, Erwin.
 Mr. Wolter.

140
00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.400
Mauser 98,
100 pieces of ammunition.

141
00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.720
Next.

142
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:09.240
Tell me, Willy: 100 shots?
That's like being at war.

143
00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.920
Would you rather have that one?

144
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.680
MP28, brand new.

145
00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.240
And whether I want them.

146
00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.840
The general is in town.
Wants to talk to you.

147
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.280
*exciting music*

148
00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120
*knock*

149
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.360
No.

150
00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.800
*He groans.

151
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.640
Hello, Inspector Rath.
I need an enlargement.

152
00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:49.280
A really ...
large magnification.

153
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:51.840
Is that possible?
Yes.

154
00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:53.600
From what exactly?

155
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.400
*she sighs.

156
00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:14.840
Ah, here you are.
 Doris.

157
00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.520
I just wanted to say goodbye.
Will you redeem me?

158
00:16:20.120 --> 00:16:21.200
What is it all about?

159
00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:24.400
Synchronize cases,
bring in a system.

160
00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:26.800
They call it
"keyword register".

161
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.360
You've got a goldmine there.
You'll be sitting on it for weeks.

162
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.800
Mhm.

163
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:34.560
But I can't do it.

164
00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:38.600
All day in the cellar hole,
you'll die like a primrose.

165
00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.480
That doesn't bother me.

166
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.840
Then you do it for me.

167
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:48.480
You get 70 pfennigs an hour.

168
00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.880
90.

169
00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.320
80, last offer.
Otherwise I'll do it myself.

170
00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.400
It's a deal.

171
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:01.440
*Someone scrolls.

172
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.520
Good, Mrs. Ritter.

173
00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Ever heard of
heard of French disease?

174
00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.920
Excuse me?
- A bacterial infection,

175
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.840
transmitted
through contact with mucous membranes.

176
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:18.800
Also known as a "hard chancre".
- The rash?

177
00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:19.880
Has nothing to do with it.

178
00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.800
I will prescribe you
an ointment.

179
00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.800
But what do I have then?

180
00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.920
Syphilis.

181
00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:30.760
You've heard of this before
Ms. Ritter, have you?

182
00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.960
Do you have
changing sexual partners?

183
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:41.320
Well, listen!
At my age?

184
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.440
Have you had changing
sexual partners?

185
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.560
In my whole life
only with one.

186
00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:51.920
Maybe because of the animals.
I've been in the slaughterhouse for 30 years.

187
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.480
Now they no longer wanted me.

188
00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.520
Only transmitted by humans.
Affairs?

189
00:17:57.760 --> 00:17:59.240
So, tell me ...

190
00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:03.440
The public health department encourages us
to document all cases.

191
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.840
The state wants to know
what its citizens are up to.

192
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:11.400
So: Any love affairs?
Could be longer ago.

193
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:12.960
(quietly) One.

194
00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.840
*serious, quiet music*

195
00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.240
One is enough. Name?

196
00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:23.760
He's dead.

197
00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:28.440
(Mrs. Ritter) Will it go away?
- No.

198
00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.400
*She coughs.

199
00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:33.280
You should see a doctor,
Mrs. Ritter.

200
00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:36.840
You should keep your mouth shut,
Mrs. Cziczewicz.

201
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.920
(Mrs. Ritter OFF) That one time?

202
00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:45.760
That was over 20 years ago,
It can't be.

203
00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.160
(Doctor OFF)
The latency period can be very long.

204
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.720
20 years, you say?

205
00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.800
There it is.

206
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:01.920
What's going on?
- Mom went to the doctor.

207
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.160
And?

208
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.640
Weeds do not die.

209
00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.200
Now stop it.

210
00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.600
A rash, nothing more.

211
00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:14.920
You have to get an ointment, Püppi.
What exactly did he say?

212
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.680
Who?
 Well, the doctor.

213
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.880
I was at the Völckern!
I've got redness, she says.

214
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:25.360
Because of the germs.
What do I know? Nothing big.

215
00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.440
And now it's over!

216
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.880
But in the humidity at the slaughterhouse

217
00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:32.360
it won't get any
better with you.

218
00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.520
That's why they didn't want me
there any more.

219
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:38.400
I'm going to the slaughterhouse.
Nothing there!

220
00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.600
He should find something.

221
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.520
But not the women's stuff
in the slaughterhouse.

222
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.280
With his paws
he can't pick maggots.

223
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.800
Why doesn't the little one go?
if I can't find anything.

224
00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:53.400
Tell me, are you crazy?
Toni goes to school.

225
00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.240
And that's what we work for.

226
00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.640
Give me a break. I'm still here.
It'll be all right.

227
00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.400
Look at that tramp.
Always a tenner in her pocket.

228
00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.400
Where it always comes from ...
What did you say?

229
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.360
Come on, say it again!

230
00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:14.400
(Lotte!

231
00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.240
First go shopping and then
mark the mimosa, or what?

232
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:21.160
Bring your own money home,

233
00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:24.160
or shut your filthy mouth!
Are you crazy?!

234
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:26.760
Enough now!

235
00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:29.480
I'll beat you to death!

236
00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.760
Son of a bitch!
 Leave her alone!

237
00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.360
Stop it!

238
00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.800
Kiekt doch!

239
00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:40.360
*sob*

240
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.240
*Baby cries.

241
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.840
*He spits.

242
00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:50.920
Dirty women!

243
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:53.160
*Baby cries.

244
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.000
Everyone still together up there?
Your husband is a scoundrel.

245
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.640
So what? I only have one for that.

246
00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.800
*exciting music*

247
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.240
Over there, Café Josty.

248
00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.160
*Honk*

249
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.000
You wait outside
in the car for me.

250
00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:22.880
*exciting music*

251
00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:57.160
Janitor!
I've forgotten the key.

252
00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:00.160
Mr. Kardakov,
you scared me!

253
00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.720
Please come in.
- Thank you.

254
00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.840
*exciting music*

255
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:12.000
Sweta?

256
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.560
*exciting music*

257
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.160
Svetlana?

258
00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.760
*exciting music*

259
00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:07.240
(whispers) "A ...
targeted action ..."

260
00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.160
"... national cause ..."

261
00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:18.840
"Foreign Minister Stresemann".

262
00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.440
So, Jänicke,
off to my place.

263
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.840
*He coughs.

264
00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:25.360
*Sizzle

265
00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.440
*He sighs.

266
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.160
Emmi!

267
00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:53.600
Emmi.

268
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800
(whispers) Emmi.

269
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.720
Oh! Bruno, I ...

270
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.320
Leave it, it's okay.

271
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.600
Get some rest.

272
00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.360
I'll do that.

273
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:26.920
(Ilse, quietly) Lotte.

274
00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.560
(Lotte.

275
00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.480
I used to sit at your bedside.

276
00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.600
And?

277
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.440
But you were different then.

278
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:50.600
Anything else?

279
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.480
We used to be
different with each other.

280
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:56.440
There used to be a time before Erich.

281
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.800
I didn't choose him.

282
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.160
You didn't have to marry
you didn't have to marry that creep.

283
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:04.560
You speak well.

284
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.360
You've just
lucky so far.

285
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.560
I was paying attention, Ilse.

286
00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.680
Take a look at yourself.

287
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:15.360
You're sitting here in the muck,
you put yourself in the hole.

288
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.880
What kind of
you've become.

289
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.240
*exciting music*

290
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:40.760
*You speak Russian.

291
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.640
*Rumbles*

292
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.680
*The floor creaks.

293
00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.680
*scared sound*

294
00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:38.480
*He speaks Russian.

295
00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:41.760
I ... to Kardakov.

296
00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.800
Out!

297
00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.800
*He speaks Russian.
Out, now!

298
00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:47.320
I'll call the police!

299
00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.800
No, no!
- Out!

300
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.120
*He speaks Russian.

301
00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:53.720
Help!
- Shh!

302
00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:55.800
Help!

303
00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.800
(chokes) Help!

304
00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.560
Oh, thank you.

305
00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.520
Already tired?

306
00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:07.240
I can't take any more.

307
00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.320
It was really very good.

308
00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.640
Always cooked well,
my Emmi.

309
00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.120
I have relatives in Cologne.
Oh yeah?

310
00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.480
My cousin
married a publican.

311
00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:22.000
Famous pub,
the "Bier-Esel".

312
00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.160
Oh, really? Thank you.
Mussels and beer.

313
00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.680
My father
used to be a regular there.

314
00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.680
Will be the next police commissioner
of Cologne, his old man.

315
00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.560
If everything goes well.

316
00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:38.960
Are you in steady hands?

317
00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:40.320
Please?

318
00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:41.960
Married.

319
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.120
No.

320
00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.200
Give me a break, Emmi.
He's had a tough day.

321
00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:50.000
Bruno never talks about
about work.

322
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.400
It's better that way, Emmilein.

323
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:55.760
Believe me.

324
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:02.880
Excuse me, please.
I'm going to sleep.

325
00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.160
Many thanks again.

326
00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.160
With pleasure.

327
00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.240
Good night.
 Good night.

328
00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:16.600
Sleep well.
 Yes.

329
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.960
So, my friend ...

330
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.880
Let's get down to brass tacks.

331
00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:35.240
Why did Benda want
to whisper alone with you yesterday?

332
00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.760
What do you mean?
 Well, come on.

333
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.880
I've been around long enough.
So: don't mess around.

334
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.640
What do you want, Bruno?

335
00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.920
I don't want to be the jerk,

336
00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:48.440
who all the time
in the dark.

337
00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.400
I'm not going to tell you.

338
00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.960
All right,
but I'll tell you,

339
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.600
that you have the honor
to accompany me tomorrow morning.

340
00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:00.960
Where to?

341
00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:09.840
Kreuzberg, May 1st.

342
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.720
The Reds want to demonstrate
and we are preventing it.

343
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:15.200
Yes, special offer.

344
00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:19.200
Combing houses,
searching apartments for weapons.

345
00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:22.640
Pure harassment.
Really nice dirty work.

346
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:26.960
But now another shot?
Thanks, it's not compatible.

347
00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.360
With what?

348
00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:30.720
With stupid questions.

349
00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.120
Somebody should
get smart, kid.

350
00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:44.880
*calm, serious piano music

351
00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840
(Dear Helga,

352
00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.600
Thank you for your letter,
which I received yesterday.

353
00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:52.320
It's good to know,

354
00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:54.840
that with you
everything is all right.

355
00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.000
Because here things are
not so simple.

356
00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:00.400
I don't want to worry you,

357
00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.440
but I cannot yet
say reliably,

358
00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.200
when I'm going home.

359
00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:07.560
Unforeseeable incidents

360
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:11.800
have a speedy completion
of my tasks

361
00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:13.240
thwarted for the time being.

362
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:16.720
When I look at the goings-on around me
around me,

363
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.800
then I think of our dreams

364
00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:22.120
and feel
a hitherto unknown hope.

365
00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:25.440
The hope,
that we find a way out

366
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.400
from secrecy,
out of secrecy).

367
00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:31.480
Dancing again today?

368
00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.800
Not today.

369
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.160
Maybe tomorrow. Who knows?

370
00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.920
(Maybe even here in Berlin.

371
00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:46.240
Please think about it.
And say hello to the boy for me.

372
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.000
Greetings from Gereon.)

373
00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:13.200
*Rumbles*

374
00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:16.600
*Rumbles*

375
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360
*She whimpers.

376
00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.760
*incomprehensible sounds

377
00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:28.600
(quietly) It's still there.

378
00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.320
In your room.

379
00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:17.480
What are you doing here?

380
00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.680
*fast music

381
00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:18.400
Help us!

382
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.400
Help!

383
00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.920
Do you want one too?

384
00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:44.480
With pleasure.

385
00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.560
Have you seen this man
seen him before?

386
00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.800
I don't know.

387
00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.280
Maybe he was there once,
when they met here.

388
00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.680
Sorry.

389
00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.920
Who?

390
00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.360
The Russians.

391
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.840
Sometimes there were quite a few.

392
00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:08.000
Then it got loud.

393
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:11.560
Policy. In your room.

394
00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.200
Who lived there
lived in there before me?

395
00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:17.000
Kardakov was his name.

396
00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:21.360
Actually a violinist.

397
00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.920
But when he
has talked himself into a rage ...

398
00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.440
*disturbing music*

399
00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.960
*You speak Russian.

400
00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.960
I didn't understand a word,
but ...

401
00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.400
if he had said
"Jump!" ...

402
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.680
I would have jumped.
He had something like this ...

403
00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.640
Sometimes downright scary.

404
00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.560
The suitcase in my room ...
This is his.

405
00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:53.560
He actually wanted to
pick him up yesterday.

406
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.760
I'll put it in the cellar tomorrow.
Together with that one.

407
00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.360
Where has Kardakov gone?

408
00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:02.600
On tour. Six months.

409
00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.560
With the whole orchestra
on a cruiser.

410
00:36:06.440 --> 00:36:09.440
They drive all the way to the Bosporus,
he said.

411
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.680
Then why did he
his instrument?

412
00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.880
Enigmatic man.

413
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.640
Sometimes he told me.

414
00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.560
He was in the war on the
on the other side of our men.

415
00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.280
How they fell.

416
00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.840
"Like bees in the frost",
he said.

417
00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.600
I had a dream once,

418
00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:40.960
that it was him,
who shot my Helmut.

419
00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.360
And that the good Lord
has sent him to me.

420
00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.280
Nice nonsense.

421
00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.640
Were you in the war?

422
00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:56.400
I went after my brother,
to the front.

423
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.280
And then came back alone.

424
00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.840
Then you know it.

425
00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.160
Wake up in the morning.

426
00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.800
Alone.

427
00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.440
Hate the silence.

428
00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:12.680
The birds too.

429
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:14.960
The whole false peace.

430
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:20.240
My mother
couldn't take it.

431
00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.000
For them
the false son has returned home.

432
00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:36.760
I'll bring the suitcase tomorrow
to the cellar tomorrow, if you don't mind.

433
00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.480
Good night.

434
00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:47.640
Good night.

435
00:37:56.360 --> 00:37:57.760
*A clock is ticking.

436
00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:02.160
*lively piano music

437
00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:08.600
*laughter*

438
00:38:19.880 --> 00:38:20.880
*laughter*

439
00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:23.760
*floating piano music

440
00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:30.760
(Radio) ... Clashes
with the police were reported.

441
00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.280
At the moment, activists of the
of the KPD are distributing leaflets.

442
00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.280
These are claimed,

443
00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.800
the ban on demonstrations
had been lifted.

444
00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:43.560
This
does not correspond to the truth.

445
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:32.120
(radio) ... stronger
from the election campaign,

446
00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:36.240
so that they continue to contribute
for the good of our country.

447
00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:39.840
You are now listening to: Gustav Mahler
from the Rückert Lieder

448
00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.800
and "I am lost to the world
got lost".

449
00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200
*quiet music

450
00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.720
*dramatic singing*

451
00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:14.240
# I am lost to the world
lost to the world,

452
00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:26.520
with whom I otherwise
spoiled a lot of time.

453
00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:38.440
# She hasn't heard from me for so long
nothing from me.

454
00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:12.280
# She may well believe
I have died.

455
00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:37.400
# I don't care at all
about it.

456
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.400
*You speak Russian.
