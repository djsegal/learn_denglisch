00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.280
.

00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.520
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me,

3
00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.080
# for me, formidable.

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.040
# You are my love,
very, very, very veritable. #

5
00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.160
Camera 4 on.
Thank you.

6
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.600
A warm welcome to you.
My name is Kurt Krömer.

7
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.960
(Berlin dialect)
We'll have a look,

8
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.600
what the cat
put in front of the door today.

9
00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.800
Linda Zervakis,
46 years old.

10
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.480
Presenter, news anchor
and podcaster.

11
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.800
Mrs. Zervakis?
Yes.

12
00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.840
It's good to have you here.

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.800
I am happy too.
Great, I am happy.

14
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.400
This is a comeback today.
Yes, it feels like it.

15
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.640
How does the public
legal air feel to you?

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.320
I always freeze,
but not here.

17
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.120
Say,
even if it is not true:

18
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.000
It's like coming home.

19
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.920
It's like coming home.
That came from the heart, thank you.

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.280
I'm coming in now.
With pleasure.

21
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.200
* Linda Zervakis laughs. *

22
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.760
We have all put together,
the whole team.

23
00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.040
With us there is not so much
to eat, but for you.

24
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.440
That's great.

25
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.800
Thank you very much.

26
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.680
A warm welcome,
at home.

27
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.120
That's sweet, thank you.
Can I blow out?

28
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.360
Yes, then you may wish
make a wish.

29
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.360
Do not say out loud,
otherwise it will not come true.

30
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.040
So, now stop with the nonsense.
Do you want something to drink?

31
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.840
Yes, with pleasure.
What do you have there?

32
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.960
We have water and water.
Then I take water.

33
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.880
With or with?
Gladly with.

34
00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.680
Water?
With water.

35
00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.560
With or without?
With. So no without, please.

36
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.560
Water,
no water?

37
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.600
I would like a water,
any kind.

38
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.360
Would you like to have water?
We have only water.

39
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.760
Then I just take the water.

40
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.640
What is this?
Is that fish?

41
00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.760
No.
This is a surprise.

42
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.760
I have a surprise.
Did you bring me something too?

43
00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.120
Yes, but I'll give you
rather afterwards.

44
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.080
I don't know,
how this will be received.

45
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.840
You're now at ProSieben.

46
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.240
You can give me
a suitcase of money.

47
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.320
Are they shitting you with money?
They shit on me...

48
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.600
I'd like it not to be
a gift where you think:

49
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.440
He might like that.
Just give me cash.

50
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.200
That's why. I thought,
that is unsympathetic,

51
00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.720
when I come
with a suitcase full of money.

52
00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.600
If it comes from the heart,
I also accept money.

53
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.160
Maybe backstage still ...
But you have to mean it honestly.

54
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:04.800
Thank you.

55
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.760
This looks like art,
like a vase of flowers.

56
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.040
Many think:
We have taped that off.

57
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.800
So that one does not see,
that it is Apollinaris.

58
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.480
But that is art.
Christo, Christo Edition.

59
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.160
To Christo.

60
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.480
Shall we start with the bad
start with the bad stuff?

61
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.240
Then we have it behind us.

62
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:26.400
Will it also be nice
or just bad?

63
00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.080
Yes. No, first it gets bad
and then nice.

64
00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.840
Yes, that's great.

65
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.160
It depends on
how you behave.

66
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.440
Shall we say that we know each other
know each other, because I duze you.

67
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.520
Yes, with pleasure.
We know each other.

68
00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.560
But one does not know now,
whether good or not good.

69
00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.680
Yes, you did.
You were with me at the hotel.

70
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.120
Now it's out.

71
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.520
It is not a lie.
It was really like that.

72
00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.480
It's not a lie, is it?
You were with me at the hotel.

73
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.240
In Hamburg.
Now it's out.

74
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.600
You asked:
Can you come over?

75
00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.800
I said:
I'll have a look.

76
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.440
Yeah, come on.

77
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.440
With or without touching
was not in the form.

78
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.440
We were in the hotel together, period.
That's right.

79
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.160
That's not a lie, it's true.
That's why we're on a first-name basis.

80
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.160
Are we friends too?

81
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.840
I would like to
like to show off at home.

82
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.880
I think that's great.
Now we come to the show.

83
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.520
It's going like gangbusters.
My new show?

84
00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.520
Yes.
Yes, it goes like this.

85
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.360
So... Yes ...
This is all new.

86
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.400
Even now?

87
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.000
Media professionals say:

88
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.440
Ms. Zervakis,
the quota is modest.

89
00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.720
That's right.
The rate is not so good.

90
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.320
What do we do now?
We have to be patient, that's what we say.

91
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.000
Everyone is still patient,
me too.

92
00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.720
As long as my hair
does not fall out,

93
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.080
that will not happen anytime soon
not happen anytime soon,

94
00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.800
we continue.

95
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.880
We have everything now ...
We have prepared this program.

96
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.080
We said in the newsroom:

97
00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.520
We're making fun of you:
You're on ProSieben.

98
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.480
You are showered with money.
Everything is made of gold.

99
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.200
You are carried in Munich with a sedan chair
carried through the city.

100
00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.880
Everyone throws hearts and flowers.
Everywhere you walk.

101
00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.760
Now the quota sucks.
I can't make any jokes there.

102
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.840
Totally logical,
but it's like this.

103
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.040
I don't want to make fun,
but I don't want to cry either.

104
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.520
Maybe the way in between.

105
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.800
Munich celebrates me.

106
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.720
I arrive,
they go crazy and say:

107
00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.400
What is her name?
Zer..., Zer..., Zervakis, yes!

108
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.360
Don't they know your name?

109
00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.960
Maybe it goes better with German
names work better? They are nice.

110
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.320
Why don't you change your name?
Linda Müller or something.

111
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.720
I think that's mega.
Or Cindy Zervakis.

112
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.440
Yes, Cinda Zarella.

113
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.760
Cinda Zarella, this is awesome.
Image change: Cinda Zarella.

114
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.520
Yes, isn't it?
Hi.

115
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.560
A run on Zarella.
Oh yeah!

116
00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.200
So, watch out.

117
00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.240
That was an ugly start.

118
00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.720
It's like:
You come to a party,

119
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.360
sees a woman and says:
You are ugly.

120
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.280
Then the woman thinks:
This is going to be a stupid evening.

121
00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.120
Then there's a twist.

122
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.800
The woman says:

123
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.080
He is nice,
he has gifts.

124
00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.000
I have gifts for you.

125
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.600
Already?
Take a look around here.

126
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.000
What is different here than usual?

127
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.120
This is a mega-great gift.

128
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.800
It is here in the room.

129
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.400
Is it behind?
It is hidden.

130
00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.240
Is it behind?
Yes.

131
00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.840
Oh no, I suspect something.

132
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:41.480
You didn't organize that?

133
00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.000
Shall I?
I am excited.

134
00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.080
I can guess.
Oh God.

135
00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:50.200
Does it start with "H"?
Yes, the first and the second word.

136
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.120
No, you're not serious.
That's the hot witch.

137
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:58.480
Is that awesome?
Oh my god.

138
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:03.120
Look, here is everything ...
This is how it looked originally with us.

139
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.120
It is the original.
There is no sticker on it.

140
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.000
It's the original thing.

141
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.600
Shall we explain:
What is it all about?

142
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.080
For the people who are not
here at rbb are over 75.

143
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.960
My parents
used to have a kiosk.

144
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.520
You have the cheeseburger
on.

145
00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:28.520
In 2 minutes and 30 seconds
it's ready.

146
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.880
We had
such a device in the kiosk.

147
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.800
So, watch out.

148
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.320
I would have poisoned you,

149
00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:41.840
if I give you hot witch products,
that expired 20 years ago,

150
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.480
would have served.

151
00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.360
That's right.
That's awesome.

152
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.920
Is that cool.
But we have a currywurst.

153
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.960
* Linda Zervakis laughs out loud. *

154
00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.160
If you want to name the name,
then you get money.

155
00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.360
So come on, let's do it now.
I invite you.

156
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:01.920
We organize here today
a candlelight dinner.

157
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.080
Are you happy?
You have to peel off the plastic.

158
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:11.440
Otherwise it will melt, right?
No, here we have curry.

159
00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.840
You have to do that beforehand.
Okay.

160
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.880
Is that how you put it in?
Look, it says it on there.

161
00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.520
Here's a beeper.
Yes. Are you sure?

162
00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.160
Sure.

163
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:25.640
(reads aloud) Before preparation
pierce foil in the microwave.

164
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.120
Oh, all right.
You don't have to be so ...

165
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.720
Sorry.
I'm a professional, right?

166
00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.600
Did you hot witch
stabbed you too?

167
00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:39.320
You do that, it's a nice
anti-aggression program.

168
00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.720
I have it on my face.

169
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.000
That is disgusting.
Horny.

170
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.760
You don't do that.

171
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.440
Is that how you did it in the kiosk?
No.

172
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.440
Wait, coming soon.

173
00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.720
With a lot of love.

174
00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:57.720
Did you take off Pieker and Curry?
Yes.

175
00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.480
Put that in yourself,

176
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:02.080
so I don't get the curry
from getting in my face.

177
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:03.880
So, watch this.
What does it say?

178
00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.720
Yeah, watch it.
Do you remember that off the top of your head?

179
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.520
No,
we had another microwave.

180
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.640
So.

181
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.680
Only one minute and 30 seconds
for both?

182
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.040
And now?

183
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:21.000
Power.

184
00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.680
The first time I did it,
I thought: I'm going to the moon.

185
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.360
Look, it's starting.
It spins.

186
00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.680
Ours has turned.
I do not believe it.

187
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.120
We have
one minute and 30 seconds.

188
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.760
It's deja vu.

189
00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:36.440
Are you vaccinated?
Of course.

190
00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.080
Oh, because I don't ...

191
00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.240
Did you get better products at ProSieben
products than here at rbb?

192
00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:44.240
We all have Sputnik.

193
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:47.760
There they knock out
one after the other.

194
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.840
They always laugh,
because I'm still modest.

195
00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.480
Still not dirty, they always laugh:
Oh, she's so cute.

196
00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.480
She wants to arrive by bike.

197
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.480
You're not a megalomaniac yet?
No.

198
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.640
It's the ratings, isn't it?
Exactly, that's why I'm modest.

199
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.760
You can't go crazy.
I smear curry on my face.

200
00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.080
* Microwave oven rings. *
Ready!

201
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.240
I'm a little excited.

202
00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:23.920
I'm glad it's a water
without jokes, to be honest.

203
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:28.640
So, my darling.
Happy anniversary.

204
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.360
It smells good, doesn't it?

205
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.360
How long
are we married?

206
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.120
For 30 years.
Exactly.

207
00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:40.120
I still visit you
at the hotel. That's exciting, isn't it?

208
00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.360
Look,
I still have this.

209
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:50.360
We're making a lot of money,
because you come from ProSieben.

210
00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.000
Okay.

211
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.200
That was all the confetti
for the New Year's Eve Gala in Cottbus.

212
00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.080
This is made with love.

213
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.640
That's nice.
The curry is still missing.

214
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.800
* Linda Zervakis laughs out loud. *

215
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.440
Such a cowardly thing to do.

216
00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.920
All vegetarians,
please cover your ears.

217
00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.600
Wait, I'll get us the fork yet.

218
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.080
This is the good Turkish ...

219
00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.960
Is there actually
Greek hand water?

220
00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.600
I don't think so.

221
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:21.840
There probably is,
now surely comes the joke:

222
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.680
With ouzo.
Hahaha.

223
00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:27.320
You make jokes like that?
Yes, I make them myself.

224
00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.440
Tell me the three worst
Greek jokes,

225
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.400
so that people know:
You can save them.

226
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.840
I drink ouzo,
what do you do?

227
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.200
Shall we have a Greek barbecue today?
Without coal?

228
00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.360
So, that's all I know.

229
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.440
I light a candle for us.

230
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.400
Into a sausage?
No, we'll do it here.

231
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:52.920
Go ahead, you can do one.
I don't know if I can do them all.

232
00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.560
One I would ...

233
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.320
It's rude
if you don't eat it all.

234
00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.080
Then I am offended.
Lick up with sauce.

235
00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.440
You still need your ...

236
00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.040
Would you mind if I asked
ask questions in between?

237
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.080
No. Would you like me to put curry
over your sausage?

238
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.760
So, pay attention.
Yes, please.

239
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.400
We have something in common.

240
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.480
You know what?
Well?

241
00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.640
Neither of us went to college.

242
00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.160
Nevertheless
we became star journalists.

243
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.920
I'm now on ProSieben,
and you at the public broadcaster.

244
00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.880
Was that a joke?
Referring to me.

245
00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:31.920
Were you making fun of me?

246
00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.640
No.
I'm in the same boat as you.

247
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.960
True,
also in terms of ratings.

248
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:41.160
At 1.2 percent, I have
more than you? Can that be?

249
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.160
I don't know. But you have
views, you're a YouTube star.

250
00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.680
Yes, that's something different.
Sure, I'm a YouTube star.

251
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.120
But here, as far as rbb is concerned.
You're also an ARD Mediatheken star.

252
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.800
But not on television.

253
00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.680
Nobody watches that,
because they're on YouTube.

254
00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.640
So, I'm going to try it now.

255
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.640
Yes, taste it,
please enjoy it.

256
00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:07.640
It tastes just as good as before.

257
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.440
Really.

258
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.280
I think it's disgusting,
I must say.

259
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.200
It smells,
but it does not taste bad.

260
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.120
Or?

261
00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:26.040
I think it's because of the
microwave, the constellation.

262
00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.160
Is this a microwave?
It is a normal microwave oven.

263
00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.600
It was just so beautifully pasted.

264
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.160
You've left ARD.
Why?

265
00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:39.440
Did they just offer you junk,
or what was going on?

266
00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.440
Tacheles!
With Cindy Zarella.

267
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.520
I was very happy
at the daytime news.

268
00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:49.120
But I wanted to do
to do a little bit more.

269
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:52.280
* Kurt Krömer reads the text. *

270
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:57.280
Exactly, that's how it was.
You always came up with ideas.

271
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.960
But then they said:
No, that's too delicate for us.

272
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:05.640
For example, the podcast
that I do: Good Germans.

273
00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.840
I talk
with prominent people,

274
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.640
who have a migration background
have.

275
00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.320
That's what I told the NDR ...
I am a quarter Czech.

276
00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.520
That's why.
Can I join in.

277
00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.480
I would suggest you.

278
00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.080
I am not German,
I am Czech.

279
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:24.160
You can see it.
You can see it, can't you?

280
00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.440
This is real here.
What?

281
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.440
That one.
What?

282
00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:30.080
Your chest hair.

283
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.520
Only Czechs have that?
Turks have that too.

284
00:14:33.680 --> 00:14:38.520
They are not only hairy here.
I am a quarter Czech.

285
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.600
So I'm joining in now.
A warm welcome to you.

286
00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:46.040
So, yes, or was that already ...
No, finish it.

287
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:51.560
You always have this feeling,
in the end it's going to be Jörg Pilawa.

288
00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.720
That is,
because ARD has no women.

289
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:58.640
Who said that? Herres?
Yes.

290
00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:02.680
Herres also said that,
why the women are running away?

291
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:06.280
There is no longer a woman.
No, that one is no longer there either.

292
00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:09.080
That is why he
probably said it.

293
00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.760
Will I get in trouble if I
against the head of ARD?

294
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.480
Now there is a boss.

295
00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:16.240
I see.
The one in Munich.

296
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:20.320
So there are women on television.
Now that Herres is gone.

297
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.320
Now they all may.

298
00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.040
You host the show "Zervakis & Opdenhövel
the show "Zervakis &amp; Opdenhövel".

299
00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.800
Yes.

300
00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.360
We have exclusive material.
That has not been aired yet.

301
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:36.440
From you and Mr. Opdenhövel.
Oh, shit.

302
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:38.200
Sample off.

303
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.960
Oh, no.

304
00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:48.200
We need more, about 50,
but all white, no color.

305
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:51.240
What feast do we have?
Easter.

306
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:54.280
That's later than ours.
Yes.

307
00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:56.880
Make ... Bread, which means,

308
00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:00.400
that the blood of ...
has remained red again.

309
00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.640
That's whack.

310
00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.360
From the hairstyle you know,

311
00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.240
what a shitty school time
I had.

312
00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:22.600
Do you work at ProSieben
with other filters?

313
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:26.680
Yes, this Juno filter,
which is also available on Instagram.

314
00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.360
Have you seen this before?
Yes.

315
00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:33.280
Do you know how the show ...
Did you know that it exists?

316
00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.160
This is what ZDF shot.

317
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:38.600
And attention: It was
shot in the 80s.

318
00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.760
The title of this program was:

319
00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:43.920
Celebrate
with foreign fellow citizens.

320
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:45.920
Greek Easter.

321
00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.000
Then came the Greek Easter.

322
00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:52.760
Before that was "Celebrating
with foreign fellow citizens".

323
00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.280
That sounds like,
like a visit from aliens.

324
00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.000
It's like standing in a cornfield
and says:

325
00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.800
Now come
the foreign fellow citizens.

326
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.480
Celebration is a must.

327
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:07.280
People put things out because
the foreign fellow citizens come.

328
00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.200
Have you seen the blouse?
I have seen everything.

329
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.200
This is a YouTube format.

330
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:14.840
The film is now
forever on the Internet.

331
00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.760
Finally.

332
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:21.120
The clothes,
that is also important.

333
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.200
Are you allowed to keep the clothes
at ProSieben?

334
00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:30.320
Or is that just borrowed?
Like with Ms. Reschke, for example.

335
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.240
I see.

336
00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:38.080
There you go,
and then she buys ...

337
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:42.320
You want me to tell you something...
These are your shoes.

338
00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.040
Yes.

339
00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.400
And Pinar Atalay's pants.
Yes.

340
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:48.200
Was it always like this?

341
00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.200
Did you always wear other people's
You always wore other people's clothes?

342
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.240
No, I had my own.

343
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.840
But I have been told
that when I left,

344
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.160
that they stood there like vultures.

345
00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:03.160
Since then my clothes
the others.

346
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.480
Unfortunately, it will now be
really hard again.

347
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.120
After the hairstyle from the eighties.
even harder.

348
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.880
This is an investigative format.

349
00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:16.360
Then only,
what is his name ...

350
00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:20.280
Carlo von Tiedemann
jumps right out of the freezer.

351
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.760
It's under the table.

352
00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.280
We did some hard-hitting research.

353
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:29.200
I hope that we will nevertheless
remain in contact.

354
00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:32.080
I'm going to give you,
journalistically speaking,

355
00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:34.320
tear the mask off your face.

356
00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.360
Now you're still laughing.
It's about the triell.

357
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.960
You moderated that.

358
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.240
You surprised people
with a comic book.

359
00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.040
Yes.

360
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.560
* Linda Zervakis laughs. *

361
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.240
This.
Yes.

362
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:54.680
What was it about?
It's about the rainforest.

363
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.120
About the deforestation of the rainforest.
And that the ...

364
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.320
12.08.1993.

365
00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.920
That has 4 euros ...
3,90 Euro.

366
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.280
The deforestation of the rainforest
has to do with climate change.

367
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.400
I showed this to Mr. Laschet.

368
00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.080
I asked him if the CDU
didn't read any Mickey Mouse magazines.

369
00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.760
So, now the balloon pops.
Oh shit.

370
00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.720
We researched.

371
00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:25.640
We have been
prepared for weeks.

372
00:19:25.800 --> 00:19:27.720
Achim Laschet jumps in now.

373
00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.640
Camera on Ms. Zervakis,
very close up.

374
00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:37.760
We have a booklet dated 11/14/1991.

375
00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.480
Mickey Mouse readers
save the tropical forest.

376
00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:46.000
That was incorrect research, Linda.
But it is after that.

377
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:47.520
After that it is correct.

378
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:51.400
Laschet would now certainly be
Chancellor with 70 percent.

379
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.760
The rbb. We are
with the public broadcasters.

380
00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.600
You have almost destroyed a life
almost destroyed a life.

381
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:02.720
Excuse me, but he has
deserved it no other way.

382
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.240
Sorry. He also told me
that Klaus Töpfer had done a lot.

383
00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:10.840
Klaus Töpfer has done a great deal
done for all involved.

384
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.280
Jesus.
Do we have another candle?

385
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.360
Fallen over like Armin Laschet.

386
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:20.240
Great.
Now it's a little fun.

387
00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.720
So.

388
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.800
What is it,
if it doesn't work out at ProSieben?

389
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.920
What is the plan B?
Then Späti in the Schanze.

390
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.000
Would you do that?
That is, if nothing else works.

391
00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.880
Is that just a saying?

392
00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.880
And actually you have
not yet dealt with it?

393
00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.640
No.

394
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.920
Or are you hoping so that you don't have to
the Späti have to make.

395
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:51.800
Exactly, that is the hope.

396
00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.800
But I'm a late bloomer.
Late bloomer.

397
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.880
Cut.
We cut that out.

398
00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.600
That was so investigative.

399
00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:07.400
I have everything ruined by such a stupid
I ruined everything.

400
00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.800
Can we do it again.
We take a break.

401
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.400
The confetti must be sucked away.
Okay.

402
00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.840
Hello!

403
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.480
With the Späti it is so ...
Exactly.

404
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.880
Are you a late bloomer?
Also.

405
00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.640
* Linda Zervakis laughs. *

406
00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.520
Again, I found out something
that no one knew before me.

407
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.280
Sometimes I am enthusiastic
with myself.

408
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:33.520
That was a question,
you couldn't have known.

409
00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:37.000
Is that common ground again
between us again?

410
00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:40.120
Late bloomer?
I think I was a late bloomer, too.

411
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.680
In which area?

412
00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.520
With me boys.
With you, too ... or women.

413
00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:49.160
Boys too. I was with a boy for 20 years
with a boy,

414
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.600
until I realized,
I like women.

415
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.600
That was the late-blooming thing for me.
Okay, good.

416
00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:58.240
When did you have sex for the first time?
That's what it came down to.

417
00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.440
I am Greek.
Say that.

418
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:03.880
We count to three,
and then everyone says the age.

419
00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.960
One, two, three:

420
00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.800
19.
29.

421
00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.960
How?
28. did you understand 29?

422
00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:13.120
21.
So yesterday.

423
00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.760
45.

424
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.760
I have never seen anyone ...

425
00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.240
Is it allowed to say something like that on ARD?

426
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.760
I am not ARD,
I am rbb.

427
00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.440
Doesn't belong to it anymore.
No, they don't get anything out of it.

428
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.560
I think the ARD does not know
that I exist.

429
00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:38.240
They are not interested in
for the third programs.

430
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:40.000
What can we do?

431
00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.880
I can introduce myself
at ARD as a newcomer.

432
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:45.200
They would say:
We don't know you.

433
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.120
I could sell them
sell them a different format.

434
00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.360
Will you be a star on Funk then?
That's going pretty well.

435
00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:57.320
Good. Didn't you like it?
Yes, I'm still eating.

436
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.920
That gives bad weather tomorrow.
I eat still further.

437
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:04.080
Okay, it was nice.
Unfortunately, it's already over.

438
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.160
You're not serious?
Yes, I am.

439
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.440
Now I go
out with a sausage taste?

440
00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.120
I also still eat sausage.
All right.

441
00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.120
I was very pleased.

442
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.240
I'll confess something else to you:
I was very excited.

443
00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:20.400
Was that you?
Yes.

444
00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.560
I am afraid
because I think

445
00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.360
people come and they are afraid.
We know each other.

446
00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:28.520
Yes, that's true about the hotel.
Nevertheless.

447
00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.320
What did you expect,
what happens?

448
00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.720
I have respect for you.

449
00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.840
I would be afraid
when I'm on a talk show,

450
00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.240
and the presenter says:
We have sex tapes of you.

451
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:43.200
They were shooting porn.
Then I would think:

452
00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:45.560
I would not like
I wouldn't like to look at that.

453
00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.000
Yes.
What are you afraid of?

454
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.360
That I am not funny
and bubbly.

455
00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:52.520
Or for example
with the Greeks.

456
00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:54.640
I put out two jokes for myself.

457
00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.160
I suspected,
that today I still have Greeks...

458
00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:00.040
I don't make Greek jokes.

459
00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.520
No. Super.
That's why I made these today.

460
00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:06.280
Yes, and now?

461
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.520
We meet again at the hotel.
I ask ProSieben about ...

462
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.000
Yes, ask.
Just ask.

463
00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:15.560
Okay.
I'll give you the money afterwards.

464
00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:18.120
Exactly.
Behind the scenes.

465
00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:20.680
I would have
strong interest in it.

466
00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:22.520
I would do anything.

467
00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:25.520
The only condition is:
Joko and Klaas have to get out.

468
00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.320
Yes.
Yes?

469
00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.120
They annoy everyone, they will
ProSieben people annoy them too, right?

470
00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:35.800
They are at an age
where they could switch to ARD.

471
00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:37.720
They're approaching 60.

472
00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:40.680
They could do
a kindergarten show.

473
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.240
Exactly.
Or what does Stefan Mross do?

474
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.000
Does he still do that on Sundays ...?
The trailer ran before the daytime news:

475
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.440
Sundays again and again?
Yes, I think that's the name of it.

476
00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.880
Oh, well, if you want,
you can...

477
00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.080
We wanted to close the circle.

478
00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.600
Shall I put in a good word
for you

479
00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:02.840
at the public broadcasters?

480
00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.400
Watch out,
this is a transfer trade.

481
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.160
I go to ProSieben,
and you come back.

482
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:10.960
Where are you going?

483
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:13.400
Would you?
Now let's get serious.

484
00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.320
Would you consider,

485
00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:19.480
come back at some point
to the public broadcasters?

486
00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:22.280
Or did you slam the door
and said:

487
00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:26.240
Fuck you, I'm on ProSieben.
No, I didn't.

488
00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.520
That people say, we remember,
how she said goodbye.

489
00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:33.080
No,
it was a relaxed farewell.

490
00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:35.320
I have explained
why I am leaving.

491
00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.680
They didn't offer you anything.
Yes.

492
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.800
I needed a playground.

493
00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:44.200
The playground I had,
at some point I no longer had.

494
00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.640
I thought I had to ...
Fuck you!

495
00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.520
Yes, a little bit.

496
00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:51.480
You said fuck you!
No, I said...

497
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:54.560
Cut out again.
She said: Fuck you.

498
00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:58.200
She wonders,
that she doesn't get any more requests.

499
00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:00.600
That's no way to behave.
Good.

500
00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.600
In Greece it is,
like with Malacca.

501
00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:07.560
That means wanker.
You say Malacca, good friend, like this.

502
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.760
I went to the cinema to see the movie
with the Greek gods.

503
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.800
What was it called?
Clash of the Titans?

504
00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.520
I was alone in the cinema.

505
00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.240
Three Greeks were sitting in front of me,
all three seconds "Malacca".

506
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:23.760
The movie sucked,
but the three Greeks...

507
00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.080
Are we going now?
We're going now. To the hotel.

508
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.320
It was worth it after all.

509
00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.160
Wait, I still have ...

510
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.360
There?
Yes, be careful.

511
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:43.880
There is a partition because of Corona.

512
00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:47.320
Can you go around?
There is the window.

513
00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:49.640
Thank you.

514
00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.400
We are holding a press conference.

515
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:58.560
We're recording that you're back
with the public broadcasters.

516
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.160
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Cindy Zarella is back.

517
00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:05.160
First at HR,
to see how it works there.

518
00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:07.840
Then you come
in again via the rbb.

519
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.320
Perhaps also back on ARD.
One thing is important:

520
00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:15.080
There are two points to keep in mind.
The party is always right.

521
00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:18.720
And Judith Rakers
always has priority.

522
00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.560
Okay, but...
You get an offer.

523
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.400
If Ms. Rakers rejects it,
it goes on to you.

524
00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:28.240
Okay.
Anything else you want me to say?

525
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.760
At the end in every show,
you do, always say:

526
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:34.360
Thank you Kurt Krömer.
Okay, we can do that ...

527
00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:37.920
Yes?
The kind-hearted Mr. Kurt Krömer.

528
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.880
Yes, and good-looking.
Okay.

529
00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.040
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
That was nice. So, press.

530
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.240
I wasn't looking.
Never mind.

531
00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:51.600
Can you say that again?
We'll cut that to the beginning.

532
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.520
Or at the end,
as a seal.

533
00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.920
What was on the day's news
at the end? Bye-bye Nikowski.

534
00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:01.240
What did you say?
Would you like to have said that?

535
00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.400
Bye-bye kowski?
Yes, like this: Okay guys, dig in.

536
00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.280
Skin pure?
Yes.

537
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.560
No, then you want to look cool,
that doesn't fit.

538
00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.560
Has anyone ever
in the history of the Tagesschau

539
00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:15.640
gone completely crazy?
No.

540
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.320
That's the weird thing:
You have the power.

541
00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.120
You have fifteen minutes live.
To take over the world.

542
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.120
But you don't dare.

543
00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.840
That's why:

544
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.080
Good evening,
Ladies and gentlemen.

545
00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:30.600
Now the weather forecast
for tomorrow.

546
00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:33.320
Who made the weather?
What was it always?

547
00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:37.160
When we're done now?
Then I'll do the daily news.

548
00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.960
I wish you ...

549
00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:41.800
Caren Miosga has
the following daily topics for you.

550
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.240
I wish you
a nice evening.

551
00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.160
Bye-bye Nikowski.
Dig in.

553
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:04.000
# You are the one, for me,
for me, for me, formidable.

554
00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.240
# You are my love, very ... #
