00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.440
*Music*
Charles Aznavour: For me formidable

3
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.400
Moin.

4
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.360
So, let's see,

5
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.320
what the cat has
put in front of the door today.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.320
Frauke Petry, 45 years,
Non-attached deputy

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.720
of the German Bundestag,
former federal spokeswoman of the AfD.

8
00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.000
Ms. Petry, you are in place?

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.880
Yes, Mr. KrÃ¶mer.
But not you yet.

10
00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.840
*exhales heavily*

11
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.360
So. Good day.
Good day.

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.760
Mrs. Petry, the big question,
we have all asked ourselves:

13
00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.120
Why did you accept the invitation
accepted at all?

14
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.400
You should know that
know much better, I think.

15
00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.920
Why? I don't know.
You really don't?

16
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.040
We all have
big question marks over our heads.

17
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.040
We are preparing for a
very sad show today.

18
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.400
We can do better than that.
You do have a tip.

19
00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.040
They were insolvent,
failed with the AfD,

20
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.240
with the Blue Party failed.

21
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.840
But you have
got a tip from the colleague

22
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.800
and the AfD party conference is coming up soon.

23
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.240
Which tip? Which colleague?
No idea.

24
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.200
But one tip
you have received.

25
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.000
How, that you failed?

26
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.960
We can talk about that,
what you mean by that.

27
00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.600
Personal insolvency.
I'll repeat that again.

28
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.720
Perhaps you have not understood
not understood through the window.

29
00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.520
Private insolvency filed,
failed with the AfD,

30
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.200
Blue Party failed.

31
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.240
No matter what you say politically,
no one cares.

32
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.280
Well.
No more. Not anymore.

33
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.160
But that's not bad,
you know? It was back then.

34
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.960
People cared then,
now they don't.

35
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.360
But you are obviously interested,
otherwise I wouldn't be here.

36
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.400
Yes, you know, we are here
quasi the clarifier

37
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.720
of the public
television.

38
00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.760
Here the shit is delivered
and we then try

39
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.480
to make clear water out of it.

40
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.600
You poor thing can not decide
who comes and who does not.

41
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.800
We can't get clear water
we probably do not get

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.840
but maybe water
to wash your feet. Yes, something too.

43
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.840
Advice can no longer be given to you
now also no longer give,

44
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.600
because it is over.

45
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.320
You don't like advice
not so fond of advice either, are you?

46
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.680
You are welcome to give it to me. With me
that could still bring something.

47
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.400
It's not like I'm at the end.

48
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.040
That is always a matter
of perspective.

49
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.880
I feel pretty good about it.

50
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.080
But their lives are like the Titanic:

51
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.720
The ship goes down
and you know the Titanic.

52
00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.920
This is a ship,
a mega-ship is going down.

53
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.080
But in your life there are
Part 2, Part 3, Part 4.

54
00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.320
Again and again
a submarine, a boat and bang,

55
00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.920
it goes down again.

56
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.960
Have you been rehearsing for weeks now
to practice to accommodate that?

57
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.640
Yes, because it is.

58
00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.880
Well, but there you can
something even better, right?

59
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.360
No, for me that is
the great tragedy.

60
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.840
But if you're interested,
I have a book coming out soon,

61
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.120
that you can read
and then understand it better.

62
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.440
That's why you're there: book publicity.
Right. What's the name of the book?

63
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.880
I won't tell you yet, otherwise
some people in the AfD will be unsettled.

64
00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.600
But it comes out at the end of May and then
you might find the answer there.

65
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.480
You are at rbb!
Not on ARD.

66
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.440
It's no longer enough for ARD either.

67
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.920
They all belong together.
It would be nice if things were different.

68
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.040
But it's not enough for ARD
for the ARD. That doesn't matter.

69
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.120
It's so nice not to have to
on a talk show all the time?

70
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.800
Wonderful! Yes? Yes.

71
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.320
Do you think that's great, three guests
a week, seasons over and over again?

72
00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.720
I think it's cool.
That's where we differ.

73
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.200
I get a lot of requests
and simply cancel,

74
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.400
when I'm not in the mood,
that's cool.

75
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.040
Well, you see.
Which talk show will you be on tomorrow?

76
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.720
At home with my kids,
that's so much better.

77
00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.920
Recent headline from you:

78
00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.440
Donations scandal at the AfD.
They spill the beans.

79
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.640
Real estate billionaire
Henning Conle..

80
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.720
Is his name Cohnle or Conle?
Doesn't matter, does it?

81
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.360
This is another question that I
not get answered properly.

82
00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.080
Yes, but that doesn't matter.

83
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.520
You have obviously
written it down correctly.

84
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.240
Anyway. I have so many questions.

85
00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.960
The billionaire Henning Conle is said to be
to the AfD politicians Weidel and Meuten

86
00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.960
illegally have given large donations.

87
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.400
And you had your first contact with Conle
for the first time. Hmm.

88
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.080
Why did you
not said at the time:

89
00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:37.000
There are some things that seem strange to me?
When was the meeting? 2015? Hmm.

90
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.560
Why do you think of this now?

91
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.160
Well, sometimes you think
a while,

92
00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.760
until you put things
into the public domain.

93
00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.680
Sometimes it takes a while
to make connections...

94
00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.240
6 years? Leave it,
You want the answer.

95
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.000
You are already interested in
what's going on with the AfD.

96
00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.440
Because you certainly don't like them,
just as little as I do by now.

97
00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.680
You don't like them either.
Oh, that's right.

98
00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.240
Well, when a
party leader resigns,

99
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.480
then there is already
a reason to go.

100
00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.280
But how do you know,
that I don't like the AfD?

101
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.480
I am a neutral journalist.
Totally.

102
00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.600
But to recap:
Your house is on fire

103
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.160
and 6 years later
call the fire department.

104
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.520
That's how it was.
No, that's not true.

105
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.240
Any party, especially one,
that has been founded relatively recently,

106
00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.920
needs money.

107
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.960
And if you are offered
is offered,

108
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.520
listen to offers
first of all.

109
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.920
There were many conversations from people
who wanted to donate

110
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.960
and as a party leader
you talk to the people.

111
00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.760
How and whether people really donate
is usually a long process.

112
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.760
After all, you have spoken several times.

113
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:46.560
And in the course of a certain time
it turned out for me,

114
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:50.000
that it is not, and I
have expressed that.

115
00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.480
No one is going to come and leave
the suitcase of money in front of your door.

116
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.400
You would reject it in any case
reject it. And so would I.

117
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:59.920
I would accept it, but I am
not a politician. You see.

118
00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.320
But didn't you even ask Meuten
asked what came out?

119
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.480
He had met a few times.
met a few times.

120
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.560
Did you not notice
that the next day

121
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.880
wore a white suit
and gold shoes?

122
00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.440
Doesn't that make you wonder how
what happened to the conle?

123
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.520
You have obviously seen the program
seen on "Frontal 21

124
00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.760
and have heard
what I said.

125
00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.720
There was a joint meeting and
I gave information about that.

126
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.200
Otherwise it comes
always comes out well in politics,

127
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.520
if you don't speculate all the time,
just

128
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.160
when it comes to the interests of third
that is done far too often.

129
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.560
I have said what I know.
I said it late, that's right.

130
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:37.240
A little too late, isn't it?

131
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.560
Really? I don't think so,
that it was too late.

132
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.240
This unfolds its effect
even in retrospect.

133
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.720
Strangely enough, even after
Exit, where everything was already over,

134
00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.200
where you already knew that the AfD
is no longer of any use to you anyway.

135
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.520
Why did you throw
throwing shit?

136
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.680
There is never the right time.

137
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.800
There are those,
who say...

138
00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.480
You can decide
which group you belong to:

139
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.160
It was much too late,

140
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.320
There are those who still tell me
still say it was much too early.

141
00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.800
And what is actually
interesting financial network

142
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.000
hangs in the background,
has not been clarified to this day.

143
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.160
Many of your journalist colleagues
have pointed out to me

144
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.920
long after I left the
addressed by the AfD.

145
00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.520
I also learned some things
from them,

146
00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.560
which I did not know before.

147
00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.560
We should not pretend
as if it were so simple.

148
00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:27.480
How long did it take the CDU to
to come to terms with its donations scandal?

149
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.160
This is not about the CDU now. One
can certainly guess a lot. True.

150
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:33.520
They are now throwing shit,
a little late,

151
00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.480
but still in time before the election
in the fall, right?

152
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.480
Let's take a look at the short intervals at which
elections are held now?

153
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:44.040
Let's move on to the next question.
No, let me finish.

154
00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:47.120
The Swiss advertising agency Goal AG
shall 2016

155
00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.080
36,000 euros to a certain
Mr. Pretzell.

156
00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:54.040
Isn't your husband
not also Pretzell?

157
00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.680
My husband's name is Marcus Pretzell, yes.

158
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.640
Is this the same or
is it the same?

159
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.560
The same one, right?
When we get right down to it.

160
00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:05.320
The federal administration
sees this money

161
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:07.120
as an illegal party donation to

162
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.920
and has assessed a fine
of 108,000 euros.

163
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.560
And now the AfD must
pay fine for your man

164
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.960
and suddenly you unpack.

165
00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.880
What was going on?

166
00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.200
I think you need to finish
research, because...

167
00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.080
What have I done
now done wrong again?

168
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:26.800
Nothing, you just
just didn't finish it.

169
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.520
It is controversial and there are
good reasons to assume,

170
00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.400
that it was not a party donation.

171
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.640
Your husband has accepted illegal donations
accepted. Over 36,000 euros.

172
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:37.840
Let the courts decide,
what was illegal about it

173
00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.480
and what was or was not party to it,
because the AfD did not want the money.

174
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.200
What was it?

175
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.640
Then invite my husband
and not me.

176
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.160
And then he says it was not a
donation but was on the floor.

177
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:52.000
Do you want to talk about my husband
or about me?

178
00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.200
No, I would like to talk to you about it as
as your husband's wife.

179
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.440
Or don't you talk about it
about it at home?

180
00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.360
Are men so little emancipated,

181
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:02.800
that they can't
can't talk about it themselves?

182
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:05.360
Do we women have to
do that today as well?

183
00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.840
As a woman, I would say yes,
he accepted illegal donations.

184
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.760
Yes, but what if it's not?

185
00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.800
You don't want your wife
that your wife says things,

186
00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.560
that are not true, right?
I don't have a wife at all.

187
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.560
If you had one,
you wouldn't want one either, would you?

188
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.560
Would you like that?
I would demand honesty.

189
00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.520
Exactly. Your husband
has accepted illegal donations.

190
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.920
Oh, you know, there's been
so much shit said about me

191
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.160
especially by journalists,
even if not by you.

192
00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.560
You have to be careful
what you say in public.

193
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.320
There one does not know any more,
what you're allowed to say, do you?

194
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:40.040
Yes, of course.
Yes?

195
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:43.600
You are often accused of something
which one has not said.

196
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:47.720
Even Mr. KrÃ¶mer will not be
not be taken to the cleaners.

197
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.320
It's terrible what the journalists
journalists ask.

198
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.400
And also such critical questions.

199
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.680
I have already given
given many interviews.

200
00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:01.480
The criticism from journalists is what,
that makes me so angry.

201
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:04.560
Yes, public broadcasting has always
broadcasting has always

202
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.880
contributed significantly to the media damage
in this country.

203
00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:11.480
The state broadcaster. Right. You as a
Clown from rbb know that. Yes.

204
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.360
Are you, I always wanted to
I've always wanted to ask you,

205
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.400
the opinion that these questions,
which are here now,

206
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:20.200
that Mrs. Merkel asked me
asked these questions?

207
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.240
I always get that accusation.

208
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.600
Oh, from whom?
From your ex-party.

209
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:28.480
Yes, but that's my ex-party.
Then they have to take responsibility for it.

210
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.880
You used to see that
seen it differently, didn't you?

211
00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:34.000
Read my book,
there I tell some stories,

212
00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.480
how journalists
turn the word in their mouths.

213
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.040
I am satisfied with the preparation
for this show,

214
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.160
I do not want to read
read your book.

215
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.080
But bring the subject to a close.

216
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.160
No, you go right
from the show

217
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.080
and then it's over,
then I'm not still reading your book.

218
00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:49.520
But it would be helpful.
So.

219
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.800
I have seen the "Frontal 21" report
about your meeting

220
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.800
with major donor Henning Conle.

221
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.120
I quote you: "He said,
Fear is the strongest driving force

222
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.520
of the human being, and I was
uncomfortable." End quote.

223
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.720
I said more.

224
00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.840
You are afraid of fear,
or how?

225
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.400
No, but it's not my thing
to act like that.

226
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:11.360
I can't imagine,
that you are afraid.

227
00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.840
You'll learn something new there, too.
Let's take a look at a VTR.

228
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.160
Make your crosses
for Merkel's plan

229
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.400
from Germany
a migration state

230
00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.800
without the rule of law
to make?

231
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.280
A country where living together

232
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.840
to be renegotiated on a daily basis
should?

233
00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:31.920
Or vote for a
reliable, free Germany,

234
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:36.120
in which our children
can grow up,

235
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.920
without increasingly feeling like strangers
in their own country?

236
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.240
Yes, you prophesy
a migration state

237
00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.240
without the rule of law,

238
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.000
no free Germany and that one feels
feel like a stranger in your own country.

239
00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.640
That's where you scare me.
Is that so?

240
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.000
You come from NeukÃ¶lln, you know,
what that feels like.

241
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.160
But wasn't that your job,
to play with fear all the time?

242
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:06.040
To campaign with the..., well.
actually the whole empire,

243
00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:09.080
which is now fucked,
but to build on fear?

244
00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:11.400
What do you mean by that?
What empire?

245
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:16.560
Your 4 years as a member of the AfD.
I see. Past. Yes.

246
00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.040
Have you not constantly
played with fear?

247
00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.720
This is a
general accusation in politics.

248
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:26.760
Name me one politician
who doesn't play on emotions.

249
00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:30.440
With fear. Do all.
With negative emotion.

250
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.240
Emotion in itself is cool.

251
00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.480
Permanent. Now we are
just afraid of Corona.

252
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.720
But scary emotion,
that is something else.

253
00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:42.000
All politicians play with fear.
All of them? All of them.

254
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:45.560
We're not getting anywhere here.
I'll do the next question, okay?

255
00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:48.160
If you agree with that.
With pleasure.

256
00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.960
With fear you came
with the AfD into the Bundestag

257
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:53.080
and the day after the federal election

258
00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:55.760
you wanted nothing more
to do with them.

259
00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.680
I call that voter deception.

260
00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.960
Nothing else comes to mind?
Well, what was it?

261
00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:05.160
Tell that to other people, too,
who leave the AfD?

262
00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:08.160
Is that then also voter deception
or inconsistency?

263
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.480
One day after the election
is won?

264
00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:13.040
After one knows
one has the Bundestag mandate

265
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.120
in the pocket
for the next 4 years.

266
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.320
Couldn't that have been
been done before?

267
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.760
Couldn't you have said,
I will not face the election campaign,

268
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.960
because it may be that
no longer participate with you at all?

269
00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:26.760
If you are interested in an honest answer
interested

270
00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.520
I try to explain it.

271
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.080
But it does not go
with half a sentence.

272
00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:33.760
The AfD has long since
no longer the party,

273
00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:35.440
which I helped to build.

274
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.200
But I believe
that a democracy thrives on it,

275
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.720
when there is a debate,
a controversy.

276
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.080
A somewhat more honest,
than we usually have

277
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.480
and that should also
take place in the Bundestag.

278
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:47.880
That was the reason
why I still helped the AfD,

279
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:49.640
to the Bundestag.

280
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.280
There is a lot I don't like,
what is said there,

281
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:55.080
but a controversy
this country must endure.

282
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.000
After your AfD career, you tried
you tried the Blue Party.

283
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.640
That's what went wrong. Yes.
How could that happen to you?

284
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:07.000
You are the great Frauke Petry
and then the thing craps out like this.

285
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.960
Do you want an honest answer?
Sure. Good. So.

286
00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.800
We founded the Blue Party
founded and noticed,

287
00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:18.160
that the offer
is not accepted.

288
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:21.400
Can we still add
"a record of horror"?

289
00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:23.840
Yes, best
in creepy letters.

290
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.400
We don't need to, it's scary enough.
scary enough. Yes, all good.

291
00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.400
2019 European elections
did not run,

292
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:35.960
0.4% in Saxony in 2009,
In Thuringia in 2019, only 0.1%.

293
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.560
What percentage do you need
to get in there again?

294
00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.320
You have not looked that up
or you do not know?

295
00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.880
I don't know that, no. If
you can't think of it, too bad.

296
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.440
But 0.4% or 0.1% won't get you into parliament, will it?
you don't get into parliament, do you?

297
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:53.040
There has to be a little bit more.
Yes, that's right.

298
00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:55.400
That is why the
the party no longer exists.

299
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.840
That was an attempt,
did not work.

300
00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.080
Too bad, isn't it? The Porsche too
- Bam - driven into the wall.

301
00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:03.680
Yes and still an offer,
made to the voter,

302
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.360
which he did not accept.

303
00:15:05.520 --> 00:15:08.120
What offer have you
already made to the voter?

304
00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:09.760
Besides clown at rbb?

305
00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.600
I am not a politician,
I don't have to make an offer.

306
00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.680
Why not, actually?
I am an entertainer.

307
00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:19.320
You are just... yes, you were...
Anyway, you are history.

308
00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.040
There are people who come
into parliament with satire.

309
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.760
They have not tried.
They are in the dungeon.

310
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.360
Yes, in the dungeon.
I feel really bad.

311
00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.720
Do you have anything to say about that,
about the balance sheet of horrors?

312
00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.640
That it didn't work out again,
what you were planning to do?

313
00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:37.000
Do you have
another number on it?

314
00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:39.760
No, I would just
go through your life.

315
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:42.480
Yes, but I am quite happy with my life.
quite content.

316
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.600
I am a mother of 6 children,
have learned a profession,

317
00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.000
my experience
in politics,

318
00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.600
have seen what works
and what does not.

319
00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.760
And leave scorched earth in their wake.
Oh yes, why is that?

320
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.400
Is there another party,
where you could say, knock, knock,

321
00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:00.360
this is mrs. petry,
could you include me?

322
00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:02.760
You know, I don't want
in any other party.

323
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.280
I also originally never wanted
never wanted to be in one.

324
00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:08.480
Or is it the case that you are
by shitting on the AfD,

325
00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.360
slammed the door so much
and still have bricked up

326
00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.920
and in front of it people with pistols
have put the say,

327
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.480
no one comes in here?

328
00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.800
I thought,
that's what you'd bring first.

329
00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:21.440
But now you have
fought your way through for so long,

330
00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.680
that the gun
comes only at the end.

331
00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.440
What gun?
Anything you want to talk about?

332
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.240
What do you mean by that?

333
00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.880
I just said,
You slammed a door

334
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.000
and do not come back
to the AfD,

335
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.760
the only party
where you could fit in,

336
00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.360
but not anymore.

337
00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.720
I certainly don't fit into the party
certainly no longer fit in

338
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.000
and the party between 2013
and 2016 was different from today.

339
00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.040
And the association with the gun,
where does it come from?

340
00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.440
I'm sure you'll tell me,
when it comes back to you.

341
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.360
Perhaps you were
you were also blinded at the time.

342
00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:55.600
An important Austrian
politician - not Hitler -

343
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:57.600
wished for the following:

344
00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:03.200
Yes, it is also my wish
that in the future hopefully

345
00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.120
a new chancellor
named Petry becomes possible.

346
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.600
That is also my wish.

347
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:17.600
Did you really think
that you would become chancellor?

348
00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:20.200
You know, there's a lot
a lot is said about you,

349
00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:22.000
when you are successful.

350
00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.520
If it had been important to me,
I wouldn't have dropped out, would I?

351
00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.040
But there it looks,
as if you thought:

352
00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:29.960
The man is right, this will be something.

353
00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.400
I do not know if you
with the poor picture quality

354
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.280
could look into the memory,

355
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.920
but that you would like to,
I can understand.

356
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:40.200
Can you remember the day
not remember?

357
00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.000
Should I bring the TV
closer or ask,

358
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.960
if we get more color in the picture?

359
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.960
Yes, I can remember that.

360
00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.480
But you put thoughts
and wishes into my mouth.

361
00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.120
Were you drunk on it?

362
00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.960
Is that like artists,
who let it go to their heads,

363
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.040
when you have such ass-kissers
around you,

364
00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.440
who say all day long,
you are the best?

365
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.040
Let us briefly review
review,

366
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.200
what I was doing at the time
made,

367
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.480
when others would certainly
would never have gotten off,

368
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.720
the day after the
supposedly greatest success.

369
00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.640
If you could be brief about that.
It's very short.

370
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.240
You have just accused me
I am on the day

371
00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.480
after the federal election
dropped out.

372
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:18.520
If I had only been concerned with power,
I would have stayed.

373
00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.040
So that was not my point,
but it was about

374
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.600
about other things
and that's why I left.

375
00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.320
What things were involved, for example?
I can tell you that.

376
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.680
The AfD has for once filled a gap
left by the CDU and FDP

377
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:33.280
and we wanted to make conservative-liberal
policy, an offer,

378
00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.640
that no longer exists in Germany
no longer exists,

379
00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:38.720
because none of the existing
parties can fill it.

380
00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.880
That did not work
for very different reasons.

381
00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:45.240
The past again!
One can only ever say,

382
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.560
it does not work here,
it doesn't work there.

383
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:49.840
Nothing worked out at all,
Mrs. Petry.

384
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.760
That is your view of things.

385
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.600
Has everything always worked out for you?
I think we all know that.

386
00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.560
I have also done a lot of shit
in my life,

387
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.200
but I'm not as stupid as you are
as you are, things are moving forward for me.

388
00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:05.800
That you say that is clear.
It goes on with me, too. Yes?

389
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.560
Now first write the book
and then sell 3-4 times

390
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.400
and also see there that it
everything is thought shit.

391
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.120
It is so sad,
I'm about to start crying.

392
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.600
You are a really sad person,
aren't you? I am very sad.

393
00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:23.160
Is there anything I can do to help?
No. We need better guests.

394
00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.080
But that is your responsibility
Your responsibility, not mine.

395
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:29.200
That was perhaps
a bad decision. Yes, exactly.

396
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:31.440
The Blue Party
dissolve at the end of 2019.

397
00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:34.320
You should have listened
listened to this woman here.

398
00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:37.200
We are joined by
a former campaigner.

399
00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:40.720
She even had Petry's posters
even hanging on her garden fence.

400
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.080
The very last thing
our country needs,

401
00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:46.280
is another party.

402
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.920
It's just to,
to share even more,

403
00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:53.320
to divide even more
in our people.

404
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.920
This Blue Party is for me
clearly a plan B.

405
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.600
Plan A did not work
and now you resort to plan B

406
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:06.760
in the hope of drawing votes
away from the AfD.

407
00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.080
Yes, I see it that way.

408
00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:13.280
And I am firmly convinced
that you will not succeed.

409
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:16.720
And I also wish you
that you do not succeed.

410
00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:18.720
They really went the extra mile.

411
00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.680
Why does the lady
more about politics than you?

412
00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:26.200
You know, after the election it takes
a lot to make that statement.

413
00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:30.520
Of course, the woman didn't want that,
because she was obviously an AfD voter.

414
00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:34.000
I understand that she
wished for that.

415
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:37.320
I believe, in the sense of the voters
is always a broad offer

416
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.800
and not,
that the supply is limited.

417
00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.760
Is the same as on the market.

418
00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.720
You have not experienced
you have not experienced, but I have.

419
00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:47.680
I would like to decide for myself
what I choose.

420
00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:50.160
There was a lot of scarcity
was the order of the day, wasn't it?

421
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.760
Where was the economy of scarcity?
That was just a thought.

422
00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:56.520
So we've heard,
Plan B has failed.

423
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.600
What was actually plan A?

424
00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:01.760
Then ask the woman.

425
00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.520
The woman has
the march.

426
00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:07.880
But you were the politician,

427
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.320
You must have
have had a plan A.

428
00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.760
I do not know
what the woman wanted back then.

429
00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.360
She was disappointed
and apparently of the opinion,

430
00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:17.480
we should have
should have stayed in the AfD.

431
00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.240
I can understand that,

432
00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:22.240
but the voter rarely looks
into a party only rarely.

433
00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:25.840
Because it didn't work with the AfD,
because they're all stupid,

434
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.320
you open a new party
and think they'll come along.

435
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.560
Did you seriously think
when you start a new party,

436
00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.040
do the AfD voters come along or
that you will then have more success?

437
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.360
In the end, it is not a matter of immediately
to take all voters with us.

438
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.080
In the end, the question is:

439
00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.440
Is there the offer with the ideas,
that we have pursued?

440
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.920
You should have so many voters
that you get over the 5%, right?

441
00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.640
Do you know how many parties
that in Germany

442
00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.480
try again and again
and not only once but

443
00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.440
five times, ten times over decades
and come to nothing?

444
00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:58.840
I admit that it
did not work,

445
00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.640
I am sure,
we wouldn't have tried,

446
00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.800
we would also have been
been reproached.

447
00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:07.320
In this respect, I do not know whether
you can do it right in this case.

448
00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.280
They didn't do it right.

449
00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:12.680
Retrospectively, such advice is
of course for the ass,

450
00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.160
because it is in the past,
but you did it wrong.

451
00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.000
Thank you for saying it yourself.

452
00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:21.440
We can check off and say,
it was another mistake. Petry-Stlye.

453
00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.240
How good that everyone else
do everything right.

454
00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.000
That's wonderful.
Then invite them.

455
00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.480
You have to do a little
right.

456
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.640
Not so much shit, but so,
that you also have success.

457
00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:36.200
It doesn't have to be a mega success,
but now you have zero success.

458
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.560
It depends,
how you define success.

459
00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:41.840
It is not called, from gold
It's the other way around.

460
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.960
Do you know the saying of Lindner...?

461
00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:47.280
What is it with you and Lindner?
I would like to share with you now...

462
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.360
Why don't you meet with Lindner?

463
00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:51.920
Let me finish my thought
to the end.

464
00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.640
They define success,

465
00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.320
for some it is success,
to play the clown at rbb

466
00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.200
or public broadcasting
broadcasting.

467
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:02.080
Why do you always say clown?
I am a star journalist.

468
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:05.880
Don't take it personally, do you?
You're going below the belt.

469
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.640
That's harmless. Yes.

470
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:11.040
For some, success,
always to stay in politics.

471
00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.960
That's where I define success differently.

472
00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.960
I would prefer truthfulness
and when parties see,

473
00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.880
that they have nothing to do with their
founding idea,

474
00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.600
they are welcome to dissolve.

475
00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:24.320
But what good is truthfulness,
if no one cares anymore?

476
00:23:24.480 --> 00:23:27.080
Oh, so rather mendacious
but the main thing.

477
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.880
When you say now,
I am now truthful,

478
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.960
then no one cares anymore.

479
00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.480
I got out in 2017,
where no one else would have exited.

480
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.120
Something completely different.

481
00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.120
This snippet from the nice
woman we just saw.

482
00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.040
This is from the WDR documentary "Frauke
Petry - Rise, Fall and Now?"

483
00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.840
For 45 minutes.

484
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.880
Why did you even

485
00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.560
with the left-wing green
Green riffraff from the WDR?

486
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.800
Why did you allow them
to be accompanied?

487
00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:59.360
In the documentary, they show
everything that went wrong.

488
00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.640
Everything goes wrong, without end.
Why?

489
00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:05.680
Do you have a problem when
shows the person Frauke Petry

490
00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:09.360
and I get the opportunity there
simply to tell.

491
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.280
45 minutes to show that everything
sucks in your life.

492
00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.960
But leave that to the
the viewer.

493
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:19.200
You see it that way, but you see
everything black tonight.

494
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.440
I am very sorry for you.
Can you be helped?

495
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:25.560
Maybe it is about the topic
or else a little bit

496
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.600
around the party you were in.

497
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.760
Yes. I also lack
a little bit of joy.

498
00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.440
I would also much rather laugh.
I don't think it's so bad.

499
00:24:33.600 --> 00:24:36.520
To be honest, I find it
quite funny what you're doing.

500
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.080
We really
in the editorial meeting,

501
00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:41.640
when we
prepared for you, cried.

502
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.680
Yes, but where are the handkerchiefs?

503
00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:46.480
It does not matter, we have
no more tear fluid.

504
00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:50.160
You should have told me,
then I would have brought some with me.

505
00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.240
In 2015, you were at the top.

506
00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.320
The inner-party power struggle
has been decided.

507
00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:57.320
Frauke Petry will lead the AfD in the future.

508
00:24:57.520 --> 00:25:00.240
Thus the
national conservative wing

509
00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.520
of the AfD prevailed
against party founder Bernd Lucke.

510
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.200
That's the one you sawed off with the right wing.
sawed off with the right wing.

511
00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:10.920
And then happens to you
the same fate.

512
00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.800
I have also been waiting for this.

513
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.040
Nice of you to dig that up too,
it's just not true.

514
00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:17.880
You know the saying:

515
00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.560
"History repeats itself
only as a farce"?

516
00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.280
It's just not true
what you have just said.

517
00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.040
I understand that the narrative
is circulating in the public.

518
00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:29.800
I also write about this
in my book.

519
00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.080
Did you know that
with Mr. HÃ¶cke

520
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:34.840
only a few times before this party congress
entertained

521
00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.760
and refused to cooperate with him.
cooperation.

522
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.080
You can not know,
because it was not written anywhere.

523
00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:42.720
Mr. HÃ¶cke? Yes, of course.

524
00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:45.440
In fact, there never was
this cooperation never existed.

525
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.960
And did you know that Mr. Lucke
has a very good relationship

526
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:50.600
with Mr. HÃ¶cke?

527
00:25:50.760 --> 00:25:53.120
Something that you and I
never distinguished.

528
00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.440
But still
the same thing happened,

529
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.600
what happened to him too, isn't it?
It is not the same.

530
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.280
Didn't even think that before:

531
00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:03.440
Shit, if that happens to me too,
would that really suck?

532
00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.000
We can now
repeat three more times.

533
00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:09.680
I know that from interviews, too,
but it doesn't make it any truer.

534
00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:12.040
They are of the opinion,
it is not right,

535
00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.920
You became something completely different
than Mr. Lucke.

536
00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.160
They have also
founded a party.

537
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:20.640
That one also crashed.
You don't see any parallels?

538
00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.200
So Mr. KrÃ¶mer, let's
do it right

539
00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.400
or do we want to
repeat the bullshit,

540
00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.640
that others have also
have claimed?

541
00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:31.280
We want to do everything right.
But just say.

542
00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.160
The party they founded
has also smeared.

543
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.480
Yes, but now you
don't deflect.

544
00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.560
You do not answer
to my question.

545
00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.640
That's the kind of talk
that lead nowhere in the end.

546
00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:43.360
Not for you, not for me.

547
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.280
But for the viewer,
because it's always the same.

548
00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.280
By the way, the half hour
is over according to my watch.

549
00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:50.880
Unfortunately, that is your life.

550
00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.680
Tell me beforehand
what you're cutting out.

551
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.320
Are you afraid that you might
that you might somehow come across as stupid?

552
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.960
You know, I've seen that many times.
The viewer decides.

553
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.680
Do you think that we here at
State Broadcasting cut around everything now,

554
00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.400
so that you look like shit
or do you think

555
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.600
that your statement here is already enough?

556
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:14.080
Yes, everything is sad for you.
Yes. Hmm. It's not bad.

557
00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.600
Some people are just sad,
some people are more relaxed.

558
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:20.000
But with you
it is really sad.

559
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:24.720
You think so? I think it's dead sad.
So, okay. Then we are...

560
00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.520
What time is it?

561
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:29.160
Perhaps we should still
clarify the question:

562
00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.440
You are now 45.
What's next?

563
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.080
What are your plans now?

564
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:35.160
You are 46,
what's next for you?

565
00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:37.480
I have my whole life
still ahead of me.

566
00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:40.000
Do you predict
my life expectancy?

567
00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:42.880
With you the stove is
off for the time being. What's next?

568
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.400
This is not a topic
for the public,

569
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.160
that's nice, isn't it?

570
00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.840
You think about that now
the next 20 years,

571
00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.680
until you retire, or what?

572
00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.120
Can you imagine going
going to "Let's Dance" now?

573
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:57.480
Or "Jungle Camp"
or "wife swap"?

574
00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.040
The beauty is:
With the end of the mandate

575
00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:02.600
ends the public person
Frauke Petry.

576
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.400
And you know, that's wonderful.
I have no problem with that at all.

577
00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.000
I am happy about that too.
Thank you very much.

578
00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.480
At least at the end.

579
00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:14.120
Thank you very much for quitting
and are out of the Bundestag.

580
00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.160
So, please follow me
again briefly for the closing statement.

581
00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.680
If you go around there,
we have one of those cut-off wheels,

582
00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.600
so that we don't catch it.

583
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.480
To make you feel safe,
I'll do it.

584
00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:29.880
So, Mrs. Petry.
You were in the AfD for 4 years.

585
00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.760
Historians will write,

586
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.880
that was a bird's nest
in German history.

587
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.600
Take care, neighbors.

588
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:39.920
