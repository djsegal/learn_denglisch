00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.000
There is a German base
in the Soviet Union,

4
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.240
where German pilots are trained as
are trained as fighter pilots.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720
What else do you need?
- Witnesses, files, photographs.

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.960
Both victims died,
just as they were about to join you,

7
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.560
or had already reached you
had arrived, Mr. Rath.

8
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.960
What?
Her nephew found Jänicke.

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.800
Why did you shoot
Father Wilczek shot?

10
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.480
With the service weapon.
You replaced the bullets.

11
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.920
You shouldn't have
Krajewski's gun.

12
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.680
But all the evidence points
point to a Cologne cop.

13
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.880
Where was it?
At Wolter's house.

14
00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.720
That can't be.
It's all shorthand.

15
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.240
You have to
for me.

16
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.680
Go through it
at home at your leisure.

17
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.960
You can't watch that.

18
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.680
Well, man, I think
you need a schnapps.

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.920
What are you doing?

20
00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:16.400
Come on, in you go, doll!

21
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:36.920
*She groans.

22
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.800
*She coughs.

23
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.160
Hello?

24
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.840
*exciting music*

25
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.800
*uncanny music

26
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.640
*rhythmic music

27
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.800
*She gasps.

28
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.600
Hey, what are you doing? Leave it!

29
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.320
*She gasps for breath.

30
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:10.600
*She coughs.

31
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.880
*There's a knock.

32
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.160
Yes.

33
00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:30.960
What do you know about the gold?

34
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.560
Gold?

35
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.000
Which gold?

36
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.720
Dit gold on the train.

37
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:46.360
Uh ...

38
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600
I ...

39
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:50.000
I don't know of any gold.

40
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.840
She knows, she was there.

41
00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.160
What do you know about the gold?
Nothing.

42
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.560
I ...

43
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Nothing.

44
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.240
*exciting music*

45
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.320
What do you know about the gold?

46
00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.120
Girl, talk!

47
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.840
Talk to him!
She knows, she was there.

48
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:31.120
Nothing.

49
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.560
That means he's lying.

50
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.400
*He unlocks the gun.
No, wait!

51
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.800
I know nothing
of any gold.

52
00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.760
Please, please, talk to him.
You were there.

53
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.320
She was there.

54
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.640
Good.

55
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.440
Then we wait.

56
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.880
*exciting music*

57
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.560
Let go of me, you bastard!

58
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200
No, no, no ...

59
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.920
*She cries out.

60
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.320
*mumble*

61
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.920
Good, exactly the material
we needed.

62
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.960
We can initiate the
procedure into action.

63
00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.360
Very good work.

64
00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.440
Congratulations, gentlemen.

65
00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.120
So let's get started.

66
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.800
We hereby file a criminal complaint

67
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.120
against the members
of the General Staff of the Reichswehr,

68
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.800
which has been
Construction and upgrading

69
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.400
of an illegal aircraft fleet
to push ahead.

70
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:40.440
And with the support
the Red Army of the Soviet Union

71
00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.280
in Lipetsk,
300 km south-east of Moscow.

72
00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.920
Furthermore
the following facts are reported:

73
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.520
In a locomotive shed
in Berlin stands

74
00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.480
a freight train smuggled in from the Soviet Union
smuggled in from the Soviet Union

75
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.920
with 13 wagons
full of highly concentrated poison gas.

76
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.680
Which gas is it?
- Phosgene, Your Honor.

77
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.880
But the train is just
the tip of the iceberg.

78
00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:08.480
A modern German shadow
shadow force is being built up,

79
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.400
bypassing the government
and in deliberate breach

80
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.200
of the agreements
of the Treaty of Versailles.

81
00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.640
The "Black Reichswehr"
is the greatest threat

82
00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.000
of peace in Europe since 1918.

83
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:25.680
These conspirators threaten the
sovereignty of the German Reich.

84
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.680
Alone in the Berlin military district

85
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.200
are at this time
30,000 men under arms.

86
00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.160
Major General Seegers?
Major von Beck? You are under arrest.

87
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.600
(Benda) Everywhere in the capital

88
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.680
are hiding places
with branched ammunition.

89
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.400
This organization is preparing
in the coming days,

90
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.680
perhaps already at the hour,
a coup.

91
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.120
We must act immediately.

92
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.560
That seems sound to me.
- No objections.

93
00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.760
The application is granted.

94
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:08.520
*exciting music*

95
00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:46.440
Well, little Schmeling?

96
00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:52.680
*exciting music*

97
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.280
Have the interrogations started yet?

98
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.320
Has Miss Ritter
show her face today?

99
00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.640
No.
- No.

100
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:03.560
That's not possible.
Something urgent?

101
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.320
You could say that.

102
00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:08.560
Let me know immediately,
when she arrives.

103
00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.200
Yes.
- Yes.

104
00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.480
Come on.

105
00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.920
Can you handle it?

106
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.960
I'll show you.

107
00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.560
Grab a few of them.

108
00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.480
*exciting music*

109
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.480
I'll do that.

110
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.000
Major von Beck.

111
00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.600
Name, address, date of birth, rank.

112
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:26.440
What do you allow yourself?

113
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.440
Sit down.

114
00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:31.840
Name, address, date of birth, rank.

115
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.320
Major von Beck.

116
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.800
From Beck, Anton.

117
00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:48.320
I object to
the arrest of my client.

118
00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.960
Please take a seat,
Major General.

119
00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.720
*exciting music*

120
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.480
*exciting music*

121
00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:22.720
What is that, Mr. Wolter?
An M/28?

122
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.400
Nope.
This is something very special.

123
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:28.960
We will be making
history tomorrow.

124
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.840
Together with this one.

125
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.120
Well, come along then.

126
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.200
*exciting music*

127
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:53.720
Quite an unusual holiday destination
Vacation destination, no?

128
00:13:56.200 --> 00:14:00.920
Since 1925 they have spent 44
spent a week in Lipetsk since 1925.

129
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.120
That's almost a year.

130
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.320
What did you do there?

131
00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:09.800
*exciting music*

132
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.520
51, 52, 53, 54, 55,

133
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:16.240
56, 57, 58, 59, 60,

134
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.840
61, 62, 63, 64 ...

135
00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.680
72, 73, 74, 75.

136
00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.800
(calls) 75.

137
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:45.520
Respect.

138
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.440
You are
a real bull's eye.

139
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.600
The Chief of Police
is in the out...

140
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.480
You can't ...

141
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.640
Mr. Wendt. What brings you to me?
I don't take ...

142
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:15.400
You probably still don't understand
the extent of your actions.

143
00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.600
*He breathes deeply.

144
00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.280
And your destination just happens to be
littered with German airplanes?

145
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.760
The Reichswehr Ministry is responsible for this
is responsible.

146
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.200
No, you are responsible for
Information about your whereabouts

147
00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:50.400
and the reasons for your travels.

148
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.800
This is about more
than your career

149
00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.920
or my political
convictions.

150
00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.880
Yes, about the foundations
of our constitution.

151
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.160
Which jeopardizes the existence
of the German nation.

152
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:06.880
The law protects our citizens
from illegal armament.

153
00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.280
Why do you of all people believe this?

154
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.720
You would have to protect the citizens
of this country?

155
00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.160
What do you mean?

156
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.880
Please leave the national issues
please leave them to the people,

157
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:20.760
on whose floor you are standing.

158
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:40.960
What about you?

159
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.200
Walls.

160
00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:49.000
Is there anything new
about the notebook?

161
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:52.880
I sent the colleagues
to her home.

162
00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:02.680
The arrest warrant was adjusted.

163
00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.960
That was to be expected. From whom?

164
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.800
Office of the President.

165
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.360
What does that mean, please?

166
00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.960
That means
until seven o'clock tomorrow morning

167
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.240
I won't allow any more interrogations.

168
00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.640
Why is that?

169
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.240
The President of the Reich is abroad.

170
00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.480
As long as he does not
does not authorize it,

171
00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:24.480
my hands are tied.

172
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.760
You can't do that, Karl!

173
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.400
We have been waiting for this
we have been waiting for years.

174
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.400
Sorry, gentlemen.

175
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:35.200
Tomorrow morning
you can continue.

176
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.800
The opponent is strong ...

177
00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.240
and everywhere.

178
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:47.600
And?
 Not to be found.

179
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:50.200
Not to be found.
- That's what I said.

180
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.520
Who?

181
00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.680
*She breathes frantically.

182

Then go inside.

let's let ourselves

192
00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.240

So let's get to work,
we have no time to lose.

223
00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.160
*laughter*

224
00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:58.280
At the end of the 1st act, there is a
a shoot-out takes place on stage.

225
00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.720
Under cover of this noise
we will strike.

226
00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.280
(Seegers)
In the event of successful deployment

227
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:07.440

229
00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:18.960
*applause*

230
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:23.400
The scouts give our troops,

231
00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:27.160
waiting in the streets and
in the ministries,

232
00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.320
the signal for use.

233
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:33.800
The head of the ministerial office,
General von Schleicher,

234
00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.680
takes command
and triggers the pillory day.

235
00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:39.840
So the mobilization
of military districts 1 and 2

236
00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:44.800
and subsequently all the barracks
of the German Reich.

237
00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.000
Our troops
occupy the Reichstag.

238
00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:50.360
Our troops
occupy the police headquarters.

239
00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:52.240
The following is the determination

240
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:56.760
of all key democratic
figures in politics and the military,

241
00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.400
including
the person of the Chief of Police

As Chief of the High Command
of the Army Command

244
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:09.720
I then go with
Major Beck to the Haus des Rundfunks,

245
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.120
where the new Reich Chancellor,
General Ludendorff,

246
00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.760
announces the end of the republic

247
00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.560
and the reintroduction
of the monarchy.

248
00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.840
As soon as Berlin is secured,

249
00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:25.680
His Majesty, the Emperor, returns
returns from exile

250
00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.680
and addresses his beloved people
to his beloved people.

251
00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.960
(Crowd) Long live the emperor!

252
00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:35.400
With God's help, we will then,

253
00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:38.400
under the guiding hand
of His Majesty,

254
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.520
back to the victorious nation,

255
00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.120
to which we
have always been destined to.

256
00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.600
Gentlemen, we are in

257
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:51.800

in German history.

Long live Ludendorff!

Where is Fritz?
- I don't know.

265

He wanted to take me
into the meeting.

Where is he?
- What's going on?

267

Your Fritz, he's a hothead,
do you know that?

268
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.360
Through the wall with the Hitzkopp,
that's simply not possible.

269
00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:13.840
There he is. Fritz!

270
00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:15.680
Don't do that.
- Why?

Gretchen.

272
00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:20.280
We've been ratted out.
- What?

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.600
From whom?

274
00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.880
Shit, the floppy hats!

275
00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:30.000
Leave me alone. Leave me alone!

276

277

Don't touch me!
Let me through!

Girl, you are repeating
my words instead of answering.

303
00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:03.840
I don't know anything.

304
00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.240
I know nothing! I know nothing!

00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:38.200
You don't know who I am?

360
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.680
No, you don't know.

361
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.840
My father was a factory owner,
in Russia.

362
00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:51.920
When the revolution came,
he had everything,

363
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:54.520
what he owned,
exchanged for gold.

364
00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.960
And this gold,
he hid it well.

365
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.480
In a railroad car.

366
00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.240
As children
we used to play in it,

367
00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:08.400
my brothers and I.

368
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.160
With Tanja,
the daughter of our chauffeur.

369
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.720
This murderer.

370
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.120
He betrayed us
to the Bolsheviks.

371
00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.120
He had my family killed

372
00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.600
and all the gold
and snatched all the gold.

373
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.600
Then he disappeared
in the turmoil of war.

374
00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:37.240
But Kardakov
has tracked him down

375
00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.720
and brought the wagon to Berlin.

376
00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.160
But in this car
is not gold.

377
00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:46.160
No?

378
00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:12.160
("The shadow army of the German
Reich - by Samuel Katelbach."

379
00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:17.360
"... the Reichswehr has
for a long time

380
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:21.480
the illegal rearmament
of the German air force.")

381
00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.440
*BELL*

382
00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:32.640
*knock*

383
00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.120
Mrs. Behnke?

384
00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:41.600
I wouldn't have thought it,
that I'd see you again so soon.

385
00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.320
I actually just wanted
to see Katelbach. Is he there?

386
00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.600
Please.

387
00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:54.600
Thank you.

388
00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:17.760
Mr. Katelbach.

389
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.240
*He cries out.

390
00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.280
What's wrong with you?

391
00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:30.640
Nothing.

392
00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:33.880
Thank you, no problem.

393
00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.440
What are you doing here?

394
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:41.640
I read your article
about the "Black Reichswehr".

395
00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.160
Are you with the political party now?

396
00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.520
Yesterday there was a goon squad
in the editorial office.

397
00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:50.360
Have destroyed everything
and taken away,

398
00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:53.320
what Neanderthals
consider important.

399
00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:58.000
Among other things, a list with the
private addresses of all employees.

400
00:37:58.240 --> 00:37:59.240
Oh, thank you.

401
00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.400
Who is your informant?

402
00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.120
It must be someone
from the command staff.

403
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.320
Someone from the innermost circle.

404
00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:25.920
The article
is teeming with details.

405
00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:29.120
I'm giving an investigator
from the Political

406
00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.160
my confidential sources
do not reveal.

407
00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:35.800
*He gargles.

408
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.600
Mr. Katelbach,
I am on the verge,

409
00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.800
15 high-ranking officers
of the "Black Reichswehr"

410
00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.920
from custody
to be released again,

411
00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:49.920
although we have overwhelming
evidence against them.

412
00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:51.320
In what matter?

413
00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560
Procurement

414
00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.720
internationally banned
weapons of mass destruction.

415
00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.560
Who do you have in your sights?

416
00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:06.560
Major Beck, Freiligrath,
von Bock, Erhardt, Escherich,

417
00:39:07.200 --> 00:39:08.320
Seegers.

418
00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.720
Do you know what you are doing?

419
00:39:15.680 --> 00:39:18.600
You are messing with the state
with the state itself.

420
00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:21.840
I realize that.

421
00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.680
Gereon, whatever you do,
make it public.

422
00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:31.680
Only the public
can protect you.

423
00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:35.600
They are not squeamish.
A thousand murders in five years.

424
00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.400
Murders of informers, journalists.

425
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.320
Sudden deaths
of secret bearers.

426
00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:44.360
Only a fraction
of the perpetrators in court

427
00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.760
and always acquitted.

428
00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:50.400
I need support.

429
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:54.760
And you know someone
who might be able to give it to me.

430
00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:05.720
Yes?

431
00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.120
Is it perhaps possible
a little earlier?

432
00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:12.000
Yes, good, good. Thank you.

433
00:40:13.160 --> 00:40:14.160
Where?

434
00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:18.840
Half an hour at the corner of Fugger.
But only if I'm there.

435
00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:22.200
Right, then I'll go
blow my nose and fight.

436
00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:24.880
*He sighs.

437
00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:35.000
Half a spoonful of sugar.

438
00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.880
With pleasure.

439
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400
*She starts to speak.

440
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.640
*She starts to speak.

441
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:16.000
(Katelbach) Yes, let's go.

442
00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.280
Thank you.

443
00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:23.920
Bruno should
get in touch with me again.

444
00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.520
Please tell him that.
I'll do that.

445
00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.960
See you soon.

446
00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:33.880
*quiet music

447
00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.240
Mr. Rath!

448
00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:50.760
Cab, cab!

449
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.440
I found this
under your bed.

450
00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.560
Come on now, Mr. Rath!

451
00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.800
Thank you.

452
00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.480
Gee, watch out!
No eyes in your head?

453
00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:16.640
*exciting music*
