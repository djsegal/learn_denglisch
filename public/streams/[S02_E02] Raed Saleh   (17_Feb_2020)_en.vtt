Runs for SPD leader of Berlin,
together with Franziska Giffey.

8
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.920
Mr. Saleh,
have you taken a seat?

9
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.920
Yes, I am sitting here
and look forward to seeing you.

10
00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.920
Wonderful. Let's face it,
You are happy about every evening,

11
00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.800
that you don't
have to spend in Spandau, huh?

12
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.200
I like to be with you today,
believe me.

13
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.560
He always tried
not to suck up. Can that be?

14
00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.000
I have ... I'm coming in.
I'll ask the questions. Okay.

15
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.720
So.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.360
* long humming *

17
00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.800
We had to wait for the passing
steamer passing by. You ...

18
00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.840
Please take a seat.
Okay, okay.

19
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.880
Take a seat.
I don't recognize you. Please?

20
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
I do not recognize you.

21
00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.480
So. You answer please only,
if you are asked. Okay.

22
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.440
Do we stay like this? Okay.

23
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.000
You look good. Please? Stop
stop sucking up. No, really!

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.440
You could be
be party leader in Berlin.

25
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.080
What kind of party leader?
Head of the SPD.

26
00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.320
With you, or what? Yes.
(laughs) We'll get to that. Okay.

27
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.880
(ironic)
Party leader at the SPD ...

28
00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.880
I might as well have my life
on RTL2.

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.920
* Kevin Kühnert said to me,
I should be nice to you.

30
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.600
Mr. Saleh, pay attention.
The situation is serious. Okay.

31
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.480
Your Berlin SPD is in a bad way,

32
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.600
only in fourth place
behind the Greens, the Left Party and the CDU.

33
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.360
Just ahead of the Animal Welfare Party.
We are changing that.

34
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.240
How did you screw that up? You
have been the head of the parliamentary group for eight years.

35
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.280
Together we will
with the entire Berlin SPD ...

36
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.080
Are you already in unwind mode?
Yes, exactly.

37
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.840
Now that's schema F.
Let's be honest. We ...

38
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800
Do we have the ...
We can't rewind.

39
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.560
Now that's really ...

40
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.720
I ask you,
how this turd was created

41
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.880
and you say:
The weather is nice ...

42
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.240
I said the weather will be nice,
because together we ...

43
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.640
You've been Group Chairman for eight years.
We have done a lot of good work.

44
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.080
That's why: The weather will be nice.
Apparently not.

45
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.440
You have let the cart
completely die.

46
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.160
(groans) Yes, but the important thing is that
the SPD is in a situation ...

47
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.600
Have you learned this by heart?
No. Or is it written on the wall?

48
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.000
This is what is displayed to me up here.

49
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.960
How can you
screw up like that?

50
00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.040
I believe,
that the SPD is needed and ...

51
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.920
From whom?
From the people of Berlin.

52
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.120
Because we can show in Berlin,

53
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.440
that we keep this city
affordable for many.

54
00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.920
That's what I stand for,
and you know that, too.

55
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.200
That's not on my note,
no. * (LAUGHING)

56
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.040
When Klaus Wowereit announced his

57
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.800
you were the first to jump in front of the
later, you were the first to jump in front of the cameras.

58
00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.960
We have a VTR.
Show.

59
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.880
I would like to ... reigning
Mayor of Berlin.

60
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.120
Director, can we play that
play that again, please? * (LAUGHING)

61
00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.760
I would like to ...

62
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.680
We've flown in forensics from Los Angeles
from Los Angeles. * (LAUGHING)

63
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.320
They calculated,

64
00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.160
that someone must have been standing here
must have been standing here.

65
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.200
It was you!
Were you forced to say that?

66
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.400
(laughs) Yes, it was like that.

67
00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.640
So, watch out. Do I look...
Stop it! Quiet now!

68
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.480
The joy ...
Stop now!

69
00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.240
We'll take another look at the MAZ.
Okay.

70
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.560
This is the third time out of 80.

71
00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.480
Today? Oh dear.
Maz off.

72
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.640
I would like to ... reigning
Mayor of Berlin.

73
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.480
Do you see the joy?
Now my question.

74
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.680
Why do you have ...

75
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.840
with this short statement ...

76
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.960
looked at your paper three times?
* (LAUGHING)

77
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.920
You also look permanently
at your paper.

78
00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.880
Why did you look at the page three times
three times on the page?

79
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.680
Just imagine,
you are the mayor.

80
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.920
Nero sets the city on fire,
everything burns.

81
00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.240
You have to step out onto the balcony
balcony and calm everyone down.

82
00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.840
You can't slap that many notes
and read them out loud.

83
00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.080
You can't just
in front of people and say:

84
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.640
I would like to ...

85
00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.080
Communicate:

86
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.960
It burns.
* Laughter *

87
00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.320
Uh...
All Berliners ... Berliners:

88
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.680
Now spit out the window!
* (LAUGHING)

89
00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.600
You know? I brought you something
...for you. I don't want it.

90
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.600
Look.
Whoa, guys.

91
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.280
Look!
Yes, great.

92
00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.720
Lots of goodies. I was told:
Try to get him into the party.

93
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.960
If nobody wants your shit,
you go to Kurt Krömer.

94
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.200
What do you think
this anti-stress cube?

95
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.040
The only thing
that bothers me is "SPD".

96
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.040
Other than that, it's quite nice.

97
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.480
And this keychain?
No, watch this.

98
00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.840
I'll watch that later.
* (LAUGHING)

99
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.760
I am very happy about it.
Great, there is something for everyone.

100
00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.080
You get one.
I'd like to... Yes.

101
00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.520
Thank you very much.
To you too.

102
00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.800
You're grasping at straws,
what?

103
00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:12.760
I was told that we must
try to bring everyone into the party.

104
00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.360
The heart beats on the left, doesn't it?

105
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:19.960
I'll ask the questions. Okay.
* (LAUGHING)

106
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.280
The Filly cup looks great on you.
You've put it here for me.

107
00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.520
* Laughter *

108
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.840
Do you hear? There's a party over there,
there is laughter.

109
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:39.080
Good. The candidacy
worked out great back then, didn't it?

110
00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.880
It was a flop.

111
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.440
Because of the speech, perhaps?

112
00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.640
Maybe free speech ...
Conceivable. Try.

113
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.960
Shall we give it a try?
I am not responsible for that.

114
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:59.920
Then you have virtually lost
against the great charismatic,

115
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.520
the talking paper clip, the
running cardigan Michael Müller.

116
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.920
You're going to have to do better than that.
* (LAUGHING)

117
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.680
Now there would be room for a response.
* Laughter *

118
00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.040
The cup is beautiful.

119
00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.320
You have worked for years
working towards Müller's end.

120
00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:27.800
He is the most unpopular
head of government in Germany

121
00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:29.440
and now wants to stop.

122
00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.080
You would have to say:
Now it's my turn, here we go.

123
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.280
No, I would like to
together with Franziska Giffey

124
00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.040
Responsibility
in the Berlin SPD.

125
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.720
Together? Together.

126
00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:43.800
You have to say that, don't you?
You have to.

127
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:47.480
Like the Greens, we now also have
the so-called dual leadership.

128
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.880
We take over a lot
from the Greens and I find ...

129
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.960
Did you work towards that,
for Müller to leave,

130
00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.840
that he takes his hat
and walking stick and leaves?

131
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.520
No, Michael Müller
does in Berlin ...

132
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.160
You didn't work towards it?
No. He does good work.

133
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:11.120
In 2017 you have
15 SPD deputies ...

134
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.720
in an incendiary letter,
that you are...

135
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.320
sawed on the chair.

136
00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.440
No, not sawed on the chair,
on the contrary. We make ...

137
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.760
Put down one more chair?
I would like to talk to Franziska Giffey

138
00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.160
for the SPD
Taking responsibility.

139
00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.040
Yes, you have again
fabulously formulated. VTR off.

140
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.840
All are needed.

141
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.000
All will
pull together in the same direction,

142
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:44.600
in the interest of the party

143
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.360
and in the interest of the city.

144
00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:50.160
Was better after all! How did it go on?
All will take a gun

145
00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.240
and shoot yourself in the head?

146
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.240
But I no longer read off.
No, but ... Progress.

147
00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.520
Yes, but ...
A praise at least.

148
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:02.880
He always tried to speak freely,
to speak freely.

149
00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:06.320
Your rhetorical talents
I do not have yet.

150
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.440
Franziska Giffey,
Federal Minister for Family Affairs. Yes.

151
00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:15.600
She's going to steal
the job of mayor away from you after all.

152
00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.320
Franziska is really very good
and very recognized.

153
00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:24.440
It enjoys a high reputation in Germany
and Berlin a high reputation

154
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.360
and is the best,
we have.

155
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.280
But you will again
you're going to lose out again, aren't you?

156
00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.560
I would like to work with her
to move the SPD forward.

157
00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:35.200
I think,
Franziska is one,

158
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.400
which in Berlin
can conquer the hearts.

159
00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.960
Ms. Giffey ...
Giffey. Giffey.

160
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.960
Did you just improve me?

161
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.800
No!
* (LAUGHING)

162
00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.720
You can cut it in such a way
so that it is not noticeable.

163
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.520
Now I notice my slip of the tongue.
Sorry.

164
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.800
So, Mrs. Giffey ...
Giffey.

165
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.600
Giffey is better than you. Why?

166
00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.280
Camera three.

167
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:04.520
Franziska Giffey is someone who appeals to
appeals to the people of Berlin.

168
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:07.600
She knows
where the problems are in the city

169
00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.480
and has down-to-earth,
pragmatic solutions.

170
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.840
Was that spoken fit to print?

171
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.840
But actually
you want to rule alone.

172
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.960
I would like Franziska ...
You have to say that again now.

173
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.960
But the chair
will also be sawn at some point.

174
00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.080
I would like Franziska Giffey to
together with me ...

175
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:30.960
Alone perhaps? The party ...
Alone. Say: alone.

176
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.760
Say:
"Ms. Giffey is doing this alone.

177
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.920
I have to make some speeches again.
I have to make speeches again..." Where is the camera?

178
00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.280
Please? Where is the camera?
Where you want.

179
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.200
She is the best in Berlin.

180
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.680
When you look there,
someone pushes them there.

181
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.440
You can also
drive the guy completely insane.

182
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.800
Franziska Giffey is the best,
we have in Berlin.

183
00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.560
(laughs) Did it fit?

184
00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.480
But why
is she better than you?

185
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:01.200
I have experienced it
again just yesterday.

186
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.840
We were
at a reception in Neukölln.

187
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.520
She conquers the hearts of the people,
speaks plainly, comes across,

188
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:13.040
is down-to-earth and knows the
the problems from her time in Neukölln.

189
00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:16.320
Can you speak in such a way
that we can cut better?

190
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:21.840
Franziska Giffey knows the problems
of the city better than anyone else.

191
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
And it goes down really
really well received.

192
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:28.600
With quite a few,
whether old or young ... * Laughter *

193
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.240
Period. Period.

194
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.280
A Berlin magazine writes ...
You have prepared well.

195
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.600
"Saleh has the mayor's job
firmly in his sights.

196
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.200
The number two
might be too small for him in the long run."

197
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:44.240
You've been seen through.
I'll gladly take number two.

198
00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.600
And I'm looking forward to ...
(annoyed) Ms. Giffey, of course.

199
00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:50.440
We'll put that in the back.
So you know!

200
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.240
* Niau *
* Laughter *

201
00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.080
(groans) Your phrases always.
You're in a good mood again.

202
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.760
The hardest part of this job,
is interviewing you guys:

203
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.760
You go around in circles,
always have an answer,

204
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:10.320
that no one wants to hear or
related to the question.

205
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.000
Come on, the next question.

206
00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:16.280
You will have to share the SPD chairmanship
with Ms. Giffey.

207
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:19.400
Why doesn't she do it alone?

208
00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:24.240
We have decided
to do this in a dual leadership.

209
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.920
* (LAUGHING)
That's why she came and said...

210
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.160
Do we have
a tape recorder under the table,

211
00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:34.320
where I accidentally
pressed replay?

212
00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.920
It keeps rewinding.
Then ask another question.

213
00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.000
Giffey is the figurehead
and you bring the drinks, right?

214
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.320
Franziska Giffey ...
Beauty and the Beast.

215
00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.640
* Laughter *

216
00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.560
Uh...

217
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.720
Response. Franziska Giffey is
the best we have in Berlin.

218
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.840
It will move the SPD forward.
Are you also convinced?

219
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.160
(laughs) I ask the questions.
I'm just a service provider here.

220
00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.120
If I were to speak
I would talk about it,

221
00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.880
what thoughts I have about it,
I would get four years in prison.

222
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.800
* (LAUGHING)
Then I will visit you.

223
00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.160
Giffey and you were both
promoted by Heinz Buschkowsky,

224
00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.400
the old mayor of Neukölln.

225
00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.760
Buschkowsky said,
Giffey will never allow

226
00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.520
that Saleh is her equal.

227
00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.600
This is going to be fun, isn't it?

228
00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.680
Ms. Giffey and I
have known each other for many years.

229
00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.240
Did you say Mrs. Giffey?
No, Franziska. You say Giffey.

230
00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.240
I don't call her Franziska.
I don't know her.

231
00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:43.400
We know each other for many years,
have lived in Spandau, Neukölln...

232
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:46.400
And then you went
went on vacation... No.

233
00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:51.160
And then you said: My God,
how can we move this forward?

234
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.600
What connects us,
that we have the view of Berlin

235
00:13:54.760 --> 00:14:00.440
and not only tackle issues in the Prenzlauer
Berg in the chic neighborhood,

236
00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.680
but also in Spandau,
Marzahn-Hellersdorf, etc.

237
00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.760
You are
a savvy string puller.

238
00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.120
And you an extremely heavy smoker.

239
00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:12.280
"He is considered
as a master of rope teams,

240
00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.480
as a fake brother
and sly communicator",

241
00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:18.160
writes the Tagesspiegel.
Kurt Krömer?

242
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:22.320
This is from 2/9/2020 Yes.

243
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.760
"Those who know Saleh know that he will
will pull the strings."

244
00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.960
From your point of view:
Giffey the bitch, you the babo.

245
00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.720
* Laughter *

246
00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.920
I thought they were describing you.
"Sly" was written here.

247
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:42.440
No, we have everything available.
From the Tagesspiegel, 9.2.2020.

248
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.040
In the press
not only friends, you know that.

249
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:49.240
I have only friends.
Only friends, mhm.

250
00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:54.080
Franziska Giffey has
copied in her doctoral thesis.

251
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.760
Who says so? No.

252
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.800
"Her husband Karsten Giffey
has just been convicted of fraud

253
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.840
Removed from civil service,

254
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.560
for allegedly accounting for fictitious
allegedly accounted for."

255
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:08.920
The Giffeys are sly, aren't they?
* (LAUGHING)

256
00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:12.640
The university said,
that her doctoral thesis is correct.

257
00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.800
They said,
she misquoted,

258
00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.440
but not forged.

259
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:22.600
Exactly, and her doctorate
was not revoked.

260
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:26.200
Be fair. She stole,
but not stolen.

261
00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.960
No, she has
neither stole nor stole.

262
00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:32.320
The university did not
did not deprive her of the title.

263
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.760
She copied quotes.
As for her husband, be fair:

264
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:40.640
In Germany there is
Thank God there is no clan liability.

265
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.400
You also do not want to
to take the responsibility for others.

266
00:15:43.680 --> 00:15:47.440
Was he removed from service
or not? That's what it says.

267
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.920
Nevertheless, there is
there is no clan liability in Germany.

268
00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:54.280
He was removed.
Nevertheless, there is no clan liability.

269
00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.160
You also do not want

270
00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.840
for someone in your family
for someone in your family, right?

271
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.480
If I call them on Monday ...
No, today is Tuesday.

272
00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.240
Today is Tuesday, that's right.
* (LAUGHING)

273
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:12.520
Tuesday.
(mumbles) 10 p.m. ... 12.

274
00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:14.240
If I call there tomorrow:

275
00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:17.480
Is he still sitting in the place
where he worked?

276
00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:22.200
Or has it been removed? There is
no clan liability in Germany.

277
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.720
You've said that three times already.
Is he still working?

278
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.200
I don't know.
I see.

279
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:32.040
But there are
in Germany no ...

280
00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:36.400
(annoyed) Sippenhaft. Correct.
And now all. * (LAUGHING)

281
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:40.640
If you do not want to answer,
you tell everything four times.

282
00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.640
You are persistent.
Five times, six times.

283
00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:46.640
We will call there
and find out.

284
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:51.960
We will fade in below,
if the man is still reachable there.

285
00:16:52.120 --> 00:16:54.160
Do we stay like this?
Do that.

286
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.600
(breathes heavily) A tough nut to crack.
You have a nice suit.

287
00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.120
Are you in love with me?
In the suit.

288
00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.040
Look, mine is quite simple.
Both suits are blue.

289
00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.040
But this one is special.
My God.

290
00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:11.200
What's the difference?
I rarely see you so chic.

291
00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.720
Are you going out later?
Yes.

292
00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:17.760
Tuesday, 10:15 p.m.

293
00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:23.440
I have the impression that there
perhaps there are still opposing candidacies.

294
00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:25.360
VTR off.

295
00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.240
(woman) Do you expect
with opposing candidatures?

296
00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:35.960
Yes, that may be.
But so far I am not aware of any.

297
00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:38.600
* Laughter *

298
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.360
You are mean.

299
00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.560
He's mean.

300
00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.520
Is he still in office or not?
* Who?

301
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.600
You forgot again, didn't you?
That's also ...

302
00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:57.720
What do you mean? Either
say everything four times or forget it.

303
00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:00.920
Do you remember who I am?
You're the Kurt. Yes.

304
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.080
Kurt Krämer.
Krämer, exactly.

305
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:05.000
* (LAUGHING)
Yeah, cool.

306
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:08.840
Ey ...
Can I have a sip of water?

307
00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:12.120
Please? Sip water.
Sip of water?

308
00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:15.160
For you, not for me.
Is he still in office or not?

309
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:19.960
The reigning mayor?
He is in office and remains so.

310

* Laughter *

311
00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.320
Thirsty?

312
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.040
Did you drink from it? No.

313
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.400
No, but I have
along the edge. * Laughter *

314
00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:37.160
There's a hair in it, look.
Let me see. (laughs) You can have it.

315
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:40.040
Hmm...
* groan

316
00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.480
* (LAUGHING)
There really is a hair in here.

317
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.400
You don't want my gifts?
No.

318
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.960
You don't pick up what's on the floor.
you don't pick up. Your membership fee.

319
00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:56.480
Giffey and you claim that Berlin
is the greatest city in the world,

320
00:18:56.800 --> 00:19:00.600
because the SPD has been in
has had government responsibility here for many years. Yes.

321
00:19:00.760 --> 00:19:03.880
No, wait a minute. Mistyped.
Why?

322
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.560
"Although" the SPD has been in
has had government responsibility here for many years.

323
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:12.080
There's a whistle after that,
friends.

324
00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.600
Response.

325
00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:19.720
Berlin is the greatest city
with the greatest people.

326
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.040
Boah,
the old song of the taiga again.

327
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:27.120
But that's all recited.
Do you like Berlin?

328
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.600
No, I hate Berlin. That's why
I have lived here for 45 years.

329
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.000
Great! Are you satisfied? Well.
Do we really want to talk about it?

330
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:37.280
Yes. School.

331
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:41.480
Yes. Yes, schools.
How old are your children?

332
00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:44.560
They're all elementary school age,
High school.

333
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:48.520
There's a lot going on, isn't there?
Yes, but a lot has also been done.

334
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:51.160
And what?
We have relieved the burden on families.

335
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:56.080
The children can eat free of charge ...
Food. First ride the bus and train.

336
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.840
With the card.
29 euros.

337
00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:01.440
It said,
she'll be there in two days.

338
00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.480
For me it took 64 days.
But now it is here.

339
00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:10.120
In this way, we relieve the burden on families.
Many people earn little money.

340
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.640
When the children take the subway ...
It's good, right?

341
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.840
Yes, but how does that
in the school to this,

342
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.560
that they learn better?

343
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:22.440
You need the situation school ...
Or that toilets are renovated.

344
00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:25.760
We put a lot of money into that.
In which toilet?

345
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:29.280
I could make a list
of schools. Do it.

346
00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:32.040
I bring you with me.
Do I bring you?

347
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.240
You left the list at home
on your desk at home?

348
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.960
There it is. No.

349
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:43.360
5.5 billion euros
was invested in the school system.

350
00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.720
If you ask in your district,
many will say:

351
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.200
At the school
was made a canteen,

352
00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.160
there a gym or toilet.

353
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.680
A lot has happened.

354
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.240
That's right, we need to do more.

355
00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.080
But I am against it, Kurt Krömer,
that everything should be badmouthed.

356
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.600
You do like living in the city.
Only 15% of Berliners say:

357
00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.680
"Saleh represents my interests."
Who says that?

358
00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.440
15% of Berliners.
I read that out loud. * (LAUGHING)

359
00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:21.360
Have you been smoking something?
No, I do not smoke.

360
00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.520
Only 15% of Berliners say:
Saleh represents my interests.

361
00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.280
42% don't know you at all.
See?

362
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
That's why I'm on your show.

363
00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:34.640
Hundreds of thousands watch you,
I will become better known.

364
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.360
If 42% don't know you,

365
00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.360
it sucks,
to want to be mayor.

366
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.640
You know what that would be good for?
For hit and run.

367
00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:46.200
* (LAUGHING)
I want to... You know?

368
00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:50.240
"What did the guy look like,
who committed a hit-and-run?"

369
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.360
"I don't know!"

370
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.560
"He's an SPD politician."

371
00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.160
"I don't know! I have looked
the face carefully."

372
00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.680
I would like to become
become state chairman.

373
00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:03.160
What do you want to be?
National chairman.

374
00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:05.680
Together with Franziska Giffey.

375
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.480
* scattered laughter *

376
00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:11.360
State Chair.
How do you get to 15 %?

377
00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.640
This is an Insa survey from 2018.
I see.

378
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.120
Of course, it is possible
that you are now at 15.4 %. Yes, yes.

379
00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.960
After all.
And that 80% don't know you.

380
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:25.080
Probably.

381
00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:29.960
Do you actually have any strengths?
After all, politics isn't one.

382
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:31.840
* (indignant laughter)

383
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:37.720
I like to sing German Schlager,
have in my youth

384
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.040
founded the first
Biene-Maja-Schlagerclub founded.

385
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.160
And in the car ...
Wait, stop.

386
00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.800
Did I just ...
I have ...

387
00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:48.840
Mr. Saleh, I got up today
got up at 6 o'clock.

388
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.600
I thought it was 8 p.m.
and I'm sleep deprived.

389
00:22:53.760 --> 00:22:57.280
I feel bad. Poor bastard.
Just now I understood:

390
00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:59.760
Bee Maya Fan Club.
Can that be?

391
00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.040
I am also under tablets.

392
00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.080
I have founded the
Bee-Maja-Schlagerclub.

393
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:09.440
The Bee-Maja... Objective was
the preservation of the German Lied.

394
00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:12.640
Then I was
overthrown by the brown Burkhardt:

395
00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.160
"I call for the removal
of the non-German president."

396
00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:19.520
You're talking yourself
You're talking out of your ass.

397
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.000
It's not just a room,
there are cameras behind the mirrors.

398
00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:25.080
Do you like pop songs?
* Laughter *

399
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:28.360
Do you like Schlager?
I hate Schlager. Why?

400
00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.960
Schlager is warmth, heart, feeling.
Shall we have a taste?

401
00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.040
I'd rather shoot myself in the head.
* Laughter *

402
00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.560
* Applause *

403
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.320
You love Schlager
and like to sing Schlager.

404
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.920
We can sing together. Your
favorite song: "Mama" by Heintje.

405
00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.280
"Mama" by Heintje ...
Why? Why?

406
00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.160
That is beautiful,
is feeling, motherly love.

407
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.920
I think it's great.
Do you know the song?

408
00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.760
* "Mama" by Heintje *
# Mama

409
00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.760
# You're not supposed to worry about your ...

410
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.000
* Gunshot sound *

411
00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.560
# Mom

412
00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:11.080
# It will be fate
reunite us

413
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.880
Terrible.

414
00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:16.200
Everything okay?
Turn it off!

415
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:19.600
What's up? It's obvious,
that nothing will come of you,

416
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:21.360
if you are ...

417
00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.600
with such music.

418
00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:28.400
Of course you won't!
Don't you like the music? Yes, I do.

419
00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.400
It's terrible.
Mä-mä.

420
00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:35.960
I also like to sing workers' songs.
Yes, but also with mom, huh?

421
00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:39.000
Do you know The Internationale?
It's on the floor.

422
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.520
Leave it. Over there.
Sit down or we'll fix you.

423
00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.120
(LAUGHING) Up ahead, get them.
* (LAUGHING)

424
00:24:48.240 --> 00:24:53.360
(groans) Did your mom cry a lot,
when you joined the SPD?

425
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:58.640
No, she said:
Think it over, boy.

426
00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.320
(snorts) Schlager ...
There he hears the Schlager!

427
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.720
People who listened to
listened to pop songs in high school,

428
00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.680
we beat up.

429
00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:14.760
That wasn't the case with us.
They had a Bambi on their glasses.

430
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:19.320
They were listening to pop songs.
Do you know any beautiful pop songs?

431
00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.360
Do you wear glasses?
(sings) Marble, stone and...

432
00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.840
(groans) Fix and all. Down there ...
I know that's where the presents are.

433
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.720
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
* (indignant laughter)

434
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:36.680
I am not on the take. There lies
also an anti-aggression ball.

435
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.720
A cube to chill out.

436
00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:43.360
* annoyed breathing *

437
00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.520
So now we are serious.
Spandau is considered by far

438
00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.000
as the most boring district in the city.
Veto, veto ...

439
00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:57.200
Do you think that this has
on you? Veto, veto, veto.

440
00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:00.520
Spandau
is a really great district.

441
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.640
With great people, lots of forest,
a lot of green and a lot of water.

442
00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.640
Have you ever been to Spandau?
Yes, in June.

443
00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:12.080
Due to the time difference then
at the Christmas market. * Laughter *

444
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:16.120
Let me take you to Spandau.

445
00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:19.480
(LAUGHS) Great, I'm looking forward to it.
* (LAUGHING)

446
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.720
Didn't you used to have
roll your own cigarettes? No.

447
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:26.880
As a high school student
you worked in a burger joint,

448
00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.840
became branch manager,
then manager of the company,

449
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.160
which operates the Burger stores.

450
00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.240
Ambitious already, aren't you?

451
00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.400
I have worked a lot in life.

452
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.120
When was that?
At Burger King.

453
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.720
I started at 16 ...
McDonald's also exists.

454
00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.560
No, these are the wrong ones.
McDonald's... Are the wrong ones.

455
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.680
I started at Burger King when I was 16

456
00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:51.720
and wanted to support my family
financially support my family.

457
00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.080
I have always worked hard.

458
00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:58.040
And now from the deep fryer
to the chairmanship of the Berlin SPD.

459
00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.800
If it weren't for the SPD:
Success story.

460
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.560
* Laughter *

461
00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.440
Shit happens, doesn't it?

462
00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:08.600
That would be a success story.

463
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:13.760
The time at Burger King
at the deep fryer was the best time.

464
00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.040
I have worked hard
and tried,

465
00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:19.600
the family
to make ends meet.

466
00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:23.600
That was a wonderful time.
We can go there together sometime.

467
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.240
(breathes annoyed) There. So.

468
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.320
Do you also find it so little fun?

469
00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:31.200
The conversation with you?
I think you are great.

470
00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.160
* annoyed breathing *

471
00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.920
Only the cigarette smell
is something ...

472
00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:42.360
You are always so overambitious
in everything you do.

473
00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.440
No, not really. Like
a child cleaning the room,

474
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:49.960
because it thinks that otherwise
Santa Claus won't come. No.

475
00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:52.520
On the contrary.
Yes, it is. M-m.

476
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.360
Do not say no. M-m.

477
00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.040
(breathes in annoyance) There.

478
00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.160
Do you have another question
that you wanted to ask yourself? Yes.

479
00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.080
Why don't you like the gifts?

480
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:10.960
There are nice things in it.
A lunch box.

481
00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.400
I'm still putting these up: As an election target
for the next election to the House of Representatives

482
00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.760
you have given yourself 30%.

483
00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:20.880
You are now at 15.
Want to bet?

484
00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.960
Are you at 15?
Now we are at 15%.

485
00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:25.840
I think we're going to get 30.

486
00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.840
It would be good for you
if you hold this in 30 years.

487
00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.240
That would already be a goal.
You said I'm ambitious.

488
00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:38.000
I want to get to 30%.
You can contribute to that.

489
00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.560
What are you doing? Smoking pot?
* (LAUGHING)

490
00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:46.000
listen to "Mama" and then it comes
on its own? No, work hard.

491
00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:48.840
So, Pinocchio ... Uh, Mr. Saleh.

492
00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.840
We're going to call it a day
and step out again briefly.

493
