00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.360
.

2
00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.240
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.720
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.200
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable #

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.120
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.400
Faisal Kawusi,
31 years old, comedian.

7
00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:26.840
Known only because of
a bad gag on Instagram.

8
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.520
Mr. Kawusi?
Yes?

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.280
I have read through the
read through again.

10
00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.640
This is going to be
a real shit show.

11
00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.400
(laughs) I'm sorry.

12
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.360
There's nothing to it, your
biography would be a loose-leaf binder.

13
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.120
* Kawusi laughs. *

14
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.480
A loose-leaf binder with three pages
and lots and lots of pictures.

15
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.600
Isn't that a good thing?
I think not.

16
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.520
* Krömer sighs. *
Uh-oh.

17
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.080
And I asked for it.

18
00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.280
Hi there.
Moin.

19
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.240
* Krömer sighs. *

20
00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.160
What is this?

21
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.400
So. - Kurt Krömer smokes ...
Pregnancy tests?

22
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.080
Oh, for the feeling.

23
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.120
So, let's be honest ...

24
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.320
People really only know you
because of the shitstorm

25
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.280
after that knockout punch.
You think so? Just that? - Yes.

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.320
There were other things.
What else?

27
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.000
I'm also an influencer.
What do you do there?

28
00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.680
Beautiful photos.

29
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.240
So photos ...
I am very much for body positivity.

30
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.280
People know you from Insta photos.
* Kawusi giggles. *

31
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.200
I think you know me through that.
Please? - Or are we on a first-name basis?

32
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.040
Yeah, you kiss me,
I'd call you by your first name. - Okay.

33
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.920
Mr. Krömer, you have only known me
only since then. - Pardon?

34
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.520
Or did you know me before?
Only after the knockout drop thing.

35
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.120
I thought:
What is this hollow shit?

36
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.840
I thought so too afterwards, yes.
What?

37
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.960
The insight came then? Or ...
Yes, in no time at all.

38
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.520
You were born in southern Hesse,
your parents come from Afghanistan.

39
00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440
You were bullied at school,

40
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.120
until you started
beating up your tormentors.

41
00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.760
Sounds like the origin story
of a super villain.

42
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.560
Was that so?
If you put it that way, yes.

43
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.000
But it was only once, I didn't
I didn't start bullying them.

44
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.480
I was bullied for years
and at some point I exploded.

45
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.360
I beat her up once
and then it was over.

46
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.800
I.e., what worked then,
also works today.

47
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.240
One time you beat up everybody?
Yes.

48
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.000
That was in the third grade.

49
00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.120
Your first real appearance
was in an SM basement.

50
00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.240
What hurt more:

51
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.400
the lashes
or the shitstorms later?

52
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.120
The shitstorms.
There were no whip lashes.

53
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.440
Those were
the nicest people ever.

54
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.240
Is it worth asking,
what went down there?

55
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.720
Is there something coming?
Do you have a story or ...

56
00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.560
I don't know,
whether that makes so much sense.

57
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.080
Then we come to question five.
There is the question of understanding.

58
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.520
You see yourself as the mouthpiece of the
Afghan community in Germany.

59
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.280
Do they even want that?
I think not all of them.

60
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.240
But at least I am one.

61
00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.720
There are hardly any Afghans
in the public eye.

62
00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.800
Did you impose yourself there?

63
00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.720
(laughs) No,
But I get a lot of encouragement.

64
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.840
But hate is much louder than love,

65
00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.960
that's why you're more likely to notice
when people think it sucks.

66
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.840
Then you are
the figurehead for all Afghans

67
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.040
than the guy with the knockout drops?

68
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.320
(laughs) Yes, definitely at the moment.

69
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.400
Is that what you want?
No, I fucked up there.

70
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.120
As an Afghan
I would be ashamed and say:

71
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.800
The willy man
is not my figurehead.

72
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.120
You are 100% right,
but whether they want it or not:

73
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.840
I am and remain
a representative of the whole.

74
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.720
I am also a representative
for fat people in Germany,

75
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.680
whether a good representative
or a bad one.

76
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.760
But I still make an effort.

77
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.640
Your own show,
"The Faisal Kawusi Show" on Sat.1,

78
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.160
was discontinued because of the great success
What? * (LAUGHING)

79
00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.360
Well, according to Sat.1,
because I'm a bad sexist.

80
00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.000
Not because of the quota? - This kind of thing
always happens because of the quota.

81
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.600
Because people
no longer interested?

82
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.200
Yes, you could say that.
Season three, Corona kicks in.

83
00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.720
Was Corona to blame
for the sexist jokes?

84
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.600
No, there were no sexist jokes
sexist jokes.

85
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.840
Not for you? So...

86
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.960
"The Faisal Kawusi Show"
simply did not go down well.

87
00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.560
Luke Mockridge is your buddy.
Do you draw inspiration from him?

88
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.400
With that there was the accusation

89
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.560
the sexualized violence
against his ex-girlfriend.

90
00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.840
Inspire to what?

91
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.600
Well,
you're helping yourself to this one,

92
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.800
get inspired
and imitate it.

93
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.240
No, not really. (laughs)

94
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.320
In April 2022, you got yourself
a shitstorm.

95
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.000
Trigger was
this photo with the extremely ...

96
00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.080
so really very,
very funny text underneath:

97
00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.560
"Have any of you
any of you found eggs?

98
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:29.320
I just got
got some knockout drops."

99
00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.120
Now we have to
the spectators at home

100
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.000
first be laughed at.

101
00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.120
It's been over six months
and still hilarious.

102
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.320
Silvi Carlsson, however, did not find this
not so funny.

103
00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.240
But there you have as a self-proclaimed
grandmaster of comedy,

104
00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.040
which you are:
"I'll go one better on that."

105
00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.720
So, Silvie Carlsson: "I almost died once of
died from knockout drops.

106
00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:06.080
Not cool, Joyce. Again."

107
00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:11.680
Kawusi: "Next time, I'll increase the
I'll up the dose, I promise."

108
00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.640
You gave it to her, didn't you?

109
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:20.280
At that moment, my goal was to
was to upset them.

110
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.160
I have succeeded in doing that.

111
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.200
Whether that was good ...
We all know: definitely no.

112
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.520
But don't you think about it
think about it?

113
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.280
K.-o.-drops are used, after all,
to make women motionless,

114
00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.200
to then rape them.

115
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.600
All right, so ...

116
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.600
Haven't you ever made a gag
about a subject,

117
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.160
that has a very serious
background?

118
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:47.840
(sighs) Yeah, well, I ...

119
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.760
Do you really want to
sit in the ivory tower

120
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.200
and point down and say:
"Kawusi, you're the only one,

121
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.240
who ever made a joke
about a serious subject"?

122
00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.680
I have never made fun of rape victims
I have never made fun of them.

123
00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.480
About diseases yes,
about my own depression ...

124
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.920
But just imagine, out there
someone does not find this funny

125
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:12.240
and says: "You man-hater
make fun of depression!"

126
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.240
Nobody complained about my Afghan war jokes
no one complained about my Afghan war jokes.

127
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:21.080
It is always a question of
what the topic is at the moment.

128
00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.440
And there is just
very sensitively.

129
00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.760
Did you calculate that at home and say
and said, "People have to go through this,

130
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:30.840
we're going to make
Rape victim jokes."?

131
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.080
It is
not a rape victim joke,

132
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.320
but an attack
on Silvi Carlsson.

133
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:38.720
I didn't think that big
and said: Okay, there will be ...

134
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.800
I don't want to joke about this
jokes because it is polarizing.

135
00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:45.600
That was a weak,
human moment of mine.

136
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:48.360
And how much
did I stand up for it?

137
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.600
Name one,
who had the cojones,

138
00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:54.000
to sit down somewhere afterwards,
to justify yourself

139
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.000
And even to say:
"I'm sorry. That wasn't cool."

140
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.640
You do then,

141
00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:02.280
the way of the naked queen
on "Games of Thrones,

142
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.800
who is pelted with shit
and by the mother superior ...

143
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.520
Do you know who you are now?

144
00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:10.200
The queen is already back in the game

145
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.040
and you throw another bunch of
Shit, six months later.

146
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.160
What should we talk about?
Should we leave it out?

147
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.680
No. - I need to address it.
I just wanted to have it said.

148
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.360
Now you are there
and I address it of course.

149
00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:27.160
It's your resume.
It's not my résumé.

150
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.520
There was a spark of my Vita
was picked out and taken apart,

151
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.360
because we can
can point at it with our fingers.

152
00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:37.440
That I came out as a victim of bullying
came out of it,

153
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.520
as a child of a refugee family
have made it,

154
00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:42.400
to become
what I am today,

155
00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.080
not a flawless person,
they do not exist ...

156
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.080
But I was the first Afghan,

157
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:49.720
who came so far
in the entertainment industry.

158
00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:51.760
Many thank me
crying to me,

159
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:55.720
that I am the first representative without
black bars in front of my eyes.

160
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.200
For three seasons.
After all.

161
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:04.360
Isn't that a little unfair?
Please? What?

162
00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:08.440
Humanly, to say, "That's your
Vita." Are you kidding me?

163
00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.920
That's what all the ...
I've had over 2,000 performances.

164
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.240
This is a comment
under a comment on Instagram.

165
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:19.040
That is the only thing you see.
You have ruined everything with it.

166
00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:22.520
True. But that doesn't mean
that it's over now.

167
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:25.440
Life is not over.
Are you doing something else?

168
00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.720
No, I continue to do comedy.

169
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.920
Do you mean,
you can get out of this hole?

170
00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.200
I am out.
After all, it's over.

171
00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:37.080
If I got stuck there, I would be
I would be living in the past.

172
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:40.880
That would keep me from everything
that awaits me in the future.

173
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.200
Sat.1 then made it clear ...

174
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.760
Can I have a water?
Is in the refrigerator.

175
00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.760
... with you
not to work with you anymore.

176
00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.640
You had to take criticism.

177
00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.520
Sat.1 is known for the fact
that they are always very correct.

178
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.440
So it had nothing to do with that,

179
00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.760
that your formats before that
were already doing badly, weren't they?

180
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.880
I'd say Sat.1 has jumped on the
jumped on the bandwagon.

181
00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.360
Considering the fact that ...

182
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.200
Luke Mockridge concrete accusations
and a court action had

183
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.000
and Sat.1 has not distanced itself
has not distanced itself ...

184
00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.240
And with me was enough
a comment under a comment.

185
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.520
I find that quite questionable.
And did you ...

186
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.560
Unfair to you?
Yes, absolutely.

187
00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.080
Should Luke Mockridge have been punished more
or should he have been punished at all?

188
00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:35.600
No ... One should have
a statement earlier.

189
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.920
It seems strange when you
wait three years on the one hand

190
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.720
and with Faisal Kawusi
one comment is enough.

191
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.640
It is and remains a commentary.

192
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.280
Yeah, but it sucked.
Yes, it is like that.

193
00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.520
But it remains a comment.
Yes, but that remains.

194
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.280
If I punch you in the face
and knock out a tooth,

195
00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:57.200
I can make a hundred times
make a good entrance.

196
00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:01.200
People say, "That idiot knocked out one of
Kawusi knocked out a tooth."

197
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.000
That remains.
That this is an eyesore

198
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.920
and will accompany me for the next ten years.
that will accompany me for the next ten years is clear.

199
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.640
Then came the usual remorse number with
appearance on "Stern TV". * Laughter *

200
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.440
"That is also why
I would like to take responsibility here

201
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:19.000
and apologize
apologize from the bottom of my heart.

202
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.920
It was not right. This is not
Faisal. I don't want to be like that."

203
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:26.200
Does that sound like an asshole?

204
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:30.080
No, this is the typical
Regret number. - Typical regret number?

205
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.360
Because the checks are not coming in,
so you have to sit there.

206
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.040
Regret number, Seriously?

207
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.440
Are you really serious?
Yeah, sure. - That was all fake?

208
00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.680
That is the,
what you do ...

209
00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.320
Yes, but now
I stand before you as a human being.

210
00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:47.640
Fuck the
on the whole show business.

211
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.760
Look me in the eye and tell me..,
if you believe,

212
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:52.520
that it was all fake.

213
00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:57.240
I think that's a
regret number that you pull off.

214
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.760
Whether or not that's true. - Is everyone like that
or would you do it that way?

215
00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.480
After you have done the duty,

216
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.880
apologized nicely and sadly
apologized,

217
00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:09.600
The grass has grown over the matter,
you thought:

218
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.120
Now I can
carry on as before.

219
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:18.000
So ...
"I'm so knocked out by the sun."

220
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:21.400
In the corner below:
"And that without drops."

221
00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.200
It doesn't look like
as if you have learned anything

222
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.040
from the poop,
which one has already made.

223
00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:32.920
That one more time
next to the turd.

224
00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:36.680
Okay, we need to define
who sees what as a turd.

225
00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:40.240
You see the gag as a turd,
I see the intention.

226
00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.160
But you just said,

227
00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:45.640
you were wrong
and that the action was shit.

228
00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.280
And then comes something like this?

229
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.400
Everyone sees something different there.
This does not make sense.

230
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.400
Everybody hears
what he wants to hear.

231
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:56.760
From the very beginning
first and foremost about the intention.

232
00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.520
But that is not insight.

233
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.960
Now we are back to the
Regret number ... - Wait, wait.

234
00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:07.280
That is the reflection of
of oneself, what one sees in it.

235
00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.800
Somebody fucks up, goes to Stern TV
to Stern TV and says "I'm sorry."

236
00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.480
And then you do
the same shit again.

237
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.520
Exactly not. - And just now
you're still saying that was real.

238
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:22.160
Just not, it goes ... Good.
How stupid can you be?

239
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.400
(laughs) It is and remains
a question of intention.

240
00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.120
But thanks for listening.

241
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.480
Also the poster of your tour
speaks volumes

242
00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:35.440
and recalls the fatal
arrest of George Floyd in 2020.

243
00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.440
So, on the left is almost one died

244
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.000
and right
one goes unsuccessfully on tour.

245
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.640
He died.
Yes.

246
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.840
And what was the intention there?

247
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.360
(sighs) There is no intention.

248
00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:55.960
I want to let the art
speak for itself.

249
00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.320
With art, everyone can interpret
what he sees in it.

250
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.000
What do you see?
Something positive, I'm sure.

251
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.840
(sighs) I don't know,

252
00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.240
whether this is meant to irritate
or is simply in bad taste.

253
00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.560
For me it is
kind of tasteless.

254
00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:17.680
Let's say,
you leave out the left image,

255
00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.360
puts you behind bars
and it says "public enemy no. 1,

256
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:25.000
because the cunts up there
don't see me the way I am",

257
00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.960
then that would have something.

258
00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.480
Then you have the enemy up there,
the one with the big balls.

259
00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:35.680
Here it is,
you said "my intention"....

260
00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.120
Maybe it is exactly that,
only with a different interpretation.

261
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.840
Then make it so that
Lieschen Müller from Kuhmannsdorf

262
00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.320
also understands this when she
drives past the poster at 120 km/h.

263
00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:49.120
Then my name would be Kurt Krömer,
but it is not.

264
00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.840
Neither is yours, by the way.

265
00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.080
Yes ...
* (LAUGHS) *

266
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.600
You can out me,
that it's a stage name.

267
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.520
But I do celebrate fingernails.
Yes, me too.

268
00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.120
Anti-gay too?
No. - No.

269
00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.200
I am not hostile to anything.

270
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.000
Motsi Mabuse
you have racially insulted.

271
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.200
At the "1Live Cologne Comedynight XXL"
you asked,

272
00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.600
whether Motsi Mabuse could understand the apes in the film
"Planet of the Apes" could understand,

273
00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:19.240
even if the
only make animal sounds.

274
00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.880
Now you should answer.

275
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.120
I did not hear a question.

276
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.960
Motsi Mabuse you have
racist insults.

277
00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.280
At the "1Live Cologne Comedynight XXL"
you asked,

278
00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:39.920
whether Motsi Mabuse could understand the apes in the film
"Planet of the Apes" could understand,

279
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.480
even if they only
animal sounds.

280
00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.600
Did you racially insult Motsi Mabuse
a racist insult?

281
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:51.360
(sighs) I didn't want to, but
obviously I did.

282
00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.560
Do you have a genetic defect or
something is not running cleanly upstairs,

283
00:15:56.720 --> 00:16:00.160
that things shoot out of you,
that you only realize later,

284
00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.960
when the press is full of it,
that it was crap?

285
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.480
You go into a bank,
shoot the guy

286
00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:10.360
and then say:
"Hands up, or I'll shoot!"?

287
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.120
(sighs) I would say,
I am a human being.

288
00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:18.640
More suspicious are people who pretend
as if they do not make mistakes.

289
00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.240
But here everything is full
with errors. - I see only two.

290
00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.360
Your argument is always,
that people,

291
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.960
who laugh at such things,
not... who... (sighs)

292
00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:35.720
who do not laugh at such things,
have no sense of humor.

293
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.520
Ever thought,
that it's just not funny?

294
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.560
Then they would
simply not laugh.

295
00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:44.920
It's okay,
not to find something funny.

296
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:47.960
Not everyone finds you funny either.
No.

297
00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.440
But does that make it okay
to beat me up?

298
00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.440
So from me ...

299
00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.760
When I'm on stage
and there is an audience,

300
00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:58.880
it is my job
to make people laugh.

301
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:04.000
Certainly on my level,
I don't... don't slime myself.

302
00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:08.600
But it is my job
to make people laugh.

303
00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:11.800
I can't say, "They're
stupid if they don't laugh."

304
00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.600
I do not say,
they are stupid.

305
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.000
I mean the taste ...
But I do not count that kind of thing.

306
00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.280
That's what I mean in general.
Wouldn't it have made more sense,

307
00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.600
to make fun of Nazis?

308
00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:27.360
That you can smash them in the face
and can say at the end:

309
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.640
Now I have even
done something good?

310
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:33.120
I do that often enough, too.

311
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.080
I do not determine
a certain group of people,

312
00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.920
that I make fun of.

313
00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:42.920
Do you still steal gags
from your colleagues? * (LAUGHING)

314
00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.120
Don't worry,
I only steal from good comedians.

315
00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.360
In 2015 you
Parts of your program

316
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.360
1:1 from comedian
Russell Peters took over ...

317
00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.000
Coming soon,

318
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.960
that I stole 5 euros from the
from the secretary's cash box.

319
00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:03.200
Well, we left that out,
because it was so little.

320
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.160
... without making this clear.

321
00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.920
When it became public,

322
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.040
you returned the Hamburg Comedy Award
and the prize money.

323
00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:15.160
Annoying when something like this comes out,
what? * loud laughter *

324
00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.560
How long ago was this? 2015?
Yes. - Yes, is quite annoying.

325
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:26.360
What does annoying mean ...
also unpleasantly simple.

326
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.680
Because that was a long time ago?
No, that always remains unpleasant.

327
00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:34.840
In 2008 I pushed a granny
down the basement stairs.

328
00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.880
Is no longer unpleasant?
No, because it was so long ago.

329
00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.760
Is that the reasoning? - No,
I'm still uncomfortable with it.

330
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:46.560
Also with Afghan comedians
you should help yourself

331
00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:49.800
and their programs
simply translate into German.

332
00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.360
Can you still enter the country at all?
This is the first time I've heard that.

333
00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.320
Who made that claim?
Who is the source?

334
00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.000
That's what we've been researching.
Where?

335
00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.960
We have a suggestion for you
... - Wait, where is the source?

336
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.600
Everything that has come so far
has been appropriate.

337
00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.000
Pass me the source.
We'll watch the video.

338
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:16.480
Also an Afghani comedian, from whom
you might be able to steal from.

339
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:19.320
* Title melody

340
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:22.760
* Applause and music *

341
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.560
This is Shabkhandi.

342
00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.920
* He starts to talk. *

343
00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:35.560
* Audience laughs. *

344
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.840
He does it just right,
he steals from the best.

345
00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:44.560
I don't understand.
* Cough *

346
00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:46.200
What's the point?

347
00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.480
Please?

348
00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.560
What gag?

349
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.520
The stage design?
I was just curious.

350
00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.360
What was that now?

351
00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.880
The stage design?
What kind of stage design?

352
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.720
Can we see again
the last 3 seconds?

353
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.760
An Afghan comedian
for Kabel 1 ...

354
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.520
Kabul 1?

355
00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.040
It's not funny, he's dead.

356
00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.320
* Applause and music *

357
00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.120
So, now let's do ...

358
00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:28.320
* He starts to talk. *

359
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.000
* Audience laughs. *

360
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.360
So.

361
00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:37.600
What is this?
And there you can see Kurt Krömer now.

362
00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.720
And someone
has stolen a stage set.

363
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:46.280
So, anyway...
Oh, that's the gag.

364
00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:49.440
2015 in the WORLD,
that was our source.

365
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:51.480
Yeah, okay ...

366
00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.680
Not that I know of. - Then we wouldn't have
we wouldn't have had to pick it out.

367
00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.440
(laughs)
It's also simply not true.

368
00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:03.280
You are accused of
your jokes consist of clichés

369
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:05.720
and stereotypes,
especially about minorities.

370
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:07.760
Why do you always step down?

371
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.440
What, downstairs?
Below.

372
00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:13.800
Where do you see me,
the Afghan refugee child?

373
00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.000
Am I at the top of the food chain?

374
00:21:16.480 --> 00:21:19.560
Yes, but if you make
racist remarks...

375
00:21:19.720 --> 00:21:21.640
I am a Kanake myself.

376
00:21:21.800 --> 00:21:25.080
That doesn't give you any reason
to make racist jokes.

377
00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.920
No, that's not what I mean.

378
00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:30.720
What does "kicking down" mean?
That is a typical victim attitude.

379
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:34.120
Yes, it is a minority.
Why minority?

380
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.240
Am I not a minority?
Are you kidding me?

381
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.680
You're a minority, sure.
Of course.

382
00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.800
How can I step down,
when it's on one level?

383
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:46.160
You step from one minority
to the other minority.

384
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:50.080
What a bullshit.
Motsi Mabuse would have laughed at that,

385
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.440
it would have been all right.

386
00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:54.520
But what then "step down"?

387
00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:56.160
Then one would claim,

388
00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.840
that the Black community is among
is the Afghan community.

389
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.520
If you make a poster with Floyd
that's also a minority.

390
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:08.120
Why don't you laugh at the cops who killed him?
policemen who killed him?

391
00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:10.560
That was not a gag,
you didn't get it.

392
00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:13.040
It is about the term
"step down".

393
00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.800
What kind of bullshit is that?
Honestly?

394
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.000
The woman who almost died from knockout drops...
almost died ...

395
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.200
Who creates this table?
Who is at the top ...

396
00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:25.400
People lying down.
That's up to each person to decide.

397
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.800
If there is one lying there ... - Have you seen
the Stern TV interview?

398
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.880
Have you seen it in its entirety?
"As a German, I can do that"?

399
00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.920
Have you seen
my Stern TV interview?

400
00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.720
Or are you just the clown
who reads off? - Excerpts.

401
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.640
Did you get the most important info
at the end?

402
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.840
I'm reading things here
from six people.

403
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:50.400
We create this together
and then I read it aloud.

404
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.480
But did you hear the end?
Diggi, watch out. - Diggi?

405
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:56.760
You're stepping down on minorities.

406
00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:59.720
I have myself once
I was given knockout drops myself.

407
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.480
Step down in what way?

408
00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.920
They also had
no longer have an answer.

409
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:08.440
You took knockout drops ...
No, who takes something like that?

410
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:10.800
* Krömer groans. *

411
00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:18.360
Good, I don't feel like it anymore.
No kidding, neither do I.

412
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.720
Yes. - I was undecided.
I thought it could be cool.

413
00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.560
I've been thinking all day
that it was going to suck. - Why?

414
00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.920
Didn't you say you don't want to invite
you don't want to invite people you hate anymore?

415
00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.400
We have only assholes,
including you only assholes.

416
00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.400
I have read your book, there you
you made a different impression.

417
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:40.440
Do you think I'm going to write
a book about my depression

418
00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.920
or have them treated away
and then understand racists?

419
00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.600
What is this shit?

420
00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.040
Treat away,
what kind of bullshit are you talking?

421
00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.160
Depression is treated away.

422
00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:54.400
Yes, but so negative,
as you are...

423
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.640
Because you're full of shit!

424
00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.680
You're full of shit.
And that means?

425
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.880
That you can fuck off now.

426
00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.520
Now?
Yes.

427
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.400
Hm.
Come.

428
00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.640
* Krömer groans. *

429
00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:16.280
Today is not a good day, huh?
No.

430
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.480
Was yesterday a good day?

431
00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.280
Today was private actually
a very nice day,

432
00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.240
but the vomit chunks came up
when I entered the station.

433
00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:26.880
Good, then not because of me.

434
00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:29.880
Then we have namely
put together the questions.

435
00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:35.200
(sighs) Fine,
you can stay here, too.

436
00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:40.840
Thanks for the drink.
Yes, please.

437
00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.800
Whoa.

438
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:57.120
* Kawusi sighs. *

439
00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:02.000
Good idea.
Today is such a day,

440
00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.360
where I go home and
rethink the concept.

441
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.120
"Treating away depression" ...
Of course.

442
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.840
I have to listen to the shit
to listen to.

443
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.360
It was clear to me that this could still
was clear to me.

444
00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.880
Mr. Meier,
how long do we have?

445
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:43.640
* Kawusi groans. *

446
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:48.640
Is Mr. Meier still there?

447
00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:51.840
(man) 2:30.

448
00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:04.280
* Kawusi laughs. *

449
00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:08.000
But he laughs,
that's nice.

450
00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:10.840
Then at least
at least someone had fun.

451
00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:18.840
I'm not going to do the time.
I am going home.

452
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.720
* Music starts. *

453
00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.200
(man) Awkward.

454
00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.040
# You are the one for me, for me

455
00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.640
# For me, formidable

456
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.400
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

457
00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:58.720
# Et je voudrais
Pouvoir un jour enfin te le dire #

458
00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:01.560
Can I go now too?
Or...

459
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.640
# Dans la langue de Shakespeare

460
00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.160
# My daisy, daisy

461
00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.000
# Daisy, desirable

462
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:14.640
# Je suis malheureux

463
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.040
# D'avoir si peu de mots
A t'offrir en cadeau

464
00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:21.920
# Darling I love you, love you

465
00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.920
# Darling I want you

466
00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:26.520
# Et puis c'est a peu pres tout

467
00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.600
# You are the one for me

468
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:32.920
# For me, for me, formidable #

469
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.360
Man, that was fun!

470
00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:39.240
* He laughs. *

471
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.600
Holy shit.

472
00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:48.640
I really thought
it could be cool.

473
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.000
Such a small ...
Probability.
