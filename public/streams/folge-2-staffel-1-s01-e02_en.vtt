00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.120
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.480
*Groans*

4
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.240
Gereon Rath,
I can never get rid of you, can I?

5
00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.160
KÃ¶nig did not destroy the movie.
- That was the instruction.

6
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.320
Krajewski? He used to be with us.
Police officer.

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:21.760
Thought seriously,

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.720
after the war
back into service as normal.

9
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.440
Where is the movie?

10
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.680
You have no idea,
who you're dealing with.

11
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.400
Our mutual friend does business
business on his own account.

12
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.800
*uncanny music

13
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.320
*uncanny music

14
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.880
Greetings, King.

15
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.920
What do you want?

16
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.560
Pray.

17
00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:16.840
Mr. ...

18
00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.160
God, who is vengeance,

19
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.880
appear.

20
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.880
*dark music*

21
00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.120
Repeat after me.

22
00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.880
You are my Lord and God.

23
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.160
(choking)
You are my Lord and God.

24
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.520
You watch over me.
- You watch over me.

25
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.320
Even in the darkness
of my dungeon ...

26
00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.760
Even in the darkness
of my dungeon ...

27
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.920
... I know your stern hand
over me.

28
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.480
... I know your stern hand
over me.

29
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.600
Your anger is just.

30
00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.960
(softly) Your anger is just.

31
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.160
Your revenge is terrible.

32
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.400
*He breathes frantically.
Your revenge is terrible.

33
00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.800
*sob*

34
00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.480
*ringing*

35
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.480
(removed) Berliner Morgenpost!

36
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680
I'm sorry.

37
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.280
But when a picture
is so destroyed ...

38
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.120
If you had the negative,
then I could do something.

39
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.600
But I didn't.

40
00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.480
Was that a professional
photographer, i.e. a cameraman?

41
00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.840
Why?
It is very thinly exposed.

42
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.240
A miracle,
that you recognize something.

43
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.920
The recording
was made secretly.

44
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.640
Good when this is finished,

45
00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.440
Where can I take it,
Commissioner?

46
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.320
I'll take it right away.

47
00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.440
And uh Mr. ...

48
00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.320
Count.

49
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.800
Not a word to anyone.

50
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.280
You have never seen this picture.

51
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.400
*whistle*
Gereon!

52
00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.320
I've got something for you.

53
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.800
Yes, our 14 is on the ball.

54
00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.520
Straight down into the shaft,

55
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.360
Barrel adjusted, blown through,
everything perfect.

56
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.560
Bruno? We can also
together.

57
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.880
I'm not going to get involved.

58
00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.240
Don't worry.

59
00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.960
*Wolter farts.

60
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.560
It has to go,
what doesn't pay rent.

61
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.000
Recommend me.

62
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.280
Where is the movie?

63
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.320
Come on.

64
00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.600
Blackmail is
too big for you.

65
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.880
Tell me,
who your clients are

66
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.520
and where the movie is,
then you are free.

67
00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.920
*exciting music*

68
00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.360
(hoarse) I need some fresh air.

69
00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.400
Please.

70
00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.560
I can't breathe.

71
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.480
Very good idea. And now?

72
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:06.480
Close your eyes.

73
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.920
And then?

74
00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.720
You're not getting out of here.

75
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.240
Not alive.

76
00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:17.160
Close your eyes!

77
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.360
Think, King.

78
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:23.400
We're not
after you.

79
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.440
You have nothing to fear.

80
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.200
Close your eyes!

81
00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360
No.

82
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:33.760
No!

83
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.480
*pulsating music

84
00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.360
*He breathes frantically.

85
00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.800
*drumming music*

86
00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.400
*hectic breathing*

87
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.440
What happened?
Can you hear me?

88
00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.960
*incomprehensible*
What?

89
00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.360
I can't understand you.
Inside pocket.

90
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.680
Is that what you want?

91
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.400
How many? One?

92
00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.280
Good?

93
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.520
More.

94
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:05.680
*He breathes more calmly.

95
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.200
I'll get help.

96
00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:19.400
Please.

97
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.760
But you are bleeding.

98
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.400
That's not mine.

99
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.160
*He groans.

100
00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.520
Am I in the wrong place or are you?

101
00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.560
Do you know how many toilets
there are for men here?

102
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.120
52.

103
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.200
And how many for women?

104
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:01.840
May I ask you something?

105
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.920
I already understood that.

106
00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.320
Yes?

107
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.760
I am Charlotte Ritter.

108
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.120
Rath, Gereon.

109
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:20.000
Gereon? Where do you come from?
From the Middle Ages?

110
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.240
From Cologne.

111
00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.000
I can manage on my own.

112
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.840
Are you sure?

113
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.800
Yes.

114
00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.840
Good.

115
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:37.200
I'll close the door, okay?

116
00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.760
*croaking horn*

117
00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.240
*She sighs.
Drive, please.

118
00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.160
*You speak Russian.

119
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.320
*moving music

120
00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.200
Interview to Cologne.

121
00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:52.400
1308 Thank you.

122
00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.720
(Yes, please?

123
00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.120
It's me.

124
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.800
Gereon.

125
00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.480
Can you speak?

126
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.200
Yes.

127
00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.960
King is dead.

128
00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.920
Do you have the material?
 No.

129
00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.320
Just a single image.
What, no movie?

130
00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.640
Not yet.

131
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.640
You know
what responsibility you have.

132
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.800
You have to destroy the movie.

133
00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.600
No one must know
that he exists.

134
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.840
Gereon!

135
00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:29.200
Man, where have you been?

136
00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:34.200
What was going on?

137
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.680
He grabbed
He grabbed my gun.

138
00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.280
We are expected.

139
00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:43.360
From whom?

140
00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.760
Political department.

141
00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:47.400
Benda?

142
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.000
In person. Come!

143
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:54.840
*disturbing music*

144
00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.840
Yes, I see.

145
00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.800
Yes, of course.

146
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:10.320
Listen again.

147
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.240
Wolter, Rath.
We are expected.

148
00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:18.520
Please.

149
00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.120
Mr. Government Councillor.

150
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:28.320
How could you allow
this to happen?

151
00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.400
They knew King after all.

152
00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.680
They have been following the man for weeks.

153
00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.760
You had to know,
what he's capable of.

154
00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.440
He is at no time
negligent with ...

155
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.680
You're not needed here at the moment
not in demand here, Wolter.

156
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.400
You interrogated him yesterday?
Yes, with the chief inspector.

157
00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.240
Yesterday afternoon.

158
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:51.720
And the wounds?
Please?

159
00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.120
It says here,
that King yesterday

160
00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:59.120
with injuries at the remand
prison with injuries.

161
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:03.480
Where did they come from?
He had tried to escape.

162
00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.720
I see.

163
00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.000
If you will excuse us,
gentlemen.

164
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.640
Mr. Wolter,
in private, please.

165
00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.720
Please take a seat, Commissioner.

166
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.280
It would be fatal in your situation,

167
00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.800
if you
would withhold something from me.

168
00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.600
I am aware of that.

169
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.600
I spoke to Cologne earlier
on the phone.

170
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:50.920
Your father said that you would
would explain the facts.

171
00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:55.440
The Lord Mayor of Cologne
is being blackmailed.

172
00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:59.120
Dr. Adenauer,
my highest employer.

173
00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:03.760
The matter is unappetizing,
should be settled before the election.

174
00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.800
Blackmailed ...

175
00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.320
From KÃ¶nig?

176
00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.800
I knew KÃ¶nig.

177
00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:11.920
A conceited,
arrogant guy.

178
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.440
Until this morning.

179
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:16.360
He was changed,
as if changed.

180
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.640
In other words?

181
00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.480
I believe
there is a client.

182
00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720
Here in Berlin.

183
00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.840
Where is the movie?
Do you already have a lead?

184
00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.440
Yes.

185
00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.480
Good.

186
00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:30.520
Don't waste any time.

187
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.520
And because of this incident
with King:

188
00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:36.760
The apparatus in the castle,
the press and Wolter,

189
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.400
You leave that to me.
Cigarette?

190
00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:41.160
With pleasure.

191
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:44.880
Her father mentioned,

192
00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.880
that there is a personal connection
to Dr. Adenauer?

193
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.600
My mother died
died immediately after the war.

194
00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:57.560
From the Spanish flu.

195
00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:03.120
Dr. Adenauer was very committed to the
interests of the relatives.

196
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.280
He was my father and also me

197
00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:09.000
a strong support
in a very difficult time.

198
00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.720
Where are you staying?

199
00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.920
Not at all since this morning.
My hotel is fully booked.

200
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:17.920
Let's take care of it.

201
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:22.200
Are you Catholic?

202
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.480
Yes.

203
00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:25.720
*Typewriter clacks.

204
00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:29.160
(Benda) Why don't you come
to mass on Sunday morning.

205
00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.440
St. Antonius, Friedenau.
I play the organ.

206
00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.400
And you, Mr. Wolter,

207
00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:37.960
get our colleague
a decent room.

208
00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.880
For longer.
Shall be.

209
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:45.640
*cheerful swing music*

210
00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.880
Behnke.

211
00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.000
Elisabeth!
This is Bruno.

212
00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.280
I need a room.
From when?

213
00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.160
Preferably immediately.

214
00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:56.200
The balcony room
has just become available.

215
00:18:56.440 --> 00:19:00.160
But I still have to finish it.
It's a colleague of mine.

216
00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:03.160
Thank you, Bruno.
Send the gentleman over to me.

217
00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:05.840
In two hours
the room will be ready.

218
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.920
*cheerful swing music*

219
00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:22.400
Six marks a week.

220
00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:25.520
If you rent for a month,
it'll be cheaper.

221
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.480
But that explains everything
Elisabeth.

222
00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.360
Who?
Your landlady.

223
00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.760
A widow of a comrade.

224
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.800
*He whistles.
JÃ¤nicke!

225
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.120
You're going to
to your new place.

226
00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.360
And tomorrow night you'll eat with us.
Good. Thank you.

227
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.400
(Yes?
Can you drive a car?

228
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.400
Excuse me?
Drive a car? Hum.

229
00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:48.400
Yes.

230
00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:53.120
Company car. You take
the suitcase, the inspector,

231
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.640
bring both
to the Bayreuth 25.

232
00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:58.400
You bring the car back
back washed.

233
00:19:58.640 --> 00:19:59.720
Yes.

234
00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:02.680
Why are you standing here like a seven of spades?
Off!

235
00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.680
It's good that everything works
works so well.

236
00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:19.960
I'll take that one.
 Thank you.

237
00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.400
*serious music

238
00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:30.120
Why don't you take me to
to Hermannplatz first.

239
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.560
Right now?

240
00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:33.800
Yes, please.

241
00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:46.800
I'm with Wolter.
 All right.

242
00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:58.600
Kss! Mouserich!
Warm up a little, huh?

243
00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.840
Police.

244
00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:01.880
So what? They're cold too.

245
00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880
Hmm?

246
00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.840
Okay.

247
00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.840
Where is the other one?

248
00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:21.320
It's my shift.
Come with me.

249
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.520
Have you heard?
 Of course you have.

250
00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:28.000
Word gets around in no time.

251
00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.560
King was nobody,
who kills himself.

252
00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.280
Who is afraid
that the king will sing?

253
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:39.000
The ... Emperor?

254
00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.320
King was a secretive man.

255
00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.240
Nobody knew
who he was making the films for.

256
00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:49.320
But he has earned well.

257
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:03.800
Where did you record this?
Who are the women?

258
00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.640
That one. I know her.
 Which one?

259
00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:14.400
That one.

260
00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.000
This is ...

261
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.480
Mom from Wedding.

262
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.000
*exciting music*

263
00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.680
*You speak Russian.

264
00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:34.720
*threatening music

265
00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.960
Thank you, JÃ¤nicke.

266
00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:11.280
(Elisabeth)
So, come on in.

267
00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:15.240
Breakfast at half past six,
Dinner extra.

268
00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:16.840
That's at six,

269
00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.520
warm on Sundays and Wednesdays,
otherwise dinner.

270
00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.240
I make the bed linen,

271
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.880
towels and so on
take care of yourself.

272
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.960
The balcony
is for your free use.

273
00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.320
But please ventilate regularly!

274
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.760
Ah, that's what I call luck!

275
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.400
Are you superstitious?

276
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:41.000
No, you?
No.

277
00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:51.280
I'll take the room.
Weekly or monthly?

278
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.720
Weekly.
 Good.

279
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.720
The first three weeks
only against prepayment.

280
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.120
Mr. Katelbach!
Please excuse me.

281
00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.360
Mr. Katelbach!
- Yes?

282
00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:04.480
Take a look at the calendar!
End of the month.

283
00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.800
One day longer
and you move out.

284
00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.400
Dear Mrs. Elisabeth,

285
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:11.720
I have something
something very special for you:

286
00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:15.600
in three hours special performance
at the Admiralspalast.

287
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.160
A Jatz opera like the other day? Nope.
They don't ventilate!

288
00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.520
*muffled voices from next door*

289
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:26.800
(I want my rent!
- As soon as I'm back from Vienna.

290
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.800
And who pays for the trip?
- My publisher.

291
00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.880
(Katelbach) The new government
in Vienna serves itself,

292
00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:36.560
a man from the Middle Ages
to become chancellor.

293
00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.240
When do you pay?

294
00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.800
As soon as my gloss has been printed.
- And if it is not printed?

295
00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.920
That, dear Mrs. Elisabeth,
would be a conjunctivus irrealis.

296
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.960
An impossibility.
However ...

297
00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.680
Would it perhaps be possible
of this surely delicious s...?

298
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.720
First pay, then eat.

299
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.400
Said the executioner to the condemned man.

300
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.000
Recommend me.
Dearest servant.

301
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.240
Have the honor.

302
00:26:08.800 --> 00:26:09.800
Journalist?

303
00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:12.440
Austrian snob.

304
00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:14.520
What's on the menu?
Dumplings.

305
00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.720
And with us?

306
00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.800
What do you think?
Dead grandma.

307
00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.360
With or without?

308
00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.240
Without you? That would be nice.

309
00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:25.760
Pull the cord,
we need briquettes!

310
00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.720
Fucking women!

311
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.960
For God's sake, Karlchen,
off to the bank!

312
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.480
Do I have to
comb it into your forehead?

313
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.800
March!

314
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.800
What's the matter with you today
run over your liver today?

315
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.600
Haven't slept a wink all night
not a wink of sleep.

316
00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:48.560
Mother was coughing,
Erich threw up,

317
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.680
Grandpa went to bed,
Magda screamed,

318
00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.800
Karlchen had diarrhea.

319
00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:57.160
And Lotte wasn't there.
But I got the sausage.

320
00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:05.120
How was school?
Nothing really.

321
00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.640
*barking cough*

322
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.880
You weren't there, were you?
Probably!

323
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:17.000
You were in the spinning mill.
Just a few hours.

324
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.920
They had a breakdown.

325
00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:20.440
How much?
 1,50.

326
00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:22.280
And who's got it?
 Well, Ilse.

327
00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:23.880
When you go to work,

328
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.920
you can't keep up at school
at school, Toni.

329
00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.360
Done! Like new, ma'am.

330
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.240
Don't get distracted, madame!

331
00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.120
(Woman, weak) Poppi!

332
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.400
Yes, mother?

333
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.240
You have to rub it in.
With rubbing alcohol.

334
00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:42.400
*barking cough*

335
00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.920
Grandpa!

336
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.640
*Baby cries.

337
00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.640
(quantity) ... your money,
and soon the world will be ours!

338
00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.680
Banks are eating your money,
and soon we will own the world!

339
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.760
Banks are eating your money,
and soon we will own the world!

340
00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.800
Banks are eating your money,
and soon we will own the world!

341
00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:16.600
*floating dance music

342
00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:19.120
Evening, Charlotte!
Evening.

343
00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:20.920
Thank you.

344
00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.960
*Music, babble of voices, laughter*

345
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:32.960
Hello there!

346
00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.400
Do you put it on?

347
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.800
Thank you.

348
00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:01.400
You or none.

349
00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:21.600
*Bell rings.

350
00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.320
(in Cologne dialect)
Ah, the holy Gereon of KÃ¶lle!

351
00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.600
Good evening, Mr. DÃ¶hmann.
Robert, will you do me a favor?

352
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.320
Will you leave your master and mistress
alone with the Commissioner?

353
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:37.400
Turn the sign over, will you?
- Will do.

354
00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.960
Well then ...

355
00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.280
So, when are you going
back home?

356
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.760
Soon, I hope.

357
00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:49.800
Yes, and I hope so,
that you have the recipe for me.

358
00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:55.360
Thank you.

359
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.720
Yes, yes, you have it good,
You still have hope.

360
00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.640
But I will probably
until the end of my life

361
00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.640
among these frigid
Berlin bulettes exist.

362
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.640
What have I done to deserve this?

363
00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.400
Just because I married a Charlottenburger
got married.

364
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.480
How can you be so stupid!

365
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.800
They act so freely,

366
00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:19.360
but against a real Cologne moo
you can forget them all.

367
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.880
Here. Ten milligrams maximum.
Oral. That's two a day.

368
00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:27.840
Nothing more.
Otherwise you'll get hooked.

369
00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.200
(in Cologne dialect)
All I want is peace and quiet.

370
00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.760
Silence! At your age?
You should be ashamed of yourself.

371
00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.800
Have a nice evening.

372
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.600
Yes, the same.

373
00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.760
*whispering laugh*

374
00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.280
*He grunts.

375
00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.680
What is that?

376
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.440
*fast music

377
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.440
My dear friend
and engraver!

378
00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:28.200
The women!

379
00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.840
Look around you! They are everywhere.

380
00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:34.760
Women, women, women.

381
00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.800
You don't know where to look,
where to look.

382
00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:39.280
I do.

383
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:42.560
That one?

384
00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.480
Is that your bitch?

385
00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:47.680
Well, you can't say that
now, but ...

386
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.560
She doesn't know anything yet
of her good fortune?

387
00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.960
Hold this!

388
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:01.400
Hey!

389
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.600
Glass of fizzy drink?

390
00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.400
Thank you.

391
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.640
My friend sent me.

392
00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:15.480
Ah yes, I know him.
He feels incapable.

393
00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.120
But not you, or what?
Hm ...

394
00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.560
(Mesdames and Messieurs ...

395
00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.560
Does he dance?
Of course he does.

396
00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.120
Hold this!

397
00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:26.240
Tell me, any other wishes?

398
00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:29.600
(Say hello to me:
Le Grand Nikoros!

399
00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.840
Goodbye, you were wonderful. Come on!

400
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:36.240
We have to meet again.
Absolutely.

*Singing with an accent*
To ashes, to dust,

404
00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.920
robbed of the light.

405
00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.400
But not yet.

406
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:20.680
*The crowd joins in.
Miracles wait until the end.

407
00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:29.720
Ocean of time,

408
00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.320
eternal law.

409
00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.520
To ashes, to dust.

410
00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.880
To ashes.

411
00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:42.400
But not yet.

412
00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:12.440
To ashes, to dust.

413
00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.280
Robbed of the light.

414
00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.960
But not yet.

415
00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.880

(sings) It's probably just a dream,

418
00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:43.640
the mere chasing of the wind.

419
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.520
Who knows for sure?

420
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.320
The clock on your wall,

421
00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.440
it is filled with sand.

422
00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.520
Put your hand in mine

423
00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:03.840
and let us be eternal.

424
00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:07.880
You now make your choice

425
00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.680
and throw us
between happiness and agony.

426
00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:16.520
But I can forgive you.

427
00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.960
You are so close to death,

428
00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:26.160
but your gaze is so clear,

429
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:32.920
he recognizes me, I am ready
and seek immortality with you.

430
00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.800
Do you know your way around? Everything clear?
You got it.

Mmm. Good work, comrades.
