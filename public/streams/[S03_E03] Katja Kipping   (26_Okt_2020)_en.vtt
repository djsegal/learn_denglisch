00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.120
.

2
00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.400
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.760
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:12.520
# You are my love
very, very, veritable

5
00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.880
* (clears throat)

6
00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.320
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.120
Katja Kipping, 42 years old,

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.160
since 2012 Federal Chairwoman
of the Left Party.

9
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.520
She will not be standing for
will not run for the chairmanship again.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.000
Ms. Kipping,
are you ready? - Yes.

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.280
What do you,
when you hand over the chairmanship of the party,

12
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.800
are unemployed,
watching Netflix first, right?

13
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.640
Nah, that's just an honorary office
with us, party chairwoman.

14
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.520
I am a normal deputy

15
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.720
and continue
continue my specialist political work.

16
00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.360
So nothing.

17
00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.360
Chill, grill, box kill.

18
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.560
You know all about that
- with doing nothing.

19
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.600
If someone is taking the piss here,
it's me.

20
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.360
I'm not so fond of that.

21
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.320
Spikes against me
are not welcome.

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520
But like to hear?

23
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.680
Quite cheeky.

24
00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.880
Yes, such a party can also be
be a tough school.

25
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.680
* Door buzzer *

26
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.160
So, here I am.
Hello.

27
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.520
Do you want a drink?

28
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.400
What's the matter with you?
Excuse me, train. * (clears throat)

29
00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.880
We have water with and without.
Then I'll take without.

30
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.080
Take the opened one,
that one goes away.

31
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.560
Ah, I suspected,
that her hosting skills...

32
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.760
Do you have the Gerolsteiner ...
Therefore, I have brought me something.

33
00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.880
That's what I like to drink
also always favorite.

34
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.160
* Clearing throat * So.

35
00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.480
We just have to be careful
because of Corona.

36
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.360
So, Ms. Kipping, what happened?

37
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.280
Today?
Nah, because you uh...

38
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.440
Now let's get serious,
now step back,

39
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.640
now you are out of the window.

40
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.920
The game goes like this,
that you first come to Chez Krömer

41
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.600
and then resigns.

42
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.800
After all, I didn't resign.

43
00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.280
How? You're gone...

44
00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.760
I'm just not competing again,
but other greats will.

45
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.520
But they are already gone now.

46
00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.520
You are no longer
no longer a guest for me.

47
00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.560
I can go there.
That is no longer important.

48
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.040
But you need
a listener when monologuing.

49
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.600
Yeah, sure, but that
is now for'n ass.

50
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.440
You are already
a forgotten person,

51
00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.160
Mrs., uh, Mrs. Klippmann.

52
00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.320
All right, Mr. Krömer.

53
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.600
What's next,
where does the journey go?

54
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.040
With luck it will go to Erfurt
and they still let us in,

55
00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.800
even if we come from Berlin
and are therefore risk spots.

56
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.040
No one is interested,
They are not chairmen.

57
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.800
Do you understand the game?
I understand that.

58
00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.200
For me, this is a show
only with a view to check.

59
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.920
But maybe we use
the time anyway. - What for?

60
00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.800
We can play "Three Wins",
I have a pen and paper.

61
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.920
We have to get 30 minutes around.

62
00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.160
Or play: Glass wall between us.
It's a bit like being in prison, isn't it?

63
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.800
* exhales audibly *

64
00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.600
You have been party leader for 8 years
and you are not running again.

65
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.240
Why, why?!

66
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.880
Because others also
want to become chairmen

67
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.240
and because these
8 were moving years.

68
00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.800
Our inner-party democracy
says: Every office is a temporary one.

69
00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:04.440
Blah, blah, blub.

70
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.240
Can't you get a bang out of it,
that you were bullied there

71
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.040
or beaten? That I have
have any headline for tomorrow.

72
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.480
I cannot serve with bad news about
I cannot serve with bad news about my party.

73
00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.880
But there were times
with left-wing parties,

74
00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.080
If you were at the top, you were only
carried out feet first.

75
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.280
Those days are over.
That's the rule with you leftists,

76
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.800
after 8 years the fish
starts to stink and comes away.

77
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.560
Until then, you can make sure
that there are good other people.

78
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.960
Otherwise, there's always something going on
there's always something going on, a big party, a good mood.

79
00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.640
Always vanity sunshine.
We look at the 1st MAZ.

80
00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.280
I am curious.

81
00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.080
I welcome you warmly.

82
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.080
Bernd, this is
the press conference of the group.

83
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.120
I also extend a warm welcome to you.

84
00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.840
I won a bet
that you'll bring just that.

85
00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.280
What else are we going to bring,
the Teletubbies, or what?

86
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.560
They have to expect that.
Of course.

87
00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.800
What is the answer?
Do you have something in mind?

88
00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.160
This is a cut
from the year 2017.

89
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.440
We can start
talk about the year 2017

90
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.960
or we'll be talking
sometime about 2020.

91
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.840
No, I want to talk about 2017.
Well then.

92
00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.840
What was going on?

93
00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.920
There was a conflict.

94
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.440
I think we have
now solved in the matter.

95
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.560
You say: "In the future, I want to
increasingly in society

96
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.120
Building bridges
for new left-wing majorities.

97
00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.600
In what position this will be,
will have to be discussed later.

98
00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.640
That's all for the future?

99
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.560
It is an exciting situation
- open.

100
00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.600
Maybe I only do
only specialist policy,

101
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.000
maybe I take over
other important tasks.

102
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560
Only today is not the day
where I report about it.

103
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.920
First we elect
a new leadership at the party congress.

104
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.640
But something has to happen.

105
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.840
You are 42 years old, you don't
you don't go off to die in the woods.

106
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.520
I had no intention of doing so.

107
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.640
Do you not want to say it
or don't you know what's coming?

108
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.680
There are several options.

109
00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.120
But as long as one is chairman
and no one newly elected,

110
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.560
it's funny
to talk about his plans

111
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.760
But I can rule out one thing:

112
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.760
I am not switching
to the business lobby.

113
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.560
They don't want me either.
To Gazprom, right?

114
00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:26.880
I think I would be
a bad lobbyist for them.

115
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.000
So it's good that they don't take me
and good that I don't start there.

116
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.640
Gosh, how sad everything is.
It started out so great for you.

117
00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.560
We look at the next MAZ.

118
00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.680
I would like us to
for a reduction in working hours.

119
00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.080
In the long term
a 20-hour week in the long term.

120
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.160
Do you have
this Playmobil helmet still?

121
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:54.080
Sometimes the hairstyle gets better,
when you get older.

122
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.760
Wrinkles become deeper, you know,
but the hairstyle better.

123
00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.520
Yes, I am a toupee wearer.

124
00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:03.640
I am still enthusiastic about the
I am still enthusiastic about it.

125
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.760
20-hour week?
We fired up again in the summer

126
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.040
the debate about the four-day week.

127
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:13.440
It was a topic on which
both the IG Metall steelworkers

128
00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.680
can relate positively,
like the creative worker at the laptop.

129
00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.680
I think it's also because of that,

130
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.720
that Corona for many
was a time with a lot of stress,

131
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.600
but also a time to pause:
What is really important to us.

132
00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.720
For your career
you're not above doing anything.

133
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:31.760
We have a proof photo here.

134
00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.440
They danced at the Federal Press Ball
with Hans-Peter Friedrich,

135
00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:38.080
then Minister of the Interior.

136
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:40.880
That was certainly
not conducive to a career,

137
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.240
but that was indeed ... uh...

138
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.880
you can also let your hair down
to let your guard down while dancing.

139
00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.000
How many minutes do we have left?

140
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.440
Nah, we just need to
just get going more.

141
00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.600
Okay, go ahead, grumble.

142
00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.360
Eureka,
I have an idea!

143
00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:00.640
Chancellor candidate.

144
00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.840
They are now
one out in camera 3,

145
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.240
that you
as a candidate for chancellor.

146
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:11.760
That we can present the fat Otto
can present.

147
00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.560
The show runs
and tomorrow we can say

148
00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:16.720
at Chez Krömer, Ms. Kipping was running.

149
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.440
Shall I now
tell you all about it?

150
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.080
Chancellor candidate,
what do you think of that?

151
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:24.720
I always make
a plan B, C and D.

152
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:29.120
In the event that the Left Party ever
is permanently at 14% in the polls,

153
00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.960
I do indeed intend
to the party,

154
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.240
to put up candidates for chancellor.

155
00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.640
I already have an idea
who will do it.

156
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.080
I did not want
bring myself into the game,

157
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.080
but talk to Bodo Ramelow.

158
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.920
The Ramelow? - Hm.
The Ramelow? - Hm.

159
00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.320
Do you know another one?
After all, we all know him.

160
00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.240
Is he still in office?
Of course.

161
00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:52.440
Reachable by phone again?

162
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.760
Ramelow becomes chancellor then?

163
00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.120
He does not yet know
nothing of his luck.

164
00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.760
That is the revelation
in the program.

165
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.720
* exhales audibly *

166
00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.520
Did you leave the
party chairmanship open for so long,

167
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:10.240
because you feared
that Sahra Wagenknecht would run after all?

168
00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:14.080
No, that was not the reason,
but we always said,

169
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:17.880
we want to announce only 2 months before
before the national party conference.

170
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.360
We wanted discussions
about personnel

171
00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.440
as short and concise as possible.

172
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:25.840
Some debates can be
crisply and briefly.

173
00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.680
I was going to do it in March
and few days,

174
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.160
before I wanted to proofread
to proofread my statement, Corona came.

175
00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.800
So I have to keep my mouth shut
keep my mouth shut with a poker face.

176
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.720
You are glad that
Wagenknecht has less influence?!

177
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:47.440
She is still in the parliamentary group
and has influence in the party.

178
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.560
The debate we had,

179
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.520
it was a tough controversy
that we had,

180
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.120
I think it was also
in many an editorial office.

181
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:01.160
I'm just looking.
Sahra Wagenknecht, is something happening there?

182
00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.160
Well, I can only ...
I can read faces a little,

183
00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:09.880
really suffer
you can't stand them, can you?

184
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:12.000
For me, it wasn't a personal one,

185
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.520
but a hard conflict
in the matter.

186
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.120
I understand,
You need to fool around about it,

187
00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:20.520
but I can't,
because that was a tough conflict.

188
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.960
Then seriously,
then we do not fool around.

189
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:24.680
It was a tough conflict.

190
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:28.920
The fact that it was presented as a personal conflict
between women was presented,

191
00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:32.520
is archaically understandable.
I think many an editor

192
00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:35.560
has in his head pictures
of mud-catching women.

193
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:39.000
The story of quarreling women
is also more interesting,

194
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.920
than going into the content.

195
00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.240
In the end we decided
it content

196
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.160
and agreed on this.

197
00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:47.560
It was about refugee policy.
Exactly.

198
00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:50.200
You were
annoyed at the party conference, weren't you?

199
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.880
We have a VTR.
That's where the action was, yes.

200
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.640
After this party congress
there must be an end to it,

201
00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.000
that the democratic decision-making
on refugee policy

202
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:04.960
of this party is constantly
is publicly questioned.

203
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.240
So, Sahra Wagenknecht
at the same party conference,

204
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:11.600
We have the quote:

205
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.240
"The left is in favor of,
to defend the right of asylum.

206
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:19.400
We want to help war refugees
help, but see, I at least,

207
00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:22.000
the question of labor migration
critically.

208
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.960
This discussion
we continue to have, of course."

209
00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:29.720
So far, exactly the opposite
of what you said, right?

210
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.520
Exactly, that describes
the controversy,

211
00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.320
that not only the two of us had,
but which the party went through,

212
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.160
the company and
some editors, as I have heard.

213
00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.320
We decided it in the end.

214
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:47.880
We said clearly a while ago,
that is, all factions, party leadership

215
00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.280
in the government,
in the opposition:

216
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:53.240
Solidarity means,
leaving no one behind.

217
00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.040
The last 8 years
so a bitch fight.

218
00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.680
Can you put it that way?

219
00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.280
How you sum it up,

220
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:05.120
describes well,
how this was portrayed by many.

221
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:07.840
But it was
a controversy in the matter.

222
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.600
How often did you send
Sahra Wagenknecht in the 8 years

223
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.440
a WhatsApp message:

224
00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.560
"We meet in Brandenburg
in the cornfield for an hour?"

225
00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:22.800
No, we met
rather for tea and discussed.

226
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.960
For a cup of tea. - Hm.
Was there something in the tea?

227
00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.160
No, we should have,
that might have eased the situation.

228
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.880
Never said to Wagenknecht:

229
00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.200
"Stop fishing around
fishing around on the right edge,

230
00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.680
you plop cow", or something?

231
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.840
Nah, I...
You blockhead, you elephant?

232
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.800
Were there never
real arguments?

233
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:48.640
Well, we sometimes
very clearly the opinion,

234
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:52.200
but I do not underline
that with swear words.

235
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:55.320
When I have frustration,
before Corona at least,

236
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.400
I then went to kickboxing.

237
00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:00.000
With Sahra?

238
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.360
Nah, with other
training partners,

239
00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.080
who also like to do that.

240
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.120
With a face
of Mrs. Wagenknecht. - No!

241
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.800
You box against such claws.

242
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.840
You don't punch or kick
but not against the face.

243
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.120
You don't do that.
But you imagine it, right?

244
00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.160
Nah, but you let
a lot of energy out. That's great.

245
00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.360
So conflicts help,
to become more physically fit.

246
00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:24.880
Can you defend yourself
defend yourself when attacked?

247
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.920
No, I was not
long enough at the training,

248
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:32.000
because just when I started to train
free to train, Corona came.

249
00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.400
This is too tight
and you sweat too much.

250
00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.480
You can't really ...
Oh, I could push you now?

251
00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.840
Are you calling their bluff?

252
00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.080
I have a water cup to
to fight back. - The good fili cup.

253
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.720
* (clears throat)

254
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.960
You will not meet Wagenknecht
you will not meet with Wagenknecht again

255
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:54.560
on NicNac, peanuts,
Pringles, Red Bull vodka or something,

256
00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.840
that you shake hands?
Sure, you invite?

257
00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:00.400
No, not me.
Oh, I thought...

258
00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:05.120
No, of course, I'll see you
in the Bundestag as well.

259
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:10.040
But not so much like? - Well, we
are not the closest of friends,

260
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.440
but you don't always have to be in the party
not always be, right?

261
00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:15.960
Even 30 years
after the reunification

262
00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.600
many citizens
the left is not a familiar idea to many citizens.

263
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:22.000
That could perhaps
be due to such people here.

264
00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:27.800
Energy transition is also necessary
after a revolution.

265
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:31.680
Even if we have shot there 1%
of the rich have been shot,

266
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.120
we still want to heat.

267
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.680
But what does this mean for the expansion
of renewable energies,

268
00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.920
of wind energy,
photovoltaic energy?

269
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.600
Sandra, come to the end.

270
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.440
We do not shoot them, we use them
them for useful work.

271
00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.240
That was such real crap.

272
00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.960
That was your co-leader Bernd Riexinger.
What did he say at the end?

273
00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.400
I did not understand it acoustically
not understood.

274
00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.880
All I know is that he was
was very annoyed afterwards,

275
00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.480
that he reacted so flippantly
reaction to it.

276
00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.520
But what did he say at the end?

277
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:10.560
I am not repeating this,
because I think it's wrong.

278
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.680
Direction, we have again,
what Mr. Riexinger said?

279
00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:18.200
We do not shoot you, we use you
you already for useful work.

280
00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.240
Yes, that was total crap.
He quickly apologized for it.

281
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:26.840
Linguistically slipped with the mouse?

282
00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.920
Well, there is
a difference with him.

283
00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:34.040
He made himself rather
for conscientious objection

284
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.840
and fights with me
against any form of compulsion to work.

285
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.240
That was a stupid statement,

286
00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.960
but which does not
stands for his attitude.

287
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.720
You have to say that.

288
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:46.400
So he was drunk

289
00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.200
or lightly toed?

290
00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:54.480
I believe that in this situation
made the wrong decision.

291
00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:59.000
That's so, microphone, a lot of people,
you also want to knock one out.

292
00:16:01.640 --> 00:16:05.640
He may have wanted to be funny,
but politicians and jokes ...

293
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.040
But as I said,
he was very apologetic about it.

294
00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:13.000
Another joker
of your party is Diether Dehm,

295
00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.680
Author of the book ...
You don't spare me anything today, do you?

296
00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.680
Please?
You are not sparing me anything.

297
00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.480
What did you think awaits you here?
All good.

298
00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.440
That we talk about flowers
on the balcony

299
00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:27.120
or sowing in the spring, or what?

300
00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.960
Diether Dehm with the book
"My most beautiful scandals

301
00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.000
and member of the Bundestag.

302
00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.320
He wrote a Corona song.
Let's listen to it.

303
00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.920
# Corona, Corona, Corona

304
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.520
# You are the reason for everything now

305
00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.600
# Corona, Corona, Corona

306
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.120
# Pair few you make healthy

307
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.560
# What rhymes with COVID
- definitely rhymes with profit

308
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:58.360
# I'm not gonna be threatened with #
- ♪ oh no, no, no, no, no ♪

309
00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.000
Can you tell the difference
between Corona deniers

310
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.000
and the deputy Diether Dehm
explain? I do not understand it.

311
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.400
I am not
his press officer.

312
00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:11.440
Invite him, ask him.

313
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:14.040
I just think,
this song is off.

314
00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:19.400
I have learned to always look,
is there something people can do?

315
00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:23.440
As chairwoman, you have to be partly
be a treasure hunter. He can sing.

316
00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.760
Opinions and tastes
and tastes differ.

317
00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.840
lyrics - he has produced
better songs, I just want to say.

318
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.400
"Touched 1000 times" is
at least still a hit at discos.

319
00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:38.000
He has written a novel,
a partisan novel.

320
00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.160
There's Bella Ciao, it's really good.

321
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.000
I told him
he should write more novels,

322
00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.800
but other things less.

323
00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.240
But you did not suggest
a singing career to him. - No.

324
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.480
That he goes on tour with the most beautiful songs
on tour? - No.

325
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.880
Is soon Christmas
and something for the heart.

326
00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.840
Singing is a beautiful thing.

327
00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.960
Another controversial person is
Member of the Bundestag Heike Hänsel.

328
00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.360
It is relatively open to the dictatorship
in Venezuela relatively open-minded.

329
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:15.880
"I congratulate President Maduro
on his electoral victory, #Venezuela."

330
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.360
Did you also congratulate the dictator?
Nope.

331
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:27.440
We always said clearly that,
what is happening in Venezuela right now,

332
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:29.840
is anything but socialism.

333
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.840
Why do you have
such funny names among the leftists?

334
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.280
Katja Kipping, Heike Hänsel,
Diether Dehm, Gregor Gysi.

335
00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.760
Allitera... - Still missing
Carla Columna, Bibi Blocksberg

336
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:44.040
and Benjamin Blümchen, perhaps.
Or Kurt Krömer.

337
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:49.040
Is there a conspiracy story?
KK, HH, DD, GG.

338
00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:51.800
Yes, there is
an algorithm behind it,

339
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.680
that is with random principle.

340
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.720
Katja Kipping, Chancellor.
This is a conspiracy - KKK.

341
00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.840
Now you have discovered it.

342
00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.880
Is this a conspiracy?
This is investigative journalism.

343
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.520
KKK.

344
00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.280
On election posters, it's good
to have short, concise names,

345
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.120
that are easily memorized.

346
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:17.760
Basically, the
the left with dictatorships,

347
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:21.160
with whom she sympathizes,
quite friendly around

348
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.760
- Russia, China,
Venezuela, Cuba, etc.

349
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.960
Olaf Scholz asks you:
Who is the biggest nutcase,

350
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.360
Trump or Putin?
What is your answer?

351
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.080
Both pose a great danger
for world peace.

352
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.720
Let's move on to the SPD.

353
00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:37.000
SPD candidate for chancellor Olaf Scholz

354
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.600
is enthusiastic about cooperation
with the left.

355
00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:45.640
Is the Left,
As of today, is it fit to govern?

356
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:49.040
There are still many questions,
They also asked some.

357
00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.400
There is certainly
much to discuss.

358
00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.440
I wish good performance.

359
00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.600
What does "good performance" mean?

360
00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:00.000
I.e., kiss my ass,
nice rest of your life, right?

361
00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:03.680
All the best,
also professionally, tschüssikowski.

362
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.640
His two party chairmen
are somewhat different in this respect.

363
00:20:07.960 --> 00:20:10.480
But Olaf Scholz
is not known for that,

364
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.920
that he ever expresses himself totally euphoric
and enthusiastic about something.

365
00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.880
Or do you have a VTR,
where he says: "Yeah, great!

366
00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.120
That's great,
I think they're great."

367
00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:24.000
That's not Olaf Scholz's style.
He's not a fidget spinner.

368
00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:28.320
He is very much at rest within himself. - Untypical
for a Hanseatic, rather sober.

369
00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:31.240
HB male inside.
So in this respect ...

370
00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.840
Have you ever
ever talked to Olaf, called him?

371
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:36.640
Or does it push you away?

372
00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.320
We already had
a meeting with him in the.

373
00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:43.240
But of course I have
more to do with the party leadership,

374
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.480
so from party leader
to party chairman.

375
00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.080
In your party, participation in
participation in government is controversial.

376
00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.520
The hardliners demand,
Abolish NATO

377
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.240
and the immediate end
of all combat operations.

378
00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:00.240
Do you think that the SPD and the Greens
can deal with a quarreling party

379
00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:01.880
sit down at a table?

380
00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.080
I mean, they both have,
that is, the SPD for many years

381
00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:12.120
and the Greens in some states
held out with the CDU.

382
00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.560
What they
the arguments they had,

383
00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:19.200
there you can deal with the liveliness
and the partly shrill tones,

384
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:22.640
that we have, I think,
live quite well in return.

385
00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:26.480
Otherwise, the question that
the Greens also have to face,

386
00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.520
if it's true,
what the climate protection movement says,

387
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.120
we have less than 10 years,
to stop climate protection.

388
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.040
Black-Green are 4 more
lost years for climate protection.

389
00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:40.080
How do the Greens explain
to the climate protection movement,

390
00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.800
that, it is enough for center-left,
they do black-green

391
00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:48.000
and thus lose time for climate protection
lose? Have fun explaining.

392
00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.240
But you had the chance
of a red-red-green coalition, didn't you?

393
00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.240
That's when you allowed Mutti to come.

394
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.000
That was two times, wasn't it?

395
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:59.280
2005 and 2013, when you were
party chairwoman for 1 year.

396
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.080
We had twice
the majorities for it.

397
00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.120
At that time, all three parties said
respectively: The others are to blame.

398
00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:08.840
Today I say,
that's what everyone tells me:

399
00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.840
We were all to blame there.

400
00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.720
In the last elections
there was no majority,

401
00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.760
now we are under obligation.
Stupid, isn't it?

402
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:20.040
I hear that all the time.
No matter which politicians I have,

403
00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.480
everyone always:
"It was everybody else's fault."

404
00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:25.560
I say it was
all 3 parties together to blame.

405
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:27.720
That they are all stupid, or what?

406
00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:29.400
Oh well ...

407
00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.880
Did you have the feeling
that was a successful show?

408
00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:35.840
Was that a must-attend event for you?

409
00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
I am interested in,
how the guests go home?

410
00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:40.840
Are you disturbed now?

411
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.280
Or many are also always angry.

412
00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:47.000
Are you? No, I'm not.
Are you used to worse? - Yes.

413
00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.040
Politicians are always good guests,

414
00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.040
because verbally you always
you always get one in the face.

415
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.480
This one's a joke, isn't it?

416
00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.240
The whole cabaret and comedy,
would have a problem,

417
00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:00.200
we politicians would not exist.

418
00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.880
After all, I am a journalist.

419
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.760
They would have a problem, too.

420
00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.360
Am I for you
a comedy dick, or what?

421
00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.120
I am a journalist,
Star journalist.

422
00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:12.560
But they would also have a problem,
if we weren't there.

423
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.840
I have never had any problems
never had any problems.

424
00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.960
Not even at the clown school?
What clown school?

425
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.800
Are you trying to screw me
screw me over again? - No.

426
00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.320
You have a tendency to be bold,
Ms. Kipping.

427
00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.200
Saucy Kipping.
Another alliteration.

428
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.160
Good.
You're not stupid, are you?

429
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.720
I don't think mine will last
not last 8 years as chairwoman.

430
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.800
You don't say either,
I rarely find myself stupid.

431
00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.920
A stupid question. - Yes.

432
00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.000
Well, do you want to...
What are we doing out there?

433
00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:50.200
... wish the children
still wish them a good night?

434
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.760
Politicians always do that,

435
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.120
so something uplifting
perhaps in conclusion.

436
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.440
Like this: "Tomorrow
the sun will rise again,

437
00:23:58.600 --> 00:24:02.080
forget about today.
Sometimes things just go to shit."

438
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.080
Somehow something uplifting.

439
00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:11.160
I wish everyone
still a nice evening.

440
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:16.280
And I wish above all the new
Chairman a lot of tailwind,

441
00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.360
so that we can make the
conditions to dance.

442
00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:24.440
The Sahra Wagenknecht
is to be bewitched,

443
00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.640
that whenever it runs,
then it stumbles.

444
00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:31.720
No, bad karma
is not good for one's soul.

445
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.080
But you already have
a real rage? - No.

446
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:36.920
The carrion!

447
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.880
It really hurts me for you with.

448
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:44.880
I am empathic.

449
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.520
Yes, I always find,
I'm rather dialectical.

450
00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.600
Any contradiction, even
even if it is totally annoying at the moment,

451
00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.520
can be a corrective,
that one becomes wiser.

452
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.960
Oh, I fell asleep for a moment.

453
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.040
But the rbb makes
educational television, does it?

454
00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:03.800
Yes, we are at the front,
so at the very back.

455
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.400
But when you're at the very back,
the very back is the very front.

456
00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:11.480
Then it can only go
is to go up. - Yes, we at rbb.

457
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.960
Do you watch rbb?

458
00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.880
I watch individual shows,
but... - Which ones?

459
00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:24.840
Anything,
when I need to prepare.

460
00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.840
When nothing else is on elsewhere,
do you watch rbb?

461
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:31.000
I don't watch much television,
more like streaming.

462
00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.000
What do you watch on Netflix?
We don't do product placement.

463
00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:38.960
No matter. What series are you streaming
on Netflix or Amazon right now?

464
00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.120
No matter where, we cut out
out the product placement.

465
00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.200
Why? This tip is
now presented by Coca-Cola,

466
00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:54.240
Katja Kipping, Coke is now spelled
spelled with a K, starting tomorrow.

467
00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:00.040
I really liked "Big Bang Theory"
and "The West Wing.

468
00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.120
* exhales audibly *

469
00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.480
Are we breaking up?
Come on, let's say goodbye.

470
00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.680
Distance please because of Corinna,
I almost said.

471
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.560
Please close the door
or were you born in the subway?

472
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:19.200
This must be ...

473
00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.880
... air at every opportunity.

474
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:24.680
Until the end
we don't get out of step.

475
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:28.480
So, that was practice health.

476
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.160
Today it was about
about serious diseases:

477
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.240
the left.

478
00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:38.120
Anything else you want to say?
Yes, if we're talking about health,

479
00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.360
I can say that
in healthcare the idea,

480
00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:45.080
to gear everything to profit,
is particularly stupid.

481
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.080
I hear badly through the glass.
I did not understand that.

482
00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.080
The main thing is that the sound man has it.

483
00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:55.040
Just do so
and we'll let you synchronize.

484
00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.880
Charming to the end.
Wagenknecht the carrion, the carrion.

485
00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.240
So, I hope you
in your new professional field

486
00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.640
used for useful work.

487
00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.200
Bang!
I make myself useful as always.

488
00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.480
* Audience laughs

489
00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.240
* Applause *

490
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.720
* Charles Aznavour:
"For me formidable" *

491
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.840
But this is very lovingly done.

492
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.120
# You are the one for me

493
00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:38.400
# For me, for me, formidable

494
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960
# You are my love very ... #

495
00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:44.160
Is it actually closing time now?

496
00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:45.800
# Very veritable

497
00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:52.480
# Et je voudrais pouvoir
un jour enfin te le dire

498
00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:56.360
# Te l'ecrire

499
00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.400
# Dans la langue ... #

500
00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:00.120
* Music gets quieter and quieter *

501
00:28:00.280 --> 00:28:02.800
Oh, the shit is over.
Finally!

502
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.800
What was going on, Ms. Kipping?

503
00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:09.600
Did you have a good time?
Everything fine. - Yes?

504
00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.240
Are we having another party
or is it over? - Closing time.

505
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.800
We have the shit
rocked now.

506
00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.520
Oh, that's a ...

507
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:20.840
I write the concept myself

508
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.680
and believe
I had a bad day.

509
00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:27.680
Because I only have people here
that I do not understand.

510
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.320
Do you know it?

511
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.360
I get completely insane
in this format.

512
00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:36.400
Oh, no.
Because I don't understand you all.

513
00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.480
Why do you get up in the morning?
What is your ...

514
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.800
Because the alarm clock rings
and the child has to go to school.

515
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:45.400
What is the wake up call with you,
where you say

516
00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.000
"Today I'm going on talk shows again
and say nothing again."

517
00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:54.960
You had no mean question
and no nasty quote from me.

518
00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.400
Well, because the party is stupid.

519
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:02.000
You are quasi
the head of the Kita Auenland.

520
00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.800
Then you have
there Frau Hänsel, Frau Gretel.

521
00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.320
We already have
a few others.

522
00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:12.040
Please? Isn't that
a hell of a task,

523
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:14.680
to keep this flea circus together?

524
00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.640
I would go every day
go to your party

525
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:22.000
and say:
So, we've run out of carrots.

526
00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:26.360
Then what would happen?
Please?

527
00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.440
Is that how you run your editorial department?
Yes, of course.

528
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.040
We still have beatings.
Why not?

529
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:35.240
It has to be delivered.
Is there a works council?

530
00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:36.920
Nah, of course not.

531
00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.680
On Sundays, we have a cookie.

532
