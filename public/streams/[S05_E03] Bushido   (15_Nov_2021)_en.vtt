00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.080
.

2
00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.960
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.360
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:12.200
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.160
(Berlin dialect) Well let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.920
Anis Ferchichi,
known as Bushido,

7
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.040
43 years old,
German rapper and producer.

8
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.520
Uh, hello?

9
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.480
Mr. Bushido?
Yes, please?

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.560
May I call you Mr. Bushido?

11
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.160
Mr. Bushido would be very convenient for me.
Mr. Bushido, all right.

12
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.200
Mr. Krömer will be right with you.
Yes, let me know.

13
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.680
* Krömer coughs. *

14
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.720
Hi, Diggi.
Moin.

15
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.560
Like this. Do you have everything?
To drink and so?

16
00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.760
Yes here, super glass,
beautiful crystal.

17
00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.400
Everything is great.
Is the disc gone?

18
00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.480
I was wondering, yes.
Disc is gone ...

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.360
Are you vaccinated? Are you vaccinated?
(Berlin dialect) Yes, I am.

20
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.080
Okay, shall we get started? - Please.
This will be a theme night.

21
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.520
The rbb said, fuck it,
how long it takes today.

22
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.400
Everything is broadcast.
Very well. - For hours.

23
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.640
What does your thing say? Helmut?
Yes.

24
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.880
Who is Helmut?
Kurt's cousin.

25
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.520
* Krömer sighs. *

26
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.240
We are still working with cuts.
* Laughter *

27
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.440
Uh...

28
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.680
You are sitting
as a witness in court

29
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.360
against your former manager,
Mr. Arafat Abou-Chaker.

30
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.160
How much do you regret
the contact with Mr. Abou-Chaker?

31
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.000
(sighs) Well, it's always easy,
to say in retrospect:

32
00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.120
"I regret everything,
if everything had been different..."

33
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.680
I regret many things, but especially this,
what happened in the last few years,

34
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.440
not the one 20 years ago.

35
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.480
The last four years have been tough.
I would have wished it differently.

36
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.240
But I feel comfortable
in these rooms.

37
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.920
The first guest,
where it fits like ass on bucket.

38
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.000
Yeah, I'm used to it. Where I come
where I come from, it looks the same.

39
00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.480
Are you afraid that you will be
be taken away after the show

40
00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.240
and someone says:
"Okay, guilty"?

41
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.320
For you it can
end up in a cell, right? - Yes.

42
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.280
The other day I was sitting
with me in the kitchen

43
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.080
and the people
from the object protection have gone on strike.

44
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.200
The good thing is,
you still have a kitchen.

45
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.720
Yes, I still have it,
I can go in there.

46
00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.760
The security guard went on strike and then
stood a tub from my house.

47
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.960
I'm like, "Shit, it's time.

48
00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.440
Say goodbye to the kids. Oh, no,
They're at school."

49
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.440
Yes, from time to time I am afraid.

50
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.000
A crime charge is,

51
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.240
that you were attacked with a plastic bottle
were attacked.

52
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.080
Mm.

53
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.400
You're a gangster rapper, right?
Yes.

54
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.840
What went down?

55
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.920
Many have made fun of
made fun of the plastic bottle.

56
00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.720
I was lucky
that there was no glass bottle.

57
00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.600
But was it a ... I can think of
the company Saskia from Aldi comes to mind.

58
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.640
That's relatively soft.
Mhm.

59
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.720
Spreequell is already tougher.
Mhm.

60
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.800
This is mate.
Mhm, glass.

61
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.560
Can we name the product?
I do not know.

62
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.240
I believe,
it was a Turkish water company.

63
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.040
I know that,
but I do not know it.

64
00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.720
You had to give 50% of your income
to Mr. Abou-Chaker.

65
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:29.480
In court you said
that officially it was 9 million euros.

66
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.320
Why pay 50% to someone?

67
00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.360
Well, it should start
actually with 30 %.

68
00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.240
That then took on a life of its own,
in the end there were 50.

69
00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.040
I would guess even more.

70
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.360
9 million was, I think,
little estimated.

71
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.720
But once you're in there,
then you get paid.

72
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.080
Just like almost
every other German rapper,

73
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.640
that currently
exists on the scene.

74
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.320
Always 50 %?

75
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.280
I was once offered
offered me a contract with 35%.

76
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.800
That you have to turn in?
I was going to call the police. - Yes.

77
00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:04.800
I have then also made.

78
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:08.080
What kind of
for persuasion work?

79
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.720
That one says then nevertheless:
fifty-fifty is a fair thing.

80
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.240
Sometimes you do things or
something is put on the table,

81
00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.280
you can't say no,
you can't refuse these offers.

82
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.560
Knives and guns, or what?

83
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.880
(sighs) Who knows.

84
00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.040
I like the suit very much.
Yes.

85
00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.720
I am the golden boy from rbb,
that's why. - Yes, isn't it? And ...

86
00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.080
I'm approaching 50, I get to
wear gold suits. - Awesome.

87
00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.680
I don't begrudge you ...
Uh, I indulge you.

88
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.720
Thank you, Mr. Bushido.
With pleasure.

89
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.920
For 14 years you and Arafat were
heart and soul, as you can see.

90
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.600
Oh, that was Marbella.

91
00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.160
On the right is Abou-Chaker, not
Maya the Bee for the color-blind.

92
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.360
You were a little thinner, huh?
How old were you, twelve?

93
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.080
Did he pick you up
from school that day? * (LAUGHING)

94
00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.160
Explain this picture.
This was Marbella.

95
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.280
I don't know,
why I ended up there.

96
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.040
I was asked, "What does it look like?
We're flying to Marbella."

97
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.360
What they did there,
I do not know.

98
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.680
In the evening we went out for dinner.

99
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.720
I was also allowed to decide for myself
what I eat there.

100
00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.560
Wait a minute, what do you mean,
I was a little ...

101
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.040
Yes, I was a bit thinner.
True.

102
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.240
Spacko.
Yes, real spacko.

103
00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.400
Were you a spacko?
Can you say that?

104
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.160
Yes. - Okay.
Often.

105
00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.960
In 2017, you broke up. Why
didn't you stay friends?

106
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.240
You can also end something
and still remain friends. - Yes.

107
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.200
In any case,
that was also my intention.

108
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.040
Money and real estate
I'm not so attached,

109
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.160
that could also have been split up.

110
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.080
But I think
there was a sense of honor

111
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.880
and losing face more important,
than to preserve the friendship.

112
00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.720
We almost moved in together,
I have a house next to his.

113
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.000
It's all passe.
Is that still yours? - Yes.

114
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:04.400
Or did you give it to him
and said, "Shut the fuck up"?

115
00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.320
I wanted to offer it to him,
walked up to him and said:

116
00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.640
"Fifteen million worth, give me half."
He did not get back to me.

117
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.840
Now it's going into foreclosure.
Why?

118
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.320
How am I supposed to get my money?
Well, that's right.

119
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.240
And who wants next to him ...
Cut, stupid question.

120
00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.960
You will see that later
on television.

121
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.800
Only the good questions. - Okay.
That one sucked. - No problem.

122
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.800
Helmut, uh, Mr. Bushido.

123
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.400
You met Abou-Chaker,
when you were still with Aggro Berlin.

124
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.520
Yes. - So, when you didn't want to be with
you didn't want to be with Aggro Berlin anymore.

125
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.000
Correct.
Past tense.

126
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:43.000
Why?

127
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.120
This guy is mafia.

128
00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.200
Now you can't say anything again?
No, what does may ...

129
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.600
You can leave that
for the time being, yes. - Okay.

130
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.560
I wanted to get several months
out of my contract.

131
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:04.000
But Spaiche, Specter and Halil
somehow did not want that.

132
00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.440
That was my question, why you didn't
you didn't go to the lawyer.

133
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.600
I did go to the lawyer.
What was in this contract?

134
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.320
That you had to pay
You had to pay coal until your death?

135
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.680
Were the rights all in this
contract in it, for life?

136
00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:22.880
Not for a lifetime, but e.g.
5% from my merchandising.

137
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.040
That was not because of
bad conditions or anything.

138
00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.960
But if the lawyer
had studied law,

139
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.880
you would have gotten out of there.
She's a flitzpiepe.

140
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.520
No, then we would have

141
00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.760
have to argue for years,
like Xavier and Moses.

142
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.200
Someone came up to me and said:
"I know someone.

143
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.360
If you're up for it,
I'll introduce you to him."

144
00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.360
That was Mr. Maya the Bee for the poor.

145
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.000
Are we allowed to say that?
Why not? I am allowed to.

146
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.640
Can we cut
cut it with just you? - Sure.

147
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.880
Then I'm off the hook.
Then you don't have to be afraid.

148
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:23.240
What happened after the separation
from Mr. Abou-Chaker?

149
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.920
I wanted to clarify everything sensibly
and with him personally.

150
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:30.600
Even if I was maybe once a
Spacko was and partly still am,

151
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.680
but immediately lawyers, police ... was
I was also forbidden by them.

152
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:38.440
But then that didn't go any further,
which did not bother me.

153
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.680
But then they wanted
my wife and my children.

154
00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:45.040
Uh, stop. We are not allowed
not say for legal reasons,

155
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.680
what happened afterwards.

156
00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.120
The two of us or you as the broadcaster?
The rbb. - After all, I'm not rbb.

157
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.160
I am BUS.

158
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.480
What is BUS? - The first
three letters of Mr. Bushido.

159
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.680
* Krömer laughs. *

160
00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:03.960
Is really true,
I read over it.

161
00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:07.560
There is a legal announcement.
That's where you make a cut.

162
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:10.040
But if that is
is legally feasible ...

163
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.600
I'll take that on my head, yes.

164
00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:16.080
I've even gone so far as to say
say we leave everything in.

165
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.000
What do you think of that?
You're a go-getter.

166
00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.440
* Krömer sighs. *

167
00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.880
What did I say from the beginning?

168
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.240
It's all a big game.
This is a big game.

169
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.920
Look here,
he is my brother!

170
00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:36.640
These people told you ...
Put the camera away. - No, leave the camera.

171
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.640
People have said zero chance,
a big war in this country.

172
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.800
This prosecution ...

173
00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:46.200
I know him,
I know his group.

174
00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.840
I know his group.

175
00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.920
What he has done,
no one in the world does.

176
00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:53.920
He blames it on me,
on the clan.

177
00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.400
That's strange.

178
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.760
I was,
as if I had heard something.

179
00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:04.480
(laughs) Yes? I think
that was the creaking.

180
00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.520
Maybe they mixed
Ecstasy in my mate.

181
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.320
If nothing was,
you can't talk about it.

182
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.120
Give a sip.

183
00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.840
Are you drinking from the bottle?
* No, not like that.

184
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.640
Back, clan is called.

185
00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:22.480
If you want to be a rapper,
you need a back.

186
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.040
What's all this poop for? Why?

187
00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.480
Why do you need this back,
which then takes 50% off you?

188
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.520
I know a rapper who had to
50% with the management,

189
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.800
with his old one and with the new one.

190
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:40.400
And again at the tax office.
Which then amounts to 150%.

191
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.200
(laughs) Yes, that's where you make minus.

192
00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.320
That's not so easy to say,
just gangster rap ...

193
00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.240
They are always all
equal personally pissed

194
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.960
and if you rap something,
they come over...

195
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.840
I am glad that I no longer have
have nothing more to do with it.

196
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.600
I no longer have a back,
only disc.

197
00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.200
But you have played the game
for years. - Yes.

198
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:04.760
It also looked like
that it was fun.

199
00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.680
I have also set myself,
that I will be smoked today.

200
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.640
I don't smoke anymore.
Horny.

201
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.000
I have here this ...
Horny. What is this?

202
00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.840
For legal reasons
I am not allowed to say what it is.

203
00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.400
But now you're in court,
you even cried.

204
00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.880
Is that crass, when the past catches up with you?
the past catches up with you? - Yes.

205
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.160
Especially if you run away from it
run away from it

206
00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.840
and you also
with gangster rap attitude.

207
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.920
It's not as if I was
was a highly gifted philosopher

208
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.240
and then
and then have a creative crisis,

209
00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:41.680
but it was rock 'n' roll
and in truth everything sucked.

210
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:44.120
Then the past
the past catches up with you.

211
00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:47.680
And the much bigger problem
is with five children

212
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.200
or six, seven and eight children
and wife and so.

213
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.240
None of them deserve that.

214
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.000
Your wife once fled
from you. - Hopped, yes.

215
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.240
Well, hopped, fled.

216
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.760
I understood "fled".
Fled.

217
00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.480
Escaped, yes, without G.

218
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.640
Do you want me to ask again? Your wife
fled out the window.

219
00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.520
Hopped. - Colleagues
accuse you of oppression.

220
00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:15.520
We have a few headlines.

221
00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.520
Do you feel the need to apologize?
to apologize? - No.

222
00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.240
With the flat-earthers who have
no way.

223
00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:30.720
With my wife, definitely yes.

224
00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.600
With the woman already?
Yes, safe.

225
00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:35.480
Have you done it yet?
Yes.

226
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.560
We are still together today.

227
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.800
I apologized.
You did? - Yes.

228
00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.600
Prioritize, you know?

229
00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.400
So, first Abou-Chaker.

230
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.400
For legal reasons, we do not know
not what was then.

231
00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.080
Now go to picture TV

232
00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:55.080
and give long interviews
about your private life.

233
00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:59.600
That's how criminal gangs attract you.
A little bit, yes.

234
00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.960
I hope for a great career.

235
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.360
What's going on? Why do you go
you go to bed with the picture now?

236
00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.840
* Bushido sighs. *
Is it about money?

237
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.480
Do you make the last round with
the collection, collect coal?

238
00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:18.120
No.
and then run away?

239
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:20.960
Are you leaving?
No, I'm staying here.

240
00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:25.240
I sometimes have big fights at home
at home, they're fed up.

241
00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.560
It is not fun
and the sun is missing,

242
00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.240
but I could imagine
staying here

243
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.080
or does not want to run away
in that sense.

244
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.400
For the interview with Bild
I didn't get any money, like here.

245
00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.200
Did you get your ass grabbed
grabbed your ass?

246
00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:45.200
I don't want to talk about it.
It's not there anymore. (laughs)

247
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:47.880
But why go to Bild, why?
Why not?

248
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.200
Does it always go on like this?
Otherwise I was not invited.

249
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.600
How many LKA officers do we have here?
I'm not allowed to say.

250
00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.560
For legal reasons I am not allowed
I am not allowed to do that. - Okay, there are some.

251
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.480
The game goes on
until the day you die.

252
00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:07.800
Or does Abou-Chaker call at some point:
"Diggi, bygones be bygones"? - No.

253
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.160
No way, I wouldn't
answer the phone.

254
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.840
Does he still have your number? - No.
Will you push it away then?

255
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.280
No, I think
he doesn't have the number.

256
00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.760
Unknown participants
I have blocked.

257
00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:23.320
Then the next banger:
Homestory.

258
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:25.800
No...
Frauke Ludowig.

259
00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.560
What was it called, "Exclusiv"
or "Explosiv"? - Yes.

260
00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.520
Well, what should I do?
This is getting shittier and shittier.

261
00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:36.240
The woman was in your ...

262
00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.120
I hope you have
you're just renting this house. - Yes.

263
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.880
Did you? - It's like this.
Very good.

264
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.000
These were not the real
Children's room, the bedroom ...

265
00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.960
Oh, I already live there,
but it's only rented.

266
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.320
For Frauke?
No.

267
00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:55.800
You have to think of it this way ...
The new house is smaller, isn't it?

268
00:14:55.960 --> 00:14:58.360
Does that have
to do with real estate prices?

269
00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.760
No, actually it is not
smaller, even 120 square meters larger.

270
00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.400
850 I have now,
before it was 680 or so.

271
00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.880
But why do a
a home story?

272
00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.560
I used to rap
rapping about anal sex.

273
00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:15.000
Yes, we'll get to that in a minute.
We can do that.

274
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:18.520
Now I sit with wife and kids
in the kitchen and so ...

275
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.600
Are you bored and call Frauke
on the phone? - Yes. - That's silly.

276
00:15:22.760 --> 00:15:25.080
I canceled "Jungle Camp."

277
00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.200
Did they ask you to do that?
Mhm.

278
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.960
I should go to "Let's Dance."
Can you see me on "Let's Dance"?

279
00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.720
We can both go,
as a gay couple.

280
00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.120
Immediately.
They really ask me.

281
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.360
Yes, me too. - Also for
the first season of Dschungelcamp.

282
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.800
There would be 50,000 DM,
back then it was still DM. - Yes.

283
00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.560
I said I would transfer
transfer DM 60,000 to them immediately,

284
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.920
if I am allowed to stay at home.
Yes.

285
00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.000
Yes, but "Let's Dance"
I would do.

286
00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.040
But that's ...

287
00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.960
A home story ... for Frauke,
I almost said.

288
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.200
That is the last thing
thing you can do.

289
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:05.000
No, there are
even worse things.

290
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.520
Believe me, I'm speaking from experience.
They're still coming, from Bild.

291
00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:12.880
I do not wish to comment
I do not want to comment on that at the moment.

292
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.880
So, where do we go from here?

293
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.680
Police protection
until the end of your life. How ...

294
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.880
Bushido in 15 years,
what does the day look like?

295
00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.880
Oh, actually quite good.

296
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.880
My days are looking pretty good.

297
00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:33.960
In 15 years, I mean.
Also, sure.

298
00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.640
Let's take
a Monday in 15 years.

299
00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.320
Best day in the world,
Children go the school.

300
00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:42.760
Monday is for me anyway
the best day of the week.

301
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.480
I find,
my life is actually quite good.

302
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.920
I would not
portray it so negatively.

303
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:52.000
The police are also a good thing, as
I first had to learn painfully.

304
00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.640
That's all right.

305
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:57.400
What was it like when the policemen
came to protect you now,

306
00:16:57.560 --> 00:17:00.680
that you used to
you used to beat up or call names?

307
00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.360
What did the first meeting look like?

308
00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.200
At the first meeting
I first ran away.

309
00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:09.520
In front of the police? - I fled
fled one floor up.

310
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.440
They came to my wife,
I should go to the side.

311
00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.000
I know
many people at the LKA well,

312
00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:20.120
a few were already at my
at home, with resolutions etc.

313
00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.360
Fortunately
not yet with a red slip.

314
00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:26.640
That was totally strange for me,
I ran away for a while.

315
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:31.480
When I'm out and about with them,
it's still funny.

316
00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.400
Not because they are inhumans,

317
00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.040
but because I
a lot of shit.

318
00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:40.000
I was unfair to them.
They're at your side 24 hours a day?

319
00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:43.480
When you sit with your naked ass
sitting on the couch and think:

320
00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:45.920
"I'm going down to the pub" ...

321
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.600
Can you do it alone?
You don't really know.

322
00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.400
What do not know? - I have to
to the legal gray area.

323
00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:59.160
We are not allowed
not say for legal reasons.

324
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.440
With Frauke Ludowig in the home story

325
00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.840
you were wearing one of those T-shirts
with a rainbow flag on it.

326
00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:09.360
Do you know
what that sign is? - No.

327
00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:11.520
They sent that to me for free.

328
00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.840
In the gay, lesbian
LGBTQ queer community ... - No.

329
00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.480
... this is such a sign.

330
00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.040
Oh no, what am I going to do now?
What was going on there?

331
00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:23.880
I don't know,
I must have had a blackout.

332
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:27.240
Weren't gays always the ones
that you dissed?

333
00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:30.480
Together with the women?
"Berlin will be hard ... " - Shh.

334
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:34.240
"... because we beat up
every faggot." 2003.

335
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.440
Yes. - "It's quite normal, men
don't suck dicks." 2013.

336
00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.320
Where did that turn of phrase come from?

337
00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.400
Let me put it this way, the twist ...

338
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.120
Look, music and lyrics,
leave that aside.

339
00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:48.960
I embody a character there.

340
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.400
I never had anything against ...
I see, you were an artificial figure.

341
00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.720
I wouldn't say
I wouldn't say that,

342
00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.160
but I never had
anything against gays.

343
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.480
I don't feel like
to tell this all the time, you know?

344
00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.840
Well, when you sing
sing against gays ...

345
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.640
It's not that it's anti-gay.

346
00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:08.320
This is against the guys and gals,
who I mean with my texts,

347
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.200
not against the gay scene.

348
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:13.520
I have no desire
to explain it to them all the time.

349
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.160
Which gays do you mean?
I didn't mean gays at all.

350
00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:22.320
What did you mean when you said:
"We'll beat up any faggot"?

351
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.600
The guys who get on my nerves
from my milieu.

352
00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:29.160
Not boys holding hands
and making out with each other.

353
00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.240
You mean that as an insult,
like: "You handicapped person"?

354
00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:35.600
Unfortunately, yes, but that is
no longer in my texts.

355
00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.800
Would you sing that
sing it again today,

356
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.680
if I had
had a nice fag text?

357
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.880
No, I would also no longer
"Fuck the LKA" rap.

358
00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.680
There are things
that you don't necessarily have to do.

359
00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.160
You don't want to smoke anymore either.
I would like to.

360
00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.640
Do you smoke?
No, I have quit.

361
00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:55.080
Drugs? How is that,
when you want to smoke pot?

362
00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:58.440
Can you say to the LKA:
"Watch out, it's a need"?

363
00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.800
I have also evaded taxes,
without asking the police first.

364
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.960
They got me anyway.

365
00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:07.280
Doing what?
By evading taxes.

366
00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.920
I have a criminal record after all.

367
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.680
Do you still have money or do we have to
or do we have to worry? - Go like this.

368
00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.120
You didn't do that with Frauke Ludowig
for the money?

369
00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.200
I have also there
I didn't get any money. - What? No!

370
00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.640
I swear,
I did this for nothing.

371
00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.960
Neither does the Amazon thing,

372
00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.800
which is also produced by Bild
is also produced by Bild? Why?

373
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.200
That's up to Peter Rossberg.

374
00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:35.560
This has become a good friend,
he works there.

375
00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:37.320
I'm coming to you, too, to the rbb.

376
00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:39.000
With the gropers?

377
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.480
Yes, well ... I think..,
he wasn't that into men.

378
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.640
Doesn't that come at a bad time? When
is the season coming out? - 26.11.

379
00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.280
Shouldn't that come out on November 1
at the same time as "LOL"?

380
00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.120
Yes, already last year, but they
took into account the process.

381
00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:57.920
What can we expect this season?
You have to watch.

382
00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:02.320
(laughs) I can't,
if it's postponed for months.

383
00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.560
But comes now and even
all in one, six episodes.

384
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.400
And a second season
is already planned?

385
00:21:09.560 --> 00:21:11.760
Yes, I am producing
myself right now.

386
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.120
Will this be such a
"Goodbye Germany" story"?

387
00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.440
No, no.
You're really staying in Germany?

388
00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.440
Should I spoil now
or how is that?

389
00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.840
You're going to fuck off.
You think so? - Of course.

390
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
I was two months the other day ...
Where Abou-Chaker can not enter?

391
00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.560
(laughs) I don't know.
He doesn't have a criminal record.

392
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.920
Canada?
Canada or can he not there?

393
00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.040
We cut that out,
that comes awkwardly.

394
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:44.240
That's when everyone would say:
"The interview was awesome until now,

395
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.120
then came this pun.
Fuck you!"

396
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.760
So, your former partner,
Mr. Abou-Chaker,

397
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:54.080
is charged with, among other things
charged with deprivation of liberty.

398
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.880
Your children
can no longer go to school alone.

399
00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:59.480
Have you robbed your family
robbed your family of their freedom?

400
00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.120
Your children must

401
00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:04.880
brought to and from school by the
be brought to the school and back again.

402
00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:09.000
I am responsible for quite
a lot of cheese,

403
00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:14.760
that must now be endured by my wife and
my children must endure.

404
00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:18.360
Yes, definitely.
That was one of the biggest reasons,

405
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.720
why I started
rethink.

406
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:23.680
Bushido would not have to
actually not have to rethink at all.

407
00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.000
Kurt Krömer
could also continue smoking,

408
00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.560
but at some point this no longer makes
no longer makes sense.

409
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.040
You must not harm your body
in harm's way,

410
00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:35.680
I didn't want to affect my family any more.
to suffer any more.

411
00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:39.120
This goes to the physical
health. - The mental.

412
00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.840
To mental health,
honestly.

413
00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.080
Two months ago, my wife
wanted to have me committed.

414
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:48.800
What have you had? - Depression,
anxiety, panic attacks.

415
00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.760
At its finest, I lost weight,
looked like this spacko photo.

416
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.720
You were fatter a few months ago.
Yes.

417
00:22:55.880 --> 00:23:00.080
It's not nice when you don't know
how life will go on.

418
00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.000
But I'll get out of it.

419
00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:08.320
When I was preparing the show
the show all the time:

420
00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:12.600
I invite you,
am I making fun of you?

421
00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.600
I compare it
with a right-wing radical,

422
00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.600
who was blatantly right-wing,
then says, "I won't do it anymore."

423
00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:23.160
Would I reach out my hand to him
and say, "Okay, Digga, good,

424
00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.240
Shit happens, it's over"?

425
00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.600
Hmm, everyone has to ...
How is it with you?

426
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.120
Rainbow flag,
Homestory with Frauke,

427
00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:35.200
now the Amazon doc.

428
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:37.200
Your performance here.

429
00:23:37.560 --> 00:23:39.200
Can we take that off your hands?

430
00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.840
Are you the one who says: "I have nothing more to do with this
I have nothing more to do with that shit.

431
00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:46.440
Shake my hand and that's it"?

432
00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:49.000
Everyone must
decide for himself.

433
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.240
The rainbow flag
I wore out of conviction,

434
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:54.680
I speak politely out of conviction.

435
00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:58.360
Some days I say: Don't bust my balls
don't bust my balls, idiot.

436
00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.800
Whether someone can do something with it,
everyone must decide for themselves.

437
00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:06.600
I get along well at home,
with my wife, as well as ever.

438
00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.320
My children grow up
with their mother and father.

439
00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.640
That is the most important thing for me.

440
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.960
Whether someone says: "That's all
with the gay T-shirt" ...

441
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.640
I don't care.
Let him do it, it's all good.

442
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.480
How long do you have to do this,

443
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:25.400
until everyone really says, "Okay,
Bushido is not the same anymore"?

444
00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.640
I do not do it,
so that they say that.

445
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.320
At some point, I'll be out of the window,
I have firmly resolved.

446
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:35.240
I can live without publicity.
Because you are emigrating to America.

447
00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.240
No, because of my parole.

448
00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:40.360
What parole?
I just told you.

449
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.160
I was on probation.
For taxes? - Yes.

450
00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:45.200
Tell me ... as a gangster rapper!

451
00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.440
Then I said "buck teeth" to a woman with
crooked teeth "hare's tooth".

452
00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.120
For this I got
I got a year's probation.

453
00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.840
Did she have buck teeth?
Yes or no? - Yes.

454
00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.440
Don't,
that they lock you up again.

455
00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:00.720
You say it again.
Parole has expired.

456
00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.480
Well, but maybe
it will be renegotiated. - I ...

457
00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.040
When one of your kids says:
"Dad, I have a great idea:

458
00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.800
I'm going to be a rapper."
What would you say?

459
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.800
This is what happened yesterday.

460
00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:15.480
I was traveling with my
youngest son Issa on the road

461
00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:19.880
and my wife said, "Do you know
what your son wants to be when he grows up?"

462
00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.680
I said, "No. Issa,
what are you going to do when you grow up?"

463
00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:25.400
"I want to rap."

464
00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.120
I'm like, "Shit, dude.
"Please don't.

465
00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:31.360
I'll give you anything you want,
but no rap, please."

466
00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.400
We have to wait and see.
My money is on schooling.

467
00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.520
You lost in Berlin.

468
00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:41.720
Or are your children already
in school in America? - No.

469
00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.800
No, but I always go
to school, am on the ball.

470
00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.400
You go to school yourself
or do you pick up the kids? - Both.

471
00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.960
Or do you make up school?
No. - Do you go to parents' evening?

472
00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:55.360
I had to the other day,
four parents' evenings in two weeks.

473
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.080
You know,
how all those guys look?

474
00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.520
They would
want to run out again.

475
00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.640
Are there also LKA officers in the parents' circle?
LKA officers in the parents' circle? - (annoyed) Yes ...

476
00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.640
I'm sitting there with all the parents,
it's really not funny.

477
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:14.480
Or in a circle like that. "Who are you?"
"Yes, hello, I'm ..." Whoa.

478
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.440
"What color is your feeling?"

479
00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:20.720
Then such a ball is thrown
and you have to answer.

480
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:22.640
Oh my god,
I think to myself...

481
00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.280
Is this a school or ...
Waldorf school.

482
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.080
If they weren't my kids,
I wouldn't be doing this, dude.

483
00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.600
Come on, let's take a selfie.

484
00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.000
Ah, I got mail.

485
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:47.720
Is this the last time we'll see you
in a talk show in Germany?

486
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.640
I don't think so. I don't want to
spoil it, but I don't think so.

487
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.440
Would be cool,
last appearance with Kurt Krömer.

488
00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.600
Should I cancel on others?
Yes.

489
00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.800
But only if we both dance together
on "Let's Dance." - No.

490
00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:04.040
Would you do that?
Yeah, sure.

491
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.360
Would you
take part in "Let's Dance"?

492
00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.920
You and me,
as a homosexual couple? - Yes.

493
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:14.520
Think it over carefully.
When you shake hands...

494
00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:16.640
Yeah, I'm not letting go of those.

495
00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.440
Then we'll hold hands today.
No, but think about it.

496
00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.600
So, now it's over.

497
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:28.360
What kind of conversation was that?
Was I derogatory to you?

498
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:31.880
Did I ask something that you
you've already answered 100 times?

499
00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.760
No, I thought it was great.
I was really pleased.

500
00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:40.040
I do many things,
but not every thing.

501
00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.000
Tonight
I was looking forward to very much.

502
00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.480
Are you a fan of mine,
or what?

503
00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.400
Yes.
I didn't know that.

504
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.520
You could have said.
Have you ever been to a gig?

505
00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.840
No, but if you had brought
Merchandise with you ... - Please?

506
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.600
Merchandise.
I have not. - No?

507
00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:02.760
Okay, Diggi.
Then I would say ...

508
00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.720
Thank you.

509
00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:07.160
Then we go out.

510
00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.520
Can we do it at the same time?
Don't know

511
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.880
If I go out,
I get shot?

512
00:28:12.040 --> 00:28:13.520
Well, try it.

513
00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.280
Comm.

514
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.280
So, take a seat there, please.

515
00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:25.760
Standing or sitting?
Now comes the conclusion, so to speak.

516
00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:27.720
We have no audience there today.

517
00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:30.920
We can pretend,
but even that ...

518
00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.520
Now that you're retiring,
we still have something beautiful.

519
00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:39.320
We have folded for you
and this garden gnome ... - Horny.

520
00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.680
The integration garden gnome.
Super.

521
00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.240
For a solid life.
I'll put it at home.

522
00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.880
Mr. Bushido,
thank you for the interview.

523
00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.560
With pleasure, Mr. Krömer.

524
00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.200
What color is your feeling?

525
00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.160
A little green.

526
