00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:04.080
* Music *

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.560
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

4
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.320
Kevin Kühnert: 30 years old,
Chairman of the Jusos,

5
00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.800
does not want
become chairman of the SPD.

6
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:27.560
SPD ...

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.880
For the older ones:
You remember.

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.600
* Audience laughs. *

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760
Mr. Kühnert,
are you there yet?

10
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.880
I'm already here, hello.

11
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.800
I already have the first question:
Did you come with the BMW?

12
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.920
Not today, for once.
There was no one standing around. Good.

13
00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.600
So, we need to hurry up a bit.

14
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.680
SPD ...
It can be over by the minute.

15
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.560
* Laughter *

16
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.680
* Hum *

17
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.680
So ... Beautiful.
Good evening, Mr. Kühnert.

18
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.760
* loud exhale *

19
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.840
* Laughter *

20
00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.040
You have allowed yourself
a fat Otto.

21
00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.000
Which one exactly?

22
00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.440
Don't pretend you don't know
what it's all about.

23
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.960
We are completely lost.
We are completely screwed.

24
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.680
Because I'm in the SPD?
No, we know that.

25
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.360
That's sad enough.
* Laughter *

26
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.000
The one about the party chairmanship.
Yes.

27
00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.880
We invited you four weeks ago

28
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.640
and thought, here sits the
future SPD party chairman.

29
00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.400
But you have shirked.

30
00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.080
Do you think if I had done it,
I would have said yes to the show?

31
00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.400
After all, they couldn't know it yet.

32
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.440
Yes, but maybe
I had a tendency in my head.

33
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.320
Did you know beforehand that ...
Do you want something to drink?

34
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.560
If you have a water, gladly.
But it also works like this.

35
00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.000
Can you take from the refrigerator
take. But that's nice.

36
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.480
Would you like something?
Yes, a still water, please.

37
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.400
A still water.
She knew...

38
00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.800
When you said yes,
you already knew

39
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.880
that you will not run as the future
party chairman?

40
00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.920
No, but I tended
in one direction.

41
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.200
I took the theme
with me on summer vacation

42
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.840
and had a feeling
where it could go.

43
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.840
Should I drink from the bottle
or what? Yes ...

44
00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.440
Do you want this cup?
No, you take it.

45
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.520
Uh... Have a seat.

46
00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.480
Let's take a look,
how you pressed...

47
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.880
So, as you ...
As you have expressed,

48
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.560
that you are not included.
Good.

49
00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.480
When one
make a decision like that,

50
00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.880
you have to consider
consider two things:

51
00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.720
It is a political decision
and a personal one.

52
00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.840
Politics is made by people,

53
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.480
who also have to decide for themselves
must decide,

54
00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.440
whether they can and want to
they can and want to bear.

55
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.360
In summary:
You have no balls. * Laughter *

56
00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.200
That's one way to comment on it.

57
00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.200
You could also say that I can
assess my possibilities well.

58
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.720
Meaning?

59
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.120
The fact that I was so excited about the idea of
of doing this for two years,

60
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.920
came to the conclusion:
I rather don't trust myself to do it.

61
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.400
That's an honest announcement, isn't it?

62
00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.400
Yes, that does
not always in politics.

63
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.120
Are you an honest guy?

64
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:59.040
Like all of us, I try to be
to be as honest as possible.

65
00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.680
I do not always succeed.
Nice pen. Please?

66
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.560
Nothing. My favorite pen.
Do you like it?

67
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.920
Yes, but your favorite pen...
I'm not giving it away. Right.

68
00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.600
Did you think in advance:
This can only go in the pants?

69
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.560
Or were you afraid of being
to be bullied like Andrea Nahles?

70
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.920
Pressure in politics does not start
starts with the SPD party chairmanship.

71
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.920
I have pressure now, too.
Right now, in the second?

72
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:31.840
This is my
most relaxed appointment today. Yes?

73
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.880
Have you already
tougher deadlines behind you?

74
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.120
Yes ... We've only just started.
Yes ... * (LAUGHING)

75
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.440
Maybe there was irony in it.
Please? Nothing. Good.

76
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.320
Were you finished?
Not really, but...

77
00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.440
Go ahead.
We want you to finish.

78
00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.840
Gu... That is generous.

79
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.600
Yes, well ...
I'll put a tick in the box.

80
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.920
It would have become even more pressure.

81
00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.840
The question is,
whether you have enough support

82
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.200
or whether there are many
who work against you.

83
00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.040
The honest assessment is:
There would have been.

84
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.280
Gesine Schwan
could imagine,

85
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.600
that you will take over
the party chairmanship.

86
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.800
Now Stegner is doing it with her.
What does he have that you don't?

87
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.720
Good question.
She denies it in the meantime,

88
00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.080
that she seriously considered
running for office with me.

89
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.120
It was just a statement like that.
How? Was it meant to be flippant, or what?

90
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.760
"Here with the Kevin I do that",
even though she didn't mean it?

91
00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.680
Supposedly she wanted to
express appreciation:

92
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.600
"There are good people in the SPD,
z. For example, this one."

93
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.640
Did she also mention your name
or did she say, "Him!"?

94
00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:47.840
She also said my name,
but did not mean it as an offer.

95
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.480
Therefore, we never talked about it.

96
00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.840
Did you even think about it,

97
00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.320
with whom you could go
could go to the head of the party?

98
00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.000
Or was it clear from the start
that you would say no?

99
00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:05.360
Sure, you think about it for a moment,
but I had a different approach.

100
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.080
I think,
we have good people in the SPD,

101
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.440
whom I trust to take this step.

102
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.760
I have made an effort to,
to encourage these people:

103
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.640
"You take the step,
I'll support you."

104
00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:21.280
I believe,
it has to be teamwork.

105
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.880
From the talks
unfortunately did not lead to a result in the end.

106
00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.160
We have prepared a VTR.

107
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.640
Since 1946
the average age has been

108
00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.440
of the SPD party chairwoman
54.6 years when she took office.

109
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.120
The new candidates are
56.3 years old on average.

110
00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:45.880
5 years below the average age of
age of SPD members.

111
00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.640
But rejuvenation goes differently, doesn't it?
Rejuvenation goes differently.

112
00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.720
Were you good at math?
That's not even 2%, is it?

113
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.000
2% what?
Difference.

114
00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:02.040
Yeah, something like that, anyway.
* (LAUGHING)

115
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.240
Can you do the math on that?

116
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.480
2% of what?
Well, the difference.

117
00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:11.880
The difference?
* Laughter *

118
00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.480
So 56.3 ... minus 54.6.

119
00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:20.120
What does that add up to?

120
00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.240
Yes, I think just under 2%.

121
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.000
But...
Do you?

122
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:28.480
Hm? Result? No, but you
have surely calculated it.

123
00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.400
No, I have not.
Well, pff ...

124
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:35.920
Can't you do math?
Of course, but not that.

125
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.880
Are you in a stressful situation?
Me? Not at all.

126
00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.200
I have a stress ball for you.
Take it.

127
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.000
You could have
taken off the note. No!

128
00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.600
We'll change that tomorrow.
I see. * (LAUGHING)

129
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.280
There you can ...

130
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.840
Go ahead and take it. Yes ...
You can relieve stress. Fine.

131
00:07:56.400 --> 00:08:00.040
But as the most famous 30-year-old

132
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.480
you could have
could have torn down the quota.

133
00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:07.480
It's not just about age.
Yes, it is, about rejuvenation.

134
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.840
I don't just base that on the
the party chairmanship.

135
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.520
There are still people behind it ...
But they are all old.

136
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.080
Everyone who has run for a
party chair is old.

137
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:20.760
Our Secretary General, for example, is 41.

138
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.320
In politics
that is crawling group.

139
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.320
And what will you be when you're 30?
* (LAUGHING)

140
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.840
Crib.
Preschool, or what? Exactly.

141
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.480
Can you already
sing and clap? I can.

142
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:37.840
Go ahead and use the stress ball.
Not that you'll say later...

143
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.080
Go ahead and bang on the table.
Very nice.

144
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.240
Put your hands together once in a while.
(annoyed) Yes. Offer something.

145
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.320
Reading. Olaf Scholz said:
"It's not doing the SPD any good,

146
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.800
when it comes across,
like nobody dares."

147
00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.440
Did he mean you?

148
00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:56.800
* (LAUGHING)
No, he meant himself.

149
00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.240
But he dared to do it.
Yes, that's why he said the sentence.

150
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.960
To get back at you?
I don't think that's...

151
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.960
Are we actually on a first-name basis?

152
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:10.840
I may offer you the you.

153
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:15.000
You had agreed on Amthor,
you only use the first name in one direction.

154
00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.440
You've already seen the show?
Of course I have. Today? Yes.

155
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.920
Oh, wait. Cut.
* (LAUGHING)

156
00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.160
Last week?
* (LAUGHING)

157
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.600
* Applause *

158
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.080
Uh... Are you
in a stressful situation? Please?

159
00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.960
Are you in a stressful situation?
No. * Laughter *

160
00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:42.960
You have seen last week's episode
with Philipp Amthor last week? Exactly.

161
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.560
Weekend.

162
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.240
* (LAUGHING)
Cut.

163
00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.320
They did not want
not to run for office.

164
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.280
They say it should
not to be an entertainment show,

165
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.680
when you are
are in the battle with Scholz or something.

166
00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.680
Yes ...
Why are you thinking about entertainment?

167
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.440
I think some people find that
entertaining. Of course.

168
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.440
But you limit that
only to entertainment.

169
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.360
I would not have made an entertainment
out of it.

170
00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.240
But it previously hints.

171
00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:23.440
When Der Spiegel writes: "If
Kühnert is now also in the running,

172
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.080
it will be a spectacle," shows the,
what they want to make of it.

173
00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.520
The great chair festivals.

174
00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.080
It will be less about
who wants which tax concept,

175
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:37.880
but rather: "Will the
the GroKo supporter prevails?

176
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.600
What will happen to Olaf Scholz's career,
if Kühnert wins?"

177
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.240
This is
not a purposeful discussion.

178
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.600
But you would go to the jungle camp if
if Scholz came along?

179
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:52.080
If Scholz goes to the jungle camp?

180
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.480
Now don't say anything wrong.
* (LAUGHING)

181
00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.000
The SPD needs every vote. Yes.

182
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.720
Afterwards he goes out as jungle king
and you have the salad.

183
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.640
Yes, that's stupid ...

184
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:07.120
Is there anything else coming?
* (LAUGHING)

185
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.880
Never say never
in politics.

186
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:13.840
Why not Scholz and Kühnert
as dual leadership?

187
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.880
Because our gender quota
does not allow that.

188
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:19.480
Who started it?
The Greens?

189
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:23.040
We have had the quota
for 30 years.

190
00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:26.520
Man and man at the top
is not possible? No.

191
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.400
Woman and woman would go?
No, also not.

192
00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.880
It is not a women's,
but a gender quota.

193
00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:37.040
No gender may be represented in the management
be represented by less than 40 %.

194
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.280
Unless you have a person.
Then there is no other way.

195
00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:42.400
* Laughter *

196
00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.080
But that would be a sign.

197
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:50.680
If two women were to do this, the
the gender Female would be right in front.

198
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.040
Yes, but we are concerned
about equality.

199
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.800
The right answer to
thousands of years of preference
men

200
00:11:57.080 --> 00:12:00.160
is not thousands of years
of preference for women,

201
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.240
but real equality.

202
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.360
That's good,
but is it successful?

203
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.640
Only a quota
does not bring equality.

204
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.840
It also has
to do with leadership culture.

205
00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.800
Andrea Nahles said it beautifully ...

206
00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:15.600
How is she actually doing?
I don't know.

207
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:20.160
Aren't you going to call them? We don't have
We don't have that close a relationship.

208
00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.720
That's what you do with close friends ...

209
00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.520
Does anyone talk at all
with Ms. Nahles?

210
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.880
Do they ever say thank you
or "You did a good job"?

211
00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:34.360
I imagine her standing
alone in the corner of the Bundestag.

212
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.320
Everyone walks by and thinks: Mm ...
* Laughter *

213
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.640
Even if it's ...
Why don't you give them a call?

214
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.560
I wrote to her then ...
A text message?

215
00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.920
Yes, of course.
It's heartfelt.

216
00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:51.640
On a day like this, hundreds of
I can't call on a day like this.

217
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:56.120
You could have called a day later
could have called. That was also no rest.

218
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.160
A week later.
Yes ...

219
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.320
The opportunity
will surely arise.

220
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:07.600
So ... And you want to
to end the grand coalition, don't you?

221
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:11.680
I thought the grand coalition
wrong from the very beginning.

222
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.840
This has not changed
nothing has changed in the past year.

223
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.760
We have 2018
set a rule of the game,

224
00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.640
when the majority
decided in favor and said:

225
00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.360
After 2 years, we take stock
and reassess the situation.

226
00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:30.640
These two years will be up at the end of 2019.
Then we will make the decision.

227
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:34.800
That's why I don't have to explain my position
explain my position to everyone again.

228
00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.200
Without the party chairmanship
you have nothing to say.

229
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.240
That's why I'm sitting here?

230
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:44.720
You should sit here as the future
party chairman sitting here,

231
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.160
now you're just sitting here as Kevin.

232
00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:51.160
Because you haven't found anyone else.
* Laughter and applause *

233
00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.000
We have prepared 60 questions,

234
00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:57.520
with "Dear Mr.
future party chairman".

235
00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.920
And now?
It's a shit show. Yes.

236
00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.920
We could have also invited the chairman
of the esoteric party.

237
00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:09.200
Yes, the violets.
The violets, for example, also good.

238
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.320
Do you know their party leader?
I would like to meet him.

239
00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.120
Today we get to know you
first. All right.

240
00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:20.320
* (LAUGHING)
What?

241
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.760
Up there...
Is a spider.

242
00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.880
(laughs) There's a spider.

243
00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.000
* Laughter *

244
00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:34.800
There is a blonde spider
with glasses up in the corner,

245
00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:39.840
holding a cardboard so that Mr.
Kühnert knows what to say.

246
00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:45.840
So, we come to this
great eminent domain story. Oha.

247
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.240
We open the next chapter.

248
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.480
You suggested
in an interview with Die Zeit,

249
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.200
corporations like BMW
in the hands of the workers.

250
00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:57.400
Thereupon a trade unionist said
from BMW about the SPD,

251
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.240
that is no longer eligible.

252
00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.160
You can't get more in your face than that, can you?
But in that case for him.

253
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.840
He is a trade unionist
on the works council of IG Metall.

254
00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.960
The statutes
of his union states,

255
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.160
that it wants to socialize large
wants to socialize,

256
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.640
because they should be in the hands
of the workers should be.

257
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:24.040
Who did not comply with the statutes
he or I? Well.

258
00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:29.800
You propose collectivization.
Will I soon own BMW? No.

259
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.920
You don't work there.

260
00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:35.960
BMW in the hands
of the employees ...

261
00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:39.200
Oh, not in all?
I thought the people owned BMW.

262
00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:41.760
Why do we need collectivization?

263
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:46.480
Because corporate decisions, as
they are made in capitalism,

264
00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.040
do not orient themselves to the interests
of a majority.

265
00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:55.040
BMW is half owned
by Mrs. Klatten and Mr. Quandt.

266
00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.040
These two siblings
own 50% of it.

267
00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:03.640
Last year they received
1 billion in dividends.

268
00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.600
1.1 billion

269
00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:09.440
But that still has to be
be taxed.

270
00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.160
That doesn't leave much.

271
00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.600
With our
lavish property taxes ...

272
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.560
Then there is still
a manager must be paid ...

273
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:19.560
I believe this will be
paid from the rest of the money.

274
00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.400
But the 1.1 billion ...

275
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:25.720
Why do you have
a better number than me?

276
00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.800
For the order of magnitude
the decimal place also counts.

277
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.160
Ms. Klatten
got every half hour in 2018

278
00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.360
as much money as a police officer
net per year after training.

279
00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.960
This is
not performance equity.

280
00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:40.480
I have no problem
if someone,

281
00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:44.600
who bears blatant responsibility
in the management floor,

282
00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.520
goes out with more.

283
00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.520
But here
earned umpteen hundred times over.

284
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.400
I find that
not justifiable even then,

285
00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:56.120
if band employees like at BMW
get a good salary.

286
00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.240
Many said
Kevin wants the GDR back.

287
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.600
Have you not thought about it,
that people think

288
00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.040
Shit,
are we driving Trabants again tomorrow?

289
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.360
May I call you Kevin Honecker?
* (LAUGHING)

290
00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.840
He came from the Saarland,
I am a Berliner.

291
00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.600
The roofer
from Saarland, huh? Yes.

292
00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:16.560
What is Erich Honecker doing?

293
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:21.960
Party colleague Johannes Kahrs
tweeted, "What was he smoking?"

294
00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:26.720
What were you smoking,
when you made the statements,

295
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:31.920
with your Juso friends in the shared flat
with ready-made pizza and bong?

296
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.400
The same as always.
Do you smoke? Yes. Do you want to?

297
00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.760
Suitcase? I see.
* (CLEARS THROAT)

298
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.600
How do you actually live?
For rent.

299
00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.280
And what do you pay?

300
00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.080
For my part of the apartment
or the whole?

301
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:52.640
What, WG? Yes.
Ah! Oh.

302
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.600
Kreuzberg?
No, Schöneberg.

303
00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.000
Schöneberg? Mhm. What do you pay?
Do you have a room?

304
00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:02.520
Well, kitchen would be stupid to sleep in.
* Laughter *

305
00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.480
* Applause *

306
00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.480
How can I imagine this?

307
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.640
You have a 15 sqm room
with mattress on a europallet?

308
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.320
* And a table,
a candle on it...

309
00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:20.160
and a small bust of
Willy Brandt? And of Karl Marx.

310
00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.320
From Karl Marx and Erich Honecker.
By Erich Honecker with hat.

311
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.200
With fun hat. Exactly. Good.

312
00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:28.400
How big is the room?

313
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.440
The room is ...
I don't know.

314
00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:37.000
16, 17, 18 square meters?
In Schöneberg. So 1,800 cold.

315
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.000
* Laughter *

316
00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:41.080
We were lucky.

317
00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.920
We moved in seven years ago and
got a graduated lease.

318
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:49.920
Our landlord
is located in Lichterfelde and ...

319
00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:53.520
Thank you very much.
He had not really ...

320
00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:59.120
with how the prices in Schöneberg are developing.
price development is in Schöneberg.

321
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.960
We benefit from this.

322
00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:05.240
Keep talking,
I'm off the beat.

323
00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:07.200
Yes, with pleasure.

324
00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:11.760
The graduated lease expires in 2020
expires, we would have to pay much more.

325
00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.840
But due to the rent cap
of red-red-green we were lucky

326
00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.320
and still have
a nice rent.

327
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:21.560
Criticism of capitalism is all well and good,

328
00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:24.840
but the last 20 years
the SPD has been in power for 16 years.

329
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:28.000
Why was capitalism
not overcome?

330
00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.560
Because I'm not the chairman of the SPD.
And you won't be! Right.

331
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.800
What's the plan? At 35
you'll be kicked out of the Jusos.

332
00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:40.600
Someone ties you up
with cable ties,

333
00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.920
you need to get out of the office.

334
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.280
You're waiting that long?
No ... A fox.

335
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:49.840
You wait until they all start to grind away.
and then Kevin comes.

336
00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:54.880
Mm. Some would say,
now would have been the moment.

337
00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.480
But in the end, a person must
decide for himself.

338
00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:02.800
In my two years as
as Juso chairman,

339
00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:07.480
that I lack the ability to influence
on politics is lacking

340
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.360
and I can't also
can initiate debates.

341
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:13.840
Next time you have the chance
for the party chairmanship,

342
00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.840
the SPD
may no longer exist at all.

343
00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.120
Yes, the danger is always there.

344
00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.240
After all, we are not
under UNESCO World Heritage protection.

345
00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.720
It can happen.

346
00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.600
Firecracker.
* Laughter *

347
00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:34.680
Now to personal matters:
You were born in Berlin,

348
00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:37.880
but on the outskirts
grew up in Lichtenrade.

349
00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.760
A lot of the time, yes.

350
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.880
Do you think,
that makes you better?

351
00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:46.080
No.
Lichtenrade is already beautiful ...

352
00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.720
Is already ...
Rich. No.

353
00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:53.760
A mixed district
with high-rise housing estates

354
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:56.040
and single-family houses.

355
00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.840
Before that I lived
in Lankwitz and Mariendorf.

356
00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:04.080
Mariendorf: harness racing track.
Lankwitz: animal shelter.

357
00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.920
* Very good.
There you can recognize the Berliner.

358
00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:10.680
Berliners can't get
out of their district.

359
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.640
Right. Today I live 1 km
from the hospital where I was born.

360
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.480
Because something is still open?
* Laughter *

361
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.040
* Applause *
Like, what...

362
00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:26.280
Umbilical cord already cut?
Has been cut, but is still in storage.

363
00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.680
If needed, I can hook up.

364
00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.920
Your parents are civil servants,
you are a politician.

365
00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:36.440
So: Worked was
not really in your family.

366
00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:40.040
Exactly, it was modeled for me.
You live into the day.

367
00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.920
Is that your lifestyle?

368
00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.280
Do you lie in bed all day?
I wish.

369
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.680
Does the party leader come in
and you say:

370
00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:51.440
"Nah, I'm nice and comfy in bed"?

371
00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.960
Yes.
"I still have Pringles there ..."

372
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.760
* (LAUGHING)
"And malt beer."

373
00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:59.760
Many prejudices about politics
are justified.

374
00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:04.080
But I would for people
in all parties reject,

375
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.880
that you just
rocking the balls.

376
00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:14.000
Even in an honorary capacity, politics is
incredibly time-consuming.

377
00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:18.160
It's seven days a week,
there are no real breaks.

378
00:22:18.520 --> 00:22:20.480
You set them yourself.

379
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.440
No one represents you when you are on vacation.

380
00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.520
If one is not there,
you have to have great confidence,

381
00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.440
that the store also runs like this.

382
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.760
That's why many people hardly ever
vacation or just hang out on their cell phones.

383
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:36.840
We all do it
voluntarily and with pleasure,

384
00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.040
but it's already stress.

385
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.400
You used to work for real,
in the call center.

386
00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:49.120
Yes, almost four years.
Did you sell insurance?

387
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.720
I worked
for a mail-order toy company.

388
00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.600
Which one?
Paraphrase, do not name the brand.

389
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:58.800
Um...
A product of this company.

390
00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.360
Do not mention the name.
No, that's...

391
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.880
a mail order company
with many brands under one roof.

392
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:10.960
This Toys.
Yes ... There are two with toys inside.

393
00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.160
Toys for us?
No, the other one.

394
00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:18.240
What? My Toys, man.
My Toys? Yes.

395
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.680
Do they still advertise with you,
with pictures with Kevin Kühnert?

396
00:23:23.840 --> 00:23:27.000
Exactly. "Call,
he's still working here."

397
00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:30.200
That would be a bad check.
What do you have there ...

398
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:33.960
Is asked in the call center,
how the toy works?

399
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.480
"I have a ball here.
How does it work?" * Laughter

400
00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:41.760
You can not imagine
what calls there were.

401
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:45.760
There was the so-called poop dachshund.
The what? The poop dachshund.

402
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:49.040
You could ...
The poop dachshund? Yes.

403
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:54.160
When you turned a wheel,
something came out of the dachshund.

404
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.040
Poop? Poop dachshund.

405
00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.560
Someone called and said,
the poop dachshund no longer poops.

406
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:04.600
Cut.
* Laughter *

407
00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:10.520
We are taking the call center
completely out. * Laughter *

408
00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.680
You have said three times
Poop dachshund three times.

409
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.800
They asked three times.
* throat clearing *

410
00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:21.120
Is that so prudish at rbb?

411
00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.840
As a proper Young Socialist
you took a census.

412
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000
We have prepared something.
Oha.

413
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.840
Census 2011, the term used to describe the
the census.

414
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.440
After 25 years
the time has come again.

415
00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.040
You could call it
called a large inventory.

416
00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.480
For this purpose
4 % of Berliners were selected,

417
00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.840
who are contacted
and must provide information.

418
00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.760
Namely, a so-called interviewer.
We met one of them.

419
00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:53.120
Equipped with questionnaires
Kevin Kühnert will be on the road from Monday.

420
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.840
The student
is one of 1,800 interviewers,

421
00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.920
who help the Berliners
to help them fill out the forms.

422
00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.800
He has undergone training

423
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:04.240
and no fear,
that the door will be slammed on him.

424
00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.480
Yeah, you were nine?
* (LAUGHING)

425
00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.040
Or was that ...
In any case, it was a few kilos ago.

426
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.960
Baby fat, huh?
Well, it is still bit.

427
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.960
You are still young. At 30
you still have baby fat. Right.

428
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.480
You've always been media-hungry,
what?

429
00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:27.840
How many people
do the people count?

430
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.920
Well ... Thousands.
You must have jumped the queue.

431
00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:36.680
We had a training ...
How? Is just ringing.

432
00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.480
Yes, but how do you deal
with unruly people,

433
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.520
who say:
"No, I don't"?

434
00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:47.680
"Here I have for you the
Poop Dachshund!" Exactly. * (LAUGHING)

435
00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.840
This is how it looks.

436
00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.160
The rbb came to our training
and was looking for someone,

437
00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:59.440
who lets himself
can be accompanied for a few minutes.

438
00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:02.760
Who makes an ass of himself.
It wasn't that bad. Good.

439
00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.480
A university degree
you don't have? No, I don't.

440
00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:10.760
You haven't learned anything.
That makes two of us.

441
00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:13.240
Why?
* Astonishment and laughter *

442
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.040
Oh ...

443
00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:20.880
I hear voices. Where are ...
The neighbors are having a party.

444
00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.280
Yes. Berlin.

445
00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.480
I am at least semi-skilled.
True.

446
00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:30.280
I'm semi-skilled in the call center.
But you have nothing.

447
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:33.120
I am
semi-skilled men's outfitter.

448
00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.400
You ...

449
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.840
You ever had lunch at the university?
* That's right, yes.

450
00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:46.800
As civil servants, don't your parents
don't wake up screaming at night?

451
00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.480
"The boy
does not have a university degree,

452
00:26:49.760 --> 00:26:52.720
is in a party that will no longer exist
will no longer exist in 10 years?

453
00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.080
V. a. Second
I don't think she's worried about the second thing.

454
00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.560
My parents know that I
can take care of myself since I graduated from high school

455
00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.840
and have done so.

456
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.880
This reproach comes often but does
my arguments no worse.

457
00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.360
If you find them wrong,
you have to refute them in terms of content.

458
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:15.120
Democracy works
without regard to the person.

459
00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.480
Everyone has the same voice and
the same right to raise it.

460
00:27:19.640 --> 00:27:22.520
No matter,
what the personal background is.

461
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:28.840
I am not on anyone's pocket
and do not understand the accusation.

462
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.760
So, who will be
party chairman?

463
00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.720
Good question.

464
00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:38.040
I have a favorite pair.
The Borjan? Walter Borjans.

465
00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:42.400
And Saskia Esken.
And they will then dissolve the GroKo?

466
00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:45.920
They have
the same position on this as I do.

467
00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.320
And you ring Borjan's doorbell in the evening

468
00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:51.160
and say: "Remember,
what I told you"?

469
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.760
He lives in Cologne,
that's too far.

470
00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:56.520
But that would be
your job, right?

471
00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:00.680
Yes, but ... If I
should vote for the SPD, the plan is:

472
00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:05.000
You drive to Cologne every night,
ring Borjan's doorbell and say:

473
00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:08.800
"Take care of it,
that the GroKo goes away."

474
00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.200
You can take off your underpants
over your head. Yes.

475
00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.400
Already tasted?
Of course you have. * (LAUGHING)

476
00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.200
I do not wear underpants.
Aha.

477
00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:21.000
All right, we're going out, Kevin.
Good.

478
00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:23.480
Because that was it.

479
00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:28.960
You can stand at the lectern
and apologize. * (LAUGHING)

480
00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:33.000
Now comes
your plan for Germany.

481
00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:37.960
About 90 minutes.
90 minutes. All right, here we go.

482
00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:42.080
No, I want to apologize
for that little diss just now. Why?

483
00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:45.600
That was unfair about the training.
Well, I'm unskilled. Yes.

484
00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:49.040
That's why I'm at rbb.
Right. * (LAUGHING)

485
00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:51.640
I'm going to die here.
* (LAUGHING)

486
00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:56.040
Will the show be continued after the first
four episodes? Or ...

487
00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.800
I do not believe
that it will be continued. Yes.

488
00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.280
I see that as a diss now.

489
00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:05.120
And what if the SPD
is politically committed to this?

490
00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:08.440
The SPD could be in favor of,
that I continue?

491
00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.160
Sure, state broadcasting and all that.

492
00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:12.520
Vote SPD,
ladies and gentlemen.

493
00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:14.440
There! That's settled.

494
00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.480
* Applause *

495
00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.960
* Music *
