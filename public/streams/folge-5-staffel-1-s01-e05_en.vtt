00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.960
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.600
We have a duty to build a bulwark
against anarchy!

4
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.480
They shot them down.
Nobody saw that.

5
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.640
The blood is not yet dry
and you are already covering up.

6
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.280
Don't you recognize me?
 Greta!

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.640
He's gone under the wheels.
But it doesn't look like an accident.

8
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.920
He was not a tough guy.

9
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.760
What else does your landlady
about this Kardakov?

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
Have you done anything
about your previous tenant?

11
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.920
His mistress
lives at Meraner Straße 7.

12
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.520
I have an appointment with him.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.200
Connect me
with the Soviet Embassy.

14
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.240
*A child hums a song.

15
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.400
*He hums a song.

16
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.800
Hands up, police!

17
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.320
(quietly) Leni ... Leni.

18
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.600
Leni, take a look. Take a look.

19
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Bang.

20
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.640
Take it off him.

21
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.720
He's already big, he knows,
how it works, right?

22
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:43.960
Bang.

23
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.280
Hans, give your father the gun!
- Come on.

24
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.520
No.

25
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.880
Come on, give me that now.

26
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.800
Come on, give me that!
- No.

27
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.800
*Shot, scream*

28
00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.720
*He breathes uneasily.

29
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.880
*exciting music*

30
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200
Svetlana!

31
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.200
*dark music*

32
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.480
*The doorbell rings.

33
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.000
*fast music

34
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.160
Ah!

35
00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.000
*He speaks Russian.

36
00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280
Ah!

37
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.240
*Man bangs on the door
and curses.

38
00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.720
*driving music

39
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.160
*Buzz*

40
00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.560
*exciting music*

41
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.480
*Buzz*

42
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120
Sweta ...

43
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.680
*He laughs.

44
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.440
*quiet piano music

45
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.000
*quiet piano music

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.440
*Rattle

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:55.880
*uncanny music

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.360
*rhythmic music

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.800
*Train rattles.

50
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.960
*snore*

51
00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.600
Give me that! Give me that! Now let go!

52
00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.320
Leave it!
- Give it to me!

53
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.320
Leave it!
- Give it to me!

54
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.160
Yes, then get out!

55
00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.400
Greta!

56
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.200
Tomorrow.

57
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.800
Where were you yesterday?
I thought you weren't coming back.

58
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.520
I didn't know
where you had gone.

59
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.520
Did you sleep?

60
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.400
Come on.

61
00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.120
Berta, where's the widow?
She's already downstairs.

62
00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.600
Brief malfunction?
 Already happened.

63
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.000
It won't take long.
This is Greta.

64
00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.600
And?
With the best recommendations.

65
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.640
I am interested.

66
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.400
Should take a shower first.

67
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.920
The showers in her palace
are defective.

68
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.920
Do the vocal cords work?
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

69
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.960
The good Lord is merciful.

70
00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.480
I can't recognize anything
of your beauty.

71
00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.000
Can we borrow something?
You're going to anyway.

72
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:22.240
Comm.

73
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.800
Impress me, kids.

74
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.760
Let's do it!

75
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.320
*snore*

76
00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:34.400
You are left with three marks per visit.

77
00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.160
You can take
a real room.

78
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.320
You can borrow the clothes.

79
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.280
You just have to
bring it back again and again.

80
00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:45.960
Washed indeed,
but you can help yourself.

81
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.960
*sniff*

82
00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.200
Greta?

83
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.840
*sob*

84
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:03.600
I can't do that.

85
00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.200
Gosh, Greta,
you are so beautiful.

86
00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:11.120
But I can't.

87
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.160
But why not?

88
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.800
It's not that bad.
You can choose the boys.

89
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.840
If you don't like someone,
you turn him down.

90
00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:22.280
That's how it works here.

91
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:31.720
*she sighs.

92
00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:35.400
Is it infected?

93
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.480
A little bit.

94
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.720
*She sobs.

95
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.360
Is good.

96
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.760
We'll find something for you.

97
00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.200
Yes.

98
00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.480
Come on.

99
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:53.880
It'll be fine.

100
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.720
My Gretchen.

101
00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.000
*quiet music

102
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.560
"Lignose".

103
00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.400
*There's a knock.

104
00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.680
Oh!

105
00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:02.240
*It knocks again.

106
00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.400
(surprised) Stefan.
Charlotte.

107
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.800
What are you doing here?

108
00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:12.440
This is my workplace.
I'm looking for a file right now.

109
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:17.800
But this is the table
of Chief Superintendent Wolter.

110
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.800
Yes, I am his assistant.

111
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:20.840
Hm.

112
00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.120
What are you doing here?

113
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.000
I uh ...

114
00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.840
I'm supposed to hand something in.
But only in person.

115
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.920
Where is he?
Somewhere in the house.

116
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.480
Well, then ...
I'll come back again.

117
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.200
All right.

118
00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.840
Oh um ...

119
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.800
Is the invitation still there?
Sunday at eleven?

120
00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:43.960
Huh?
Bathing at the rowing club.

121
00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:46.800
I see. Yes.

122
00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.400
Of course.

123
00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.480
At the entrance,
I'll take you in with me.

124
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:52.360
Beautiful.

125
00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.960
*He groans.

126
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:10.680
I've really tried everything,
but that's all I can do.

127
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:20.520
I would ask at the copying plant.
They store the negatives there.

128
00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:21.760
Really?

129
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.280
See here at the bottom right,
at the perforation?

130
00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:27.320
This is cheap material.

131
00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.240
The movie positive,
you have found,

132
00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:33.440
on which the film was developed.
And?

133
00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:36.360
The film material
comes from Yugoslavia.

134
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.720
I asked around a bit.

135
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.720
With your permission?
Certainly.

136
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:44.520
The only copying plant
that Rodacor sometimes uses,

137
00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.160
is Geyer.
Where is that?

138
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.800
In Neukölln. Quite a big store.

139
00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.680
Does that help you?

140
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:53.920
Yes, thank you very much for your efforts.

141
00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.400
*exciting music*

142
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.600
Yucatan.

143
00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.680
Hello? Please connect me
with Cologne, 1308, thank you.

144
00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.520
*The phone rings.

145
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.640
*The phone rings.

146
00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.240
*Door opens.

147
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.160
*The phone rings.

148
00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360
(Mrs.) Rath?

149
00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.760
Helga, it's me.
Gereon.

150
00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.440
Can you speak?
Yes, of course I can.

151
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:48.000
Did something happen?

152
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:51.320
I just wanted to
just wanted to let you know.

153
00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.160
I had some kind of
strange dream.

154
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.920
From Anno.

155
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:01.360
So, from his Trakehner.
Yucatan.

156
00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:03.440
Mhm.

157
00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.160
Gereon?

158
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Yes?

159
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.600
I miss you so much.

160
00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.640
Then come here.

161
00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.560
(laughs in disbelief) What?
Come to Berlin.

162
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.800
But that doesn't work
just like that.

163
00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:23.240
Nobody here cares about us.
What do you mean?

164
00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.840
I mean ...

165
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:27.600
It would be nice
if you were here.

166
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:31.280
You mean you and me
and two glasses of beer in the zoo?

167
00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:35.560
Dancing at the "Resi" in the evening and
to the Krumme Lanke for breakfast?

168
00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.880
"Everyone once in Berlin."

169
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.560
"Everyone once in Berlin."

170
00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:44.720
Oh, that would be nice!

171
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:47.920
But that doesn't work
just like that.

172
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160
Yes.

173
00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:52.840
You're right,
it was a crazy idea.

174
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:57.520
I have to hang up now.

175
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
*voices from outside*

176
00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.160
Have you seen this yet?

177
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:10.360
*Honk*

178
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:13.320
* angry shouts*

179
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:16.200
*Honk*

180
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.720
Murderer!

181
00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:24.160
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

182
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.800
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

183
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.200
*shouts from outside

184
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:34.120
And that's what happened to us
happened to us in Oranienstraße.

185
00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.280
Official version.
Because of the two ladies.

186
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.800
"... we were
shot at from several sides."

187
00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:45.600
"Individual communists

188
00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.480
had opened fire on
Inspector Rath and me."

189
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.800
Are you serious?

190
00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.720
"Hands are only washed by hand.
If you want to take, then give!"

191
00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.400
Those up there
have come under a lot of pressure.

192
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.960
*Shouts, applause

193
00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.360
Völcker!

194
00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.720
Comrades!

195
00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.520
Workers were
shot down like dogs.

196
00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:21.640
You can also add your
your own sentence structure.

197
00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:24.200
I'm not so good
with words.

198
00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.280
(Völcker) ... Children abused!
*shouts*

199
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.200
God, them again ...

200
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.200
I myself was a witness,
how an attempt was made,

201
00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:36.480
our fighters a police murder
on our fighters.

202
00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:38.720
On two innocent women!

203
00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.000
And the police chief
warns the population,

204
00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:45.400
to keep calm.

205
00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:46.800
Fuck them!

206
00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.960
"Calm blood"
is in this situation

207
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.520
the most inappropriate of all slogans.

208
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.720
Because the blood of our comrades

209
00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:59.160
seeps away in these moments
in the pavement of our streets,

210
00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.200
shed by these murderers
in uniform.

211
00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:11.280
We must put an end to this agitation
put an end to this agitation immediately.

212
00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.000
Workers' blood flows in Berlin!

213
00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.560
Our blood is not calm.
Our blood is boiling, Mr. Zörgiebel!

214
00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.000
*cheers*

215
00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:25.840
I will have the space cleared.

216
00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:30.400
Karl, we need to react with caution,
not react with more pressure.

217
00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:34.640
Otherwise the situation will escalate.
- Let's give them time,

218
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.760
storming the Bastille
on the Bastille?

219
00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.840
We are not the Bastille.

220
00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.960
The Lord Mayor Böß.

221
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200
Gentlemen!

222
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:47.800
They are ...
out of control out there.

223
00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:51.800
Please take a seat first,
Mr. Lord Mayor.

224
00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:52.680
What are your plans?

225
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.920
The whole city is in turmoil.

226
00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.280
We have introduced a series of measures
initiated.

227
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.680
Tonight we have
control again.

228
00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.160
What measures?

229
00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.280
Ban on going out
after dark,

230
00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.680
closed windows to the street.

231
00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:11.320
No civilian
may carry a weapon.

232
00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:16.120
In the event of non-compliance, our
our emergency services may open fire.

233
00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.720
That's not very ...
- Not very what?

234
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:21.920
Our party organ
speaks of up to 200 dead.

235
00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:24.520
This is misinformation.
- Ah.

236
00:18:24.760 --> 00:18:27.760
Hospitals report
significantly fewer victims.

237
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.160
And this?
"Execution by police bullets".

238
00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.680
The women from Kreuzberg
are already martyrs.

239
00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:37.600
How do you want to portray that?
Self-defense?

240
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.800
(Zörgiebel)
Two witnesses from the custom

241
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.480
are currently writing a report.

242
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:46.920
He will put things
in the right light for us.

243
00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.200
Maybe there is a way,
to turn the mood around.

244
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.600
And what would that be?

245
00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:56.280
It's all a question of how you read it.
Nobody writes:

246
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:59.400
"The demonstrators
were armed."

247
00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.120
Nobody writes:
"The police were attacked."

248
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.360
We need proof of this.

249
00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:09.520
An injured policeman,
something obvious.

250
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.920
Yes.

251
00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.120
Exactly.

252
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:18.760
* angry shouts*

253
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.800
(Mr. Commissioner,
this way out.

254
00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.880
Violence is the midwife
of every new society.

255
00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.320
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

256
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.800
(Völcker) This is what Marx teaches us.

257
00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.480
And these times are violent,
Comrades!

258
00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.400
For each of our killed
Comrades ...

259
00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.400
Can you become a member here?
- Sign up, comrade.

260
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:56.480
... we should
a representative

261
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.440
of this oppressive system
liquidate it.

262
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.960
That is the language
that these people understand.

263
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:04.640
*cheers*

264
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.440
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

265
00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.320
Murderer! Murderer! Murderer!

266
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:15.600
All right, order
a press conference.

267
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.920
Very good. Yes.

268
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.200
(from outside) Murderer! Murderer!

269
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.400
Flown out, both of them.
When do you expect them back?

270
00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:43.800
Do I have to tell you this?

271
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320
I can also take you with me.

272
00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.000
I have no idea,
when they're coming.

273
00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.160
Sometimes like this, sometimes like that.
Just like an artist.

274
00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.560
Do you have a key to the apartment?
No, not at the moment.

275
00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:57.720
He has that?
Kardakov?

276
00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:59.120
Yes.

277
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.840
When was he here?
Last night.

278
00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.560
What?
Yes.

279
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.520
He had forgotten his key
forgotten his key.

280
00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:08.160
Now he has mine.

281
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:10.800
Maybe he is there.

282
00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.400
I thought,
You've already rung the bell.

283
00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.360
I'll go back upstairs and knock.

284
00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.000
Yes, yes. I'm waiting.

285
00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.560
Second floor?
Mhm.

286
00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:30.280
*she sighs.

287
00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:36.320
Miss Commissioner?

288
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.440
It was nothing.
Thank you, goodbye.

289
00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.800
Reunion.

290
00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.720
*Your shoes clack.

291
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.880
*Door squeaks.

292
00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.800
(Is anyone there?

293
00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.600
*exciting music*

294
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:47.920
*Floor creaks.

295
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:51.680
Hello?

296
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.760
*exciting music*

297
00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.200
*strumming

298
00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:32.600
*The doorbell rings.

299
00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.280
To the "Dutchman".
- With pleasure, Mr. Tretschkow.

300
00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.800
*exciting music*

301
00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.000
This is it.

302
00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.000
Hello, miss.
Do we have the badge with us?

303
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.680
I have here
unfortunately no Johann König.

304
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.280
Is there a company name?
König Filmproduktion.

305
00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:31.240
König Filmproduktion ...

306
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.360
I don't have one here.

307
00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:35.880
Nothing at all?
No.

308
00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:39.640
What about Krajewski?

309
00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.400
Krajewski, Franz.

310
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.480
Uh here.

311
00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.680
And you are Mr. Krajewski?

312
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:49.840
No, I'm the stand-in.

313
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.800
The collection of the material
is bound to this gentleman.

314
00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.400
Who is the technical
supervisor of the order, please?

315
00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.960
Film 701, Sternberg, Mrs. Dietrich,
195, shot 3.

316
00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.280
You can't just ...

317
00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.280
Mr. Meyer, I am so sorry.

318
00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.000
I have tried
to talk to him.

319
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.640
What's going on, Meyer?

320
00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.560
Excuse me, Mr. Gamemaster.

321
00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:28.880
*ringing*

322
00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.440
Is that supposed to be playing the piano?
I'm supposed to sing to this filth?

323
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.800
Who is the lady?

324
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.400
This is...
*He turns the page.

325
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:43.960
Dietrich.

326
00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.120
Dietrich?

327
00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:48.760
Marlene Dietrich, you cretin!

328
00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:56.160
What are you doing here?
I'm from Vice.

329
00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.760
Talk to you.
Here or in the Presidium.

330
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.760
(game master) Meyer, can we
continue now, please!

331
00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.160
Jesus Christ!

332
00:27:05.560 --> 00:27:08.280
Connect me with Cologne. 1308.

333
00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:13.720
(Yes, please?
It's me.

334
00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:18.400
Only one copy of König's films was ever
only one copy was ever made.

335
00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:19.960
Is that safe?
 Yes.

336
00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.360
And the negative?

337
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.440
The negatives
are not stored there.

338
00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.560
The messenger has taken them
took them away again and again.

339
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.880
Can we get to the messenger?
Yes.

340
00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.840
I have vouched for myself,

341
00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:35.120
that we solve this problem
before the elections.

342
00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.120
I am aware of that, Father.

343
00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.640
All right,
keep me up to date.

344
00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:40.920
*Clack*

345
00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:56.000
*exciting music*

346
00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:13.400
Krajewski?

347
00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.680
Ah.

348
00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:16.640
It wasn't there yet.

349
00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:21.760
*exciting music*

350
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.960
(conductor)
Get on after Wedding!

351
00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.280
I have nothing new.

352
00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.360
But me.

353
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.280
I was at the copying plant.

354
00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.440
(conductor)
Stay behind after Wedding!

355
00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.800
*whistle*

356
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.800
(Get away from the doors!

357
00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:09.240
He's a cop!
A cop, comrades! Murderer!

358
00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.400
*They're talking all over the place.

359
00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:13.920
Traitors to the working class!

360
00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:20.000
(passenger) We don't want any ...
- (passengers) Schupo pigs!

361
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.920
*serious music

362
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.800
Then this.

363
00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.400
And that.

364
00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.960
And much more.

365
00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.440
What should I do?

366
00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.120
Nothing.

367
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.280
Absolutely nothing.

368
00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.400
But one day
that could change.

369
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.200
(whispers) Kardakov is outside.

370
00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.560
Who?

371
00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:09.320
(whispers) The violinist.

372
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:12.520
So, what does he want?
- (quietly) I don't know.

373
00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:19.240
He messes up my whole car.
He doesn't pay either.

374
00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.360
Mr. Kardakov,
what do you want from me?

375
00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.800
(weakly) I have something for you.

376
00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:32.560
*Kardakov groans.
Nothing understood.

377
00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.120
Gold.

378
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.600
The gold of the Sorokins.

379
00:30:43.880 --> 00:30:45.000
What?

380
00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.680
On my behalf?

381
00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.720
And you come to pick them up?
And where?

382
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.760
Police section 14,
Charlottenburg.

383
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:00.200
Thank you.
These are unfair methods,

384
00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.800
but I have no rank
and name to lose.

385
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.560
You're allowed to make
make a mistake.

386
00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.240
Impersonating the criminal investigation department
to impersonate

387
00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.680
and breaking into an apartment,
is not a mistake.

388
00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:14.880
But what?
That's worse.

389
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.720
You lied to me.
I didn't.

390
00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.400
They thought I was
Böhm's assistant.

391
00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:24.320
I just wanted to
to comply with your request.

392
00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:28.840
I also found something:
the bullet.

393
00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800
The colleague at the station
said ...

394
00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:34.800
This is not your colleague.
Sorry.

395
00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.160
Your colleague said,
that is caliber 6.35.

396
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.320
Mr. Commissioner. Mr. Rath.

397
00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.920
Don't be like that.

398
00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:48.680
That's all right.

399
00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:51.800
By the way ...

400
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.280
Alexei Kardakov
was still there last night.

401
00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:00.000
Where? In Berlin?
At Sorokina's apartment.

402
00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:04.600
He had forgotten the key.
The janitor told me.

403
00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.520
That means he actually
actually never left the city?

404
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:10.160
Looks like this.

405
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:11.760
Come here.
Where to?

406
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.200
Let's take a closer look at the
of the suitcase.

407
00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.880
I'll do it.

408
00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:19.720
*She whistles.

409
00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.280
Come and see us.

410
00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.400
And this?

411
00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.400
Ever heard of it?

412
00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.880
Tretschkow.

413
00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:49.680
Kardakov and Sorokina
play with Ilya Trechkov?

414
00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.920
I know him.

415
00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.920
Who is that?
A well-known bandmaster.

416
00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:56.880
He plays with Uncle Jim
in the "Dutchman".

417
00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.560
Always on Saturdays.

418
00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:00.600
This is today.

419
00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.920
Well, wonderful. Let's go there.

420
00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:04.480
We?

421
00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:07.560
Why should I take you with me?

422
00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.280
Because I know
where the "Dutchman" is.

423
00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.800
And not you.

424
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.160
Nobody would tell you
nobody would tell you.

425
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.120
Oh yes?
Yes, you are police.

426
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.440
Does he still eat it?

427
00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:34.840
Ortgies, caliber 6.35:
What does that tell you?

428
00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:36.760
Fits in with Kardakov.
Why?

429
00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.680
It's an operetta weapon.

430
00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:42.600
More likely to be used by people
who can't shoot.

431
00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.600
Musicians, artists, that kind of thing.

432
00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:47.240
*murmur of voices*

433
00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.720
Well, then ... Tonight
nine o'clock at the "Holländer".

434
00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600
Nine?

435
00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:56.840
We don't need to show up at the
not show up at the "Holländer".

436
00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.440
Well, then at midnight.

437
00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.000
Friedrichstraße S-Bahn station.
It's only a few steps from there.

438
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:09.400
I'm from the "Weltbühne",
accredited journalist.

439
00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.760
*murmur of voices*

440
00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.600
Greetings, Mr. Neighbor.
Mr. Katelbach.

441
00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:18.400
What's going on there?

442
00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:21.600
Your Prezidentsky is working
to save his honor:

443
00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:24.240
"The Reds
shot first."

444
00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.360
Unfortunately you miss
half of it out here.

445
00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.360
You wouldn't happen to know
a back door?

446
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:34.920
Sorry.

447
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.800
Sorry.

448
00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.360
*murmur of voices*

449
00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:44.680
It was not the police apparatus
incited the unrest here,

450
00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.520
but
the communist associations,

451
00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.680
without any respect
for the order of the state

452
00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:52.840
to the violent onslaught

453
00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.240
on the police deployed solely to de-escalate
deployed solely for de-escalation

454
00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.720
have called.

455
00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.760
I would like to
introduce you to a hero,

456
00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.960
to whom his courageous commitment
for law and order

457
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:09.680
by the trigger-happy Bolsheviks
with a hail of bullets.

458
00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.760
Constable Fritz Dörr.

459
00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:15.160
*mumble*
(Boo!

460
00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.840
(A true hero!

461
00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:19.920
A lie!

462
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.240
Bang.

463
00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.480
*applause*

464
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.520
In the name of the fatherland:
Thank you very much.

465
00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.320
*applause*
(Boo!

466
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.920
*She sighs.

467
00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:50.640
*Door opens.

468
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880
How do you do?

469
00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:55.400
I have an application:
Criminal Assistance.

470
00:35:55.280 --> 00:35:57.400
Department?
Murder.

471
00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.880
Do you have
a certificate of good conduct with you?

472
00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.000
No, I'll bring it.
Yes, put it in there.

473
00:36:05.560 --> 00:36:06.880
*she sighs.

474
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:17.840
"Vacancy for housemaid
available."

475
00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.760
"Regierungsrat Benda".

476
00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.120
Is that the accurate wording?
- Yes.

477
00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:31.640
Very good.

478
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.520
Beyond that
any findings?

479
00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.680
Unforeseen risks?

480
00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.680
I am invisible.

481
00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:43.800
For sure.

482
00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.400
You can't be sure.
Never.

483
00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:50.800
Of course.

484
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.280
You know
how sensitive this thing is.

485
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.520
At some point
the decisive clue is there.

486
00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.960
It's about
not to miss this moment.

487
00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.240
I know, Mr. Government Councillor.

488
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.280
You're doing well, Stefan.

489
00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.360
Thank you.

490
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.640
But remove "security"
from your vocabulary.

491
00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880
Yes.

492
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.760
*Rattling of a train, brakes

493
00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.320
*quick, tripping steps*

494
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.280
Sorry.

495
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.960
Gosh, you look good!

496
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.240
Charming.

497
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.720
Come and see us.

498
00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.800
*Spanish guitar music

499
00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:02.160
*She whistles.

500
00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.320
(man sings) "He who dares nothing,
nothing is gained."

501
00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:08.760
An evening.
An evening.

502
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.800
"Because nobody knows exactly
what the future holds."

503
00:38:14.320 --> 00:38:17.800
Bellissima!
What splendor in our hut.

504
00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.400
Are you coming?
powder your nose?

505
00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:22.120
I'll be right back.

506
00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.280
"I love you all the more

507
00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:28.360
and hold you close
in my dreams."

508
00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:33.760
"Then I'll only ever think about you."

509
00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.520
(guests sing) "Then he thinks
only ever thinks of you."

510
00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:39.880
"Then I'll think about you all the time."

511
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:43.720
(Guests sing) "Then think
think of me too."

512
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:50.960
"And tell me: My rose stay,
do not forget mine."

513
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.640
Mr. Commissioner?

514
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:11.680
Mr. Gräf!

515
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.120
I wasn't expecting you.

516
00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:16.880
(mischievously)
Neither do I with you.

517
00:39:18.240 --> 00:39:19.680
Sorry.

518
00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:21.320
And good evening.

519
00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:25.600
As always, a phenomenon.
I can only return the favor.

520
00:39:25.840 --> 00:39:28.960
Long time no see, darling.
All nice?

521
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.480
All chic. And yourself?
 Good.

522
00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:33.560
I drink the same as him.

523
00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.400
Lemonade for the lady.
(laughs) Wat?

524
00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:42.520
But with a shot, please. And you?
Thank you, I have to go to my family.

525
00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.400
Commissioner.

526
00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.120
*she sighs.

527
00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.880
Is that Trechkov?
Hm?

528
00:39:58.120 --> 00:39:59.200
On the stage?

529
00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.000
Yes, exactly.

530
00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:04.320
We meet him during the break.

531
00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.320
*slow flamenco music*

532
00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.400
Do we want to?

533
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.480
Oh, the Kardakov!

534
00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:20.280
Squanders his talent,
the idiot.

535
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.640
(Idiot.

536
00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.800
I hate him.

537
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.240
He's so gifted,
that you have to hate him.

538
00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.400
I said to him:
"You're our star."

539
00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:32.000
"Your crazy violin
is the devil's own."

540
00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:34.920
And he walks away
and plays revolution.

541
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.800
I hate him.
I hate this fortress.

542
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.560
The Red Fortress, yes?

543
00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:43.160
All madmen. They believe
they can overthrow Stalin.

544
00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:45.920
The whole thing is a horrible idiocy.

545
00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.440
And their leader, Trotsky,
is squatting in Turkey

546
00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.280
and wastes
other people's lives.

547
00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:55.440
And what about this countess,
Mrs. Sorokina?

548
00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:59.320
Oh, her! She made everything
only made things worse.

549
00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.400
(Oh no!
- Turned his head.

550
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.880
And then disappear with him.

551
00:41:05.120 --> 00:41:06.720
Pff, I hate them.

552
00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.800
Where could this Kardakov be?
- Overthrowing Stalin.

553
00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:14.960
I swore to him,
to keep it to myself, but ...

554
00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.560
Discretion
is not my passion.

555
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.600
In Köpenick.

556
00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.800
In the Wormsstraße.

557
00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:30.560
There's a hole in the cellar,
there's a print shop in it.

558
00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.120
And?

559
00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.000
The headquarters of the Red Fortress.

560
00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:40.720
*floating music*

561
00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.000
I love this song!
 Me too.

562
00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:54.800
What?
 Do you want to dance?

563
00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.680
Are you serious?

564
00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520
*floating music

565
00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:12.640
*She burps.

566
00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.320
Oh!
Are you actually married?

567
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.800
Uh, no.
But in firm hands.

568
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.520
It's not that easy
in my case.

569
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.000
"Love is very complicated."

570
00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.760
"Otherwise our Sigismund would not have
would not have made such a fool of himself."

571
00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
And you?
 Icke? A steady guy?

572
00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:31.320
That was still missing.

573
00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.640
Why do you see this everywhere,
except in Berlin?

574
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.720
We are more fixed
than the rest of the Schützenfest.

575
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.840
Always a quick answer.
Better than a slow silence.

576
00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:44.200
And always the last word.

577
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.760
No.

578
00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.160
*fast music

579
00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.240
*Lotte groans.

580
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:31.720
Phew.

581
00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:34.560
What time is it?

582
00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.800
I'll take you home now.

583
00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:41.000
*She laughs with a grunt.
Nah, but I have to go.

584
00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.640
No argument.

585
00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:46.800
That is really
very kind, Mr. Rath.

586
00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.720
But I still have plans.

587
00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.520
See you tomorrow.

588
00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:55.640
But home?

589
00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.600
Nope, but ...

590
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.000
does anyone actually pay me
anyone pay me for this?

591
00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.280
For my ... work?

592
00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.240
I have no idea.

593
00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:16.000
How?

594
00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.480
We are only just getting started.

595
00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.960
Good.

596
00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.280
Bye bye.
