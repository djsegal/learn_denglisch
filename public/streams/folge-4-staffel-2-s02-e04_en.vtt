00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.760
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.200
A foreman has discovered a human
foot in the foundation

4
00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.400
and recovered one dead body.

5
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.160
The man
was obviously a priest.

6
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.400
Already identified?
- St. Joseph.

7
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.280
A little reminder of your
exciting time in the capital.

8
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.640
I'm supposed to deliver this for
for Chief Superintendent Böhm.

9
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.760
Never flown before?
 No.

10
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.600
You are flying for the first time.

11
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.120
Come on!

12
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.200
These documents prove it,

13
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.320
that there is a German base
in the Soviet Union,

14
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.320
where German pilots are trained as
are trained as fighter pilots.

15
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.160
We have reliable
information,

16
00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.840
that they are planning to assassinate you.

17
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.480
Communists?
- National forces.

18
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.960
Mr. Benda is not a murderer.
- Is he that nice to you?

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.680
He has a good heart.

20
00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.320
He is also
the head of political affairs.

21
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920
You didn't say anything,
that you have a son.

22
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.600
Moritz is my nephew.

23
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.720
Make yourselves at home.

24
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.920
Charlotte.

25
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.280
He asks,
if you need a bed.

26
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520
If that were possible ...
No question.

27
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680
*surr*

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.640
*exciting music*

29
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:09.400
*surr*

30
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.840
*surr*

31
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.200
*Groans*

32
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.680
*Man and woman groan.

33
00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.000
*They cry out in horror.

34
00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.400
Stop!

35
00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Stop!

36
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400
Stop!

37
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.920
*surr*

38
00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.400
*uncanny music

39
00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.600
*rhythmic music

40
00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.800
*squeak*

41
00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.800
*The doorbell rings.

42
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.640
*The doorbell rings again.

43
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.520
Well, give it a rest,
there's nobody there.

44
00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:56.360
Always the hammering.

45
00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.480
They're deaf, golly!
You have to press there.

46
00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:02.480
On the light switch?
Yes.

47
00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.800
The son has
for the parents.

48
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800
*she sighs.

49
00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.800
Mr. Jänicke?

50
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.120
How do you do?

51
00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:33.880
May I come in?

52
00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.240
*mumble*

53
00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.600
Day.

54
00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.480
*mumble*

55
00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.720
Is this all because of us?

56
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:34.000
What happened?

57
00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.800
Gentlemen, thank you.

58
00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.280
Chief Superintendent Böhm
was already at the scene of the crime.

59
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.880
Mr. Böhm,
Please submit your report.

60
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.960
To make a long story short:
It was a well-aimed shot to the head.

61
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.760
Like an execution.

62
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:09.600
The Russians?

63
00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:13.640
The unusual make of the weapon
speaks against it.

64
00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:15.640
Very rare. A lignosis.

65
00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.320
Lignose?

66
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.360
Wait a minute. We were just talking about that.

67
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.320
The priest.

68
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:27.440
I have Mr. Ullrich
from the identification service

69
00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.880
the projectiles
examined immediately.

70
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.560
It was the same gun.
Is that safe?

71
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.120
The same or the same?

72
00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360
The same.

73
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:39.680
With this weapon

74
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:43.360
Stefan Jänicke
and Josef Wilczek were shot.

75
00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.840
No doubt about it.

76
00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:48.520
These are the two projectiles.
Lignose 6.35.

77
00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.360
We have
compared the fine lines,

78
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.120
that the barrel
of this specific weapon

79
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.880
on the surface
of the two projectiles.

80
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.240
As you can see
the picture is identical.

81
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.400
With the following method
we test our hypothesis:

82
00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:06.880
We moisten the projectiles
with ink

83
00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:11.440
and roll them gently but
carefully onto absorbent paper.

84
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:14.240
(Gennat) That's Jänicke,
the Wilczek?

85
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.240
Exactly. The same picture.

86
00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.600
Gentlemen ...

87
00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.680
There is something else,
that is strange:

88
00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:29.960
Both victims died
on their way to you

89
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.560
or had already reached you
had already arrived, Mr. Rath.

90
00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960
Please what?

91
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.920
Her nephew found Jänicke.

92
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.760
Just around the corner
of your new home.

93
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.800
Why don't I know anything about it?
You couldn't be reached.

94
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:50.200
You are, as we all know,
on a secret mission.

95
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.840
But do you still remember your meeting with Rev.
Wilczek do you still remember?

96
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:56.640
What are you talking about?

97
00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.560
That you were the last one
who saw him alive.

98
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.680
When is that supposed to have been?
Last Thursday.

99
00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:07.960
I've never seen the man.

100
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.800
They were being watched.
With Wolter and the holy bimbo.

101
00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:14.240
What's this nonsense?
That's enough!

102
00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.000
I only ask questions.

103
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.880
Please continue
constructively.

104
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:21.400
Why is he getting
the evidence,

105
00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:24.160
as soon as the body
is in the autopsy?

106
00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:27.880
The body of Jänicke
has not yet been autopsied.

107
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:31.240
The day before yesterday, the priest's corpse!
That's the one I'm talking about.

108
00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.440
Is that true, Mr. Rath?

109
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:39.160
I wanted to
help the chief inspector.

110
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.400
*He laughs.

111
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:45.960
If we don't keep order,
not even in the areas of responsibility,

112
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.720
then we are simply
a miserable bunch of bastards!

113
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.520
Not a murder investigation.

114
00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.120
We can't even find
the murderers of our colleagues.

115
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.000
And Mr. Chief Commissioner:

116
00:10:57.240 --> 00:11:00.440
Fate
is generally not inclined,

117
00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:04.480
to put the perpetrator in front of us
in front of us, and in the presidium to boot.

118
00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:07.800
Have the relatives
notified yet?

119
00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.360
I was there today.

120
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.760
(Gennat) See you tomorrow morning
a detailed report:

121
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.840
Crime scene analysis, witness examination ...

122
00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.840
Reconstruct every
- and really every - step

123
00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:24.280
from Stefan Jänicke to the deed.

124
00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:27.400
This case has the highest priority.

125
00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.360
Gentlemen,
let's get back to work.

126
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.640
Thank you, Chief Commissioner Böhm.

127
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.640
*exciting music*

128
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.400
(All right, then.

129
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.360
Stefan Jänicke was a mole.

130
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.160
Who did he work for?

131
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.120
For me.

132
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.880
Who or what was he after?

133
00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.440
There is an operation.
An operation called Prangertag.

134
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.400
What is behind it?
An assassination plan.

135
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.840
We do not yet
we don't know yet.

136
00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:27.840
The French Foreign Minister
is in town.

137
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.200
I am responsible for his safety
responsible.

138
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.960
Stefan Jänicke
had this notebook.

139
00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:38.000
Before he died, he urgently
tried to reach me.

140
00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:40.960
We must
find his records.

141
00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.320
The book wasn't with him?
No.

142
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.800
When will we get
the recordings from Lipetsk?

143
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:51.320
Gräf is already in the lab.

144
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.760
Miss,
these files have to come out quickly.

145
00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.920
Yes, Mr. Government Councillor.

146
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.600
*She sobs.

147
00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:27.800
*She sobs.

148
00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.640
It's my fault.

149
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:37.520
Please?

150
00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:43.520
Stefan was here because of me.
With us. In the commission.

151
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:48.440
(gently) No, that's not true.

152
00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:50.440
It was the other way around.

153
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.960
They are here because of him.

154
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.240
Hmm?

155
00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:12.960
Can I help you?
I'm looking for his notebook.

156
00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640
The red one?
 Yes.

157
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.640
He always had it with him.

158
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.160
It wasn't with his body.

159
00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.880
Who killed Stefan?

160
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.920
The Russians?

161
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.280
But who then?

162
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.920
Jänicke was exposed.
As an informer.

163
00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.240
What?

164
00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.920
In-house.

165
00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:59.640
Who was he set on?
I don't know.

166
00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.880
But you have a suspicion?

167
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.280
Well, who did he work for?

168
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.440
The ...

169
00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.160
That's nonsense,
I don't believe it.

170
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.120
Why would Wolter ...
I don't know.

171
00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:22.800
We need his notebook.

172
00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.400
Good.

173
00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:31.160
*exciting music*

174
00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:42.800
An evening.
 An evening.

175
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.160
*quick steps

176
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.400
We searched everything.
There was no notebook.

177
00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.320
Nowhere.

178
00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:22.920
*noises*

179
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.840
Gereon!
(whispers) Quiet!

180
00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:37.000
Get Moritz.
Then pack your things.

181
00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.240
What?

182
00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.520
We have to get out of here.
Pack up, now!

183
00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:43.400
But why?

184
00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.800
Let's go now!

185
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.200
Go, go, go!

186
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:50.800
*exciting music*

187
00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.680
(Quiet!

188
00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.600
Gereon.

189
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.400
The policeman,
I found ...

190
00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.800
Did he live in the area?

191
00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:28.400
No, he didn't.

192
00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:35.960
Did he want to see the chief commissioner?

193
00:19:36.520 --> 00:19:37.720
No.

194
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.000
He wanted to see me.

195
00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.280
Are you sure?

196
00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800
Yes.

197
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.160
That's right.

198
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.880
Good night, Moritz.

199
00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.760
Night.

200
00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.440
*noise*

201
00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:37.400
(quietly) That way.

202
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.840
Sorry, doll.
Couldn't earlier.

203
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:54.800
When will
the gentlemen come back?

204
00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:57.560
(whispers) So in two hours.
Shoes off.

205
00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.920
Nonsense.
- Not so loud.

206
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.200
The children are asleep.
Come in.

207
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:04.680
*They laugh.

208
00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.160
This way.

209
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.640
Comm.

210
00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:30.240
*She whoops.

211
00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:31.520
Psh!

212
00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.120
*They laugh.

213
00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:34.520
This way.

214
00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.720
Fritz, where are you going?

215
00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.960
And where do they sleep?
- Above. Psch.

216
00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:48.520
Ah. Ick ...

217
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.400
*He laughs.

218
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.280
Psch.

219
00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.280
What's there?

220
00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.600
The dining room.
- Oh.

221
00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.640
Fritz, please,
we can't go that way.

222
00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:12.920
Are you crazy?!

223
00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.280
The old man's study.

224
00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:32.400
Come on.
- No. That's enough now.

225
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.640
Come on.
- No. Enough!

226
00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.560
*She laughs.

227
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:40.480
Come, come, come, come!

228
00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:05.880
*thunder roll

229
00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:08.720
Come here.

230
00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.880
*Rain pattering.

231
00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:51.440
*They groan.

232
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.600
When did you start smoking?

233
00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.280
Since just now.

234
00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.960
What have we fled from?

235
00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.920
I can't tell you.
You are safe here.

236
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.880
From whom?

237
00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.280
Does that have anything
to do with your secret mission?

238
00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:34.480
You were gone.
I don't know where.

239
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680
*He sighs.

240
00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.720
I was in Russia.

241
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.240
In Russia?!

242
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.720
How did you get there
there so quickly?

243
00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.560
By airplane.

244
00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:52.000
You have flown with an airplane
flown in an airplane?

245
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:54.520
Yes.

246
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.360
How is that? Flying.

247
00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.360
Shaky.

248
00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.640
*Church clock strikes.

249
00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.160
Come and see me.

250
00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.400
Do you hear me?

251
00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:36.400
*Road noise

252
00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.800
Everything sounds different than at home.

253
00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.480
I emptied my savings account,
signed Moritz out of school,

254
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:04.360
at Margarethe's
two large suitcases.

255
00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.760
Your father knows nothing.

256
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.760
If you want to,
we can start again.

257
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.400
Here in Berlin.

258
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.600
Do you want to?

259
00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:32.640
*quiet piano music

260
00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:44.600
*quiet piano music

261
00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:53.720
*She knocks.
Rudi?

262
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.800
*A woman whoops inside.

263
00:27:11.400 --> 00:27:12.520
*A woman giggles.

264
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:25.560
Charlotte.

265
00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.720
How nice.
Sorry.

266
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.800
I actually just wanted
just get some sleep.

267
00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:34.880
But I'm probably interrupting.
Not at all.

268
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.120
This is Erika.

269
00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.120
And that's ...
- It's a pill.

270
00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:44.280
Comm.

271
00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.920
Another time, yes?

272
00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.760
*quiet piano music

273
00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.880
*quiet piano music

274
00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.680
*Church clock strikes.

275
00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:37.320
*street noise

276
00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:58.800
I used to think
that my mother didn't like me,

277
00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:02.000
because I'm different from them
or Ilse or Toni.

278
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:05.680
It starts with her hair.
She never wanted to comb it.

279
00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.960
"There's nothing to comb -
Fluffy hair," she said.

280
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.600
Too thin, too dark ...
My sisters are lighter.

281
00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:15.520
But that's not so bad.

282
00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:19.000
I mean,
Ilse brought me up anyway.

283
00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:21.520
The way I look after
take care of Toni now.

284
00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:23.200
To your mother.

285
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.280
May she rest in peace.

286
00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:31.320
It does not rest.

287
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.640
I used to believe that too,

288
00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.560
that I was switched
at birth.

289
00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.800
But?
It was a home birth.

290
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.560
(laughs) Then it gets difficult.

291
00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.520
Bruno?

292
00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800
Mhm.

293
00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.520
Did you kill him?

294
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.400
Who?

295
00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:12.880
Stefan.

296
00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.400
Stefan?

297
00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.480
Jänicke?

298
00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.920
Who says so?

299
00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.320
Did you?

300
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.640
No, of course not.
No?

301
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:30.240
No!
Swear it.

302
00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:33.000
*He sighs.
Why should I...?

303
00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.920
(quieter) Why should I
kill Jänicke?

304
00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.560
Swear it, Bruno.

305
00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:40.760
*He laughs.

306
00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:44.120
Yes, I swear.
I didn't kill him.

307
00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:45.960
*She exhales loudly.

308
00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.560
I swear to you.

309
00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.320
My wife's life.

310
00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.520
*removed music

311
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.480
*slow music*

312
00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:45.320
# Every woman dreams once
of sin.

313
00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.920
# Of the most beautiful night,
that must come.

314
00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.400
# Every woman
has some longing

315
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.400
after a sweet
and forbidden kiss.

316
00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.880
(Bruno?

317
00:33:24.440 --> 00:33:25.440
Bruno?

318
00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.680
*Emmi screams out.

319
00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:04.840
Gereon.
 Emmi.

320
00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.880
How did you
come in here?

321
00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.760
Well, with the key.

322
00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.640
I shouted too.

323
00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:14.520
I wanted to bring it back.

324
00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.960
Yes ...

325
00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:20.720
Don't tell him anything, will you?

326
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.600
But neither did you,
that I scared you so much.

327
00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.560
You weren't even here.

328
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.400
*She laughs.

329
00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.440
See you soon.

330
00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.800
Yes.

331
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400
Psch.

332
00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.160
Gereon, what are you doing here?
Closing time already?

333
00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.800
I know all about it, Bruno.

334
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600
Why?

335
00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:07.280
I saw that,
you've moved out.

336
00:36:07.520 --> 00:36:10.640
Why can't you find out?
Answer the question!

337
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.280
Have you already
found something suitable?

338
00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.240
Why did you shoot
Father Wilczek shot?

339
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.600
*exciting music*

340
00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.560
With the service weapon,
I suppose.

341
00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:39.360
Why else would you have
replace the balls?

342
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.800
That was a mistake.

343
00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:46.400
And you shouldn't have
Krajewski's gun.

344
00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.640
The lignose.

345
00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:49.800
You're absolutely right.

346
00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.760
But now we have
two corpses.

347
00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.520
And all the evidence points
point to a Cologne cop,

348
00:36:56.760 --> 00:37:00.560
the temptations of the big city
of the big city.

349
00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:03.400
And in a drug frenzy
first a priest

350
00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:06.920
and then shoots his own
shoots his own assistant.

351
00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.320
How are you going to get away with it?

352
00:37:12.920 --> 00:37:15.440
Let me worry about that
worry about that, friend.

353
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:19.160
Greetings to wife and child.

354
00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.440
Recommend me.

355
00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:41.600
* angry scream*

356
00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:43.240
What an asshole!

357
00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:51.440
Shorthand.

358
00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.480
All shorthand.

359
00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.320
*He sighs.

360
00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:06.760
Mr. Rath, what's going on?
Where are we going?

361
00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.560
Come and see us.

362
00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.760
What?
I've got it.

363
00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.800
Where was it?

364
00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:28.800
At Wolter's. At his home.

365
00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:30.280
What?

366
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.360
I found it
I found it in his desk.

367
00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.880
That can't be right.

368
00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:37.960
It was him.

369
00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.920
How can ... How can
you be so sure?

370
00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.440
Firstly: The examination
by the identification service.

371
00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.600
Secondly, I know
where he got the gun.

372
00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.400
And thirdly ...

373
00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:52.680
Charlotte, i...

374
00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:57.520
I tried to use a bullet
from this very gun

375
00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.560
a suspicion
from myself.

376
00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.360
What kind of suspicion?

377
00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:06.840
I can read almost nothing in it.
It's all in shorthand.

378
00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.520
You have to
for me.

379
00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:10.920
Here?

380
00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:14.360
No. Put it away
and drive home.

381
00:39:14.600 --> 00:39:16.840
And go through it there
at your leisure.

382
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:18.720
Good.

383
00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:21.640
We can no longer trust
trust anyone here.

384
00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:26.320
Thank you.

385
00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.440
*exciting music*

386
00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:50.760
*exciting music*

387
00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:45.520
You can't watch that.

388
00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.720
Thank you.

389
00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:56.600
When did you get here?
Spittelmarkt.

390
00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.200
Well, man, I think
you need a schnapps.

391
00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:10.520
Come on, let's go to "Clärchens".
I've got a lid there.

392
00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:13.560
Do we want to?
 Yes.

393
00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:19.920
I don't really have time.
Neither do I.

394
00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.920
What are you doing?
Come on. In you go, doll!

395
00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.160
*She coughs.
