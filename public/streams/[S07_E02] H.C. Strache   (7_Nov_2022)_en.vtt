00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.040
.

2
00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.320
# You are the one for me
for me

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.640
For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.800
You are my love
Very, very, very veritable #

5
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.560
So, let's see,

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.200
what the cat today
put in front of the door.

7
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.200
Hans-Christian Strache, 53 years
old, trained dental technician,

8
00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.280
former party leader of the FPÖ
and from 2017 to 2019 Minister of Sport

9
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.480
and Vice Chancellor
of the Republic of Austria.

10
00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.360
Known in Germany
mainly because of a vacation in Ibiza.

11
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.120
Mr. Strache? Yes?

12
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.120
And, are you happy again,
that you are back home in the realm?

13
00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
No, I would not have
not all cups in the cupboard,

14
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.720
who here any
reunion

15
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.280
or other
crazy ideas.

16
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.040
But I see especially
many hidden cameras.

17
00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.440
I feel comfortable there.

18
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.240
I would have expected a
expected a different answer.

19
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.120
So, moin.
Good evening.

20
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.520
Hello Mr. Strache.
Good day, Mr. Krömer.

21
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.640
Are you also taking something here?
I'm looking at the time.

22
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.360
Are you recording? Are you pressed for time?
No, but the half hour.

23
00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:24.160
Please? The half hour,
I'm looking forward to it.

24
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.480
And then you go, or what?
Are you afraid of being cut?

25
00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.360
That you then look bad
perhaps after the recording?

26
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.720
Well, that is
guaranteed with you.

27
00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.760
That we cut in such a way that you
come across like a right-wing radical?

28
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.160
That's what I expected.

29
00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.080
That is almost pathological with you.
almost pathological. rbb.

30
00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.560
H. C. Strache knows no
in Germany,

31
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240
but everyone the Ibiza man.

32
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.280
That's a success too, isn't it?

33
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.760
Well, in life there are always
successes, ups and downs.

34
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.440
I have experienced both.

35
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.880
But more depths?
I would not say so.

36
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.840
Because now the lowest point
has been reached, so to speak.

37
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.560
The beauty is:
Things can only go up.

38
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.600
Dead, that is, not only clinically,
but completely dead.

39
00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.120
Already underground.
Shut up, monkey dead.

40
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.120
You see, I am alive.
Unlike Jörg Haider.

41
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.360
And what are you doing professionally now?

42
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.880
I am active as an entrepreneur,
do development projects.

43
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.680
What are you doing?
Hiking days, or what?

44
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.320
Yes, with you perhaps with pleasure,
maybe even in Ibiza. Aha.

45
00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.680
I could think of better things.

46
00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.280
When you were 15 years old
you became a member

47
00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.600
of the beating german-national
student fraternity

48
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.120
Viennese pennal fraternity
Vandalia.

49
00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.960
Did you beat Mensur?

50
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.880
Yes, that's the way it is with us. I
I have beaten several scales.

51
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.960
Where now? On the back, in the
chest, in the finger?

52
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.760
The nice thing is,
I was quite successful

53
00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.880
and have not collected a smack.

54
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.880
Have you had surgery,
I see nothing?

55
00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.040
No, I did not collect one.
How? I was quite successful.

56
00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.080
I only dealt and
fortunately none collected.

57
00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.520
They share out more like that.
Well, not today.

58
00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.080
Today I would probably
handed out.

59
00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.800
Now let's move on to a topic
that I'm sure you're very proud of:

60
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.320
Wehrsportübungen
with the fraternity.

61
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.120
Some of these photos you brought
yourself to the public.

62
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.560
Does that work in Austria?
Do you get voters with something like that?

63
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.640
Certainly not.

64
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.840
When you're young, you get
flattened here and there.

65
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.600
Not only in my youth,
as you know with me.

66
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.360
Yes, but you did not take the photos
not in your youth

67
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.840
given to the public,
but already in adulthood.

68
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.840
You know the back story?
I was blackmailed at the time.

69
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.880
And I will not be blackmailed.

70
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.480
What were you blackmailed with?
With these pictures. I see. Exactly.

71
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.960
Then you went on the offensive
and reveal the pictures?

72
00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.480
After all, I have done nothing
to be ashamed of.

73
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.520
But you were blackmailed
and have taken the initiative.

74
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.960
Exactly.
So it was already unpleasant.

75
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:05.040
Of course, someone intended
to make me look unpleasant.

76
00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.000
But that is
not possible with me.

77
00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.320
Don't suit you,
unpleasant stories, aren't they?

78
00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.160
They fit very well, as you know.

79
00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.320
I am a person
with many faults.

80
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.640
Yes, actually only with errors.
Well, fortunately not only.

81
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.160
We have been researching here
for days. Positive things...

82
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.840
Rare, isn't it? Very rare.
I can imagine that for you.

83
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.440
New Year's Eve 1989 you were

84
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.280
with the now banned
neo-Nazi Wiking Youth

85
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.320
with torches at the German-German border and ended up in
border and ended up in jail.

86
00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.760
What was. Lantern parade,
or what were you doing there?

87
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.560
Jail was not. That was the
Family Circle of Volkstreue Youth.

88
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.320
That was his name at the time. He met
here at the zone border.

89
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.160
With torches. As you rightly say.
Because there is also an amalgamation of...

90
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.800
Was it so dark,
or why did you have torches?

91
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.600
Well, New Year's Eve and when it is dark
you have torches. Say.

92
00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.520
I have never been on New Year's Eve
with a torch on the road.

93
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.200
When at the zone border...

94
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.800
Did you have the flares so that you could see the
see the zone border better?

95
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.720
We met there and
were then taken by the Federal Border Guard

96
00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.400
taken into custody.

97
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.040
To jail for the night.

98
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.200
Yes, nice New Year's Eve. Was there a swastika
Pouring lead then also a swastika?

99
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.360
No, certainly not. No?

100
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.920
No, on this subject I have
a very clear demarcation

101
00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.080
found in my life,

102
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.760
because I am familiar with the crimes
of the National Socialist regime

103
00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.680
not only wants nothing to do,

104
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.280
but for me this also
an abominable...

105
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.000
So flawless Nazi,
but without the swastika.

106
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:38.680
No, I am not a socialist
and not an extremist

107
00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.320
and therefore not a Nazi.

108
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.760
Strongly right-wing, without being a Nazi
and without a swastika.

109
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:47.440
No, you're trying to be
to be funny

110
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.640
and in Stasi manner,
to put things in the room.

111
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.400
Matching the backdrop.

112
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:57.600
Well, it has GDR charm here.
That's true.

113
00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.120
But I was born in West Berlin.

114
00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.760
But if you come with Nazi accusations
and thus a relativization

115
00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.680
of the most atrocious crime
in the history of mankind,

116
00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.080
then I say, that's neurotic,
that's antisocial.

117
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:14.120
But that also cheered you up a bit, didn't it?
fired up, right?

118
00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.880
You keep coming back to
foreigners, external borders.

119
00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.640
I think that...
What time is it?

120
00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.840
Your cell phone has gone out.
We have the time.

121
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.360
We Germans always get in line
when it comes to Nazis, don't we?

122
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.280
I have the impression that
in Austria, this is quite normal.

123
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.760
Hitler is a German problem,
isn't it?

124
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.960
That was probably a common
problem we had.

125
00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:41.640
This madness hit us together.

126
00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.840
You always go against the Nazis like this.
Do you want to redeem yourself now?

127
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.400
Or is this the new career
of H.C. Strache,

128
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.440
that you now want to become the
want to become the sympathetic dictator?

129
00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.680
I do not want to become a dictator
and say:

130
00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.960
"Once your reputation is ruined,
it's easy to live without a care in the world."

131
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.320
I do not have to be
be sympathetic to you.

132
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.480
The fact is, I have
always distinguished myself.

133
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.480
You could say you were a
Nazi and want to get away from it.

134
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.160
I was someone who moved in a
right-wing extremist scene,

135
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.760
but not a Nazi.

136
00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:12.520
By a stupid coincidence
or deliberately?

137
00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:16.040
You have to know the personal history
of each person.

138
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.880
We don't want to hear them now.
Sure, I understand.

139
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.280
I have looked at everything
at all possible parties

140
00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:25.040
and was also
in these circles, among others.

141
00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:28.600
Yes, in 2004, for example.
That's when your political rise began.

142
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.360
That's when you became head of the Vienna FPÖ

143
00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.920
and member of the
Federal Executive Committee of the party.

144
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.640
The leader of the FPÖ
was Jörg Haider at the time.

145
00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.640
He was the chairman, but not the leader.
And yes, he was quite successful.

146
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.920
Did you have something with him?
No, I didn't. Did you?

147
00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.720
No, not me. It's possible..,
that you have fucked yourself up there.

148
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.720
No. Was it like this? No.
That was not my approach.

149
00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:59.120
Also right-wing populist,
right-wing extremist worldview,

150
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.760
extremely racist, anti-Semitic,
had good connections

151
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:05.560
to Saddam Hussein and Gaddafi.

152
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.640
Great company.
These are prejudices, of course.

153
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.240
Did you know about it?
When you start with conscious...

154
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:15.600
That he was a right-wing radical?
That is not a prejudice.

155
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:18.960
...insinuations anti-Semitism,
extremism come...

156
00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.440
Well, it is already
a radical right-wing party.

157
00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.840
I understand:
Anyone who speaks German,

158
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.880
is a family man, not a communist,
is a Nazi for you.

159
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.200
But that is your
ideological component.

160
00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.400
No, Nazis are always those
who rail against foreigners,

161
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.840
that they can't get in here,
anti-Semites.

162
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.320
No, I have no problem against
people, no matter where they come from.

163
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.560
This is not a question
of culture and origin.

164
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.000
But you are the H.C. Strache
from Austria who was with the FPÖ,

165
00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.120
or did we make a mistake
the wrong bell?

166
00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.360
Yes, the "Ösi". To be honest,
who does not want to integrate,

167
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.320
I have a destination for him:
Off to the homeland, good flight!

168
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.360
We have enough unemployed people ourselves.

169
00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.600
Was that now
a slogan from the past?

170
00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.880
A memory of a
musical legal piece.

171
00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:03.320
The definition is: decent
people are always welcome,

172
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:07.000
but we don't want indecent ones,
We have enough of them ourselves.

173
00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.520
That's clearly Nazi-speak.
No, that's your...

174
00:09:09.680 --> 00:09:12.160
They only want Germans
and Austrians.

175
00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.160
Not the others?
No, not that.

176
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.000
We want people,
who abide by the laws...

177
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.440
The clock has gone out. You have to
tell me when we stop.

178
00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.680
Today you have used so little
primitive fecal language used,

179
00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.320
that almost disappoints me.

180
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:27.000
After all, we're only on question 7.

181
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.440
The FPÖ's puppet master was
was Herbert Kickl,

182
00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.200
the current party chairman.

183
00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:34.440
He wrote, among other things, the speeches
of you and Jörg Haider.

184
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.440
He does not believe that himself.

185
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.120
Were you and Haider
Kickl's puppets?

186
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.760
No, on the contrary. He wrote neither
for Jörg Haider or for me.

187
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.280
Have you learned by heart,
what he wrote,

188
00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.120
or read from the teleprompter?

189
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.400
No, he has not written for
none of us.

190
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.280
Who is this man?
What does he do?

191
00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:55.000
He was a speaker for Jörg Haider,

192
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.480
and Haider obviously had a
better knowledge of human nature than I do.

193
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.480
He left him as a consultant,
while I promoted him.

194
00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.720
Did you write your speeches
yourself?

195
00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:07.520
Yes of course, also held and
not read, held free.

196
00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.640
Because that is something
that a politician should live.

197
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.360
They doubt climate change,
want a headscarf ban,

198
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.480
Reject adoption for gays.

199
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.640
So left wing of the NSDAP?
Again such a bullshit!

200
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.760
I do not doubt climate change,
it is a reality,

201
00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:26.680
even if you want to
want to imply otherwise.

202
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.920
Adoption among gays?
Yes, I find that critical.

203
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.160
Everyone should live his sexuality
that is a private matter.

204
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:39.360
But at home,
no one will know.

205
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.680
No, each as he wants.
Even in public? Sure.

206
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.280
But when it comes to subsidies,
promotion,

207
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.200
then we want to promote children.

208
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.680
And these can only arise biologically
between a man and a woman.

209
00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.760
The gay couple
can adopt children after all,

210
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.560
who are not doing so well,
orphans.

211
00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:00.720
Adopt is legally possible,
but they are not conceived.

212
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:04.880
After all, we want to support children,
who give us a future.

213
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:09.840
If I, as a gay man, adopt a child
from an orphanage,

214
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.160
then the child
future with me.

215
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.400
Yes, but it was
not conceived by you.

216
00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.040
What's the point of that?
A child is a child after all.

217
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.920
Every child belongs
and supported. There you go.

218
00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.720
But the ability to procreate in
society belongs to be promoted.

219
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:29.560
But if there is a child standing here now
who has lost mother and father,

220
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.440
I don't care then, because
I have not begotten it?

221
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:40.080
You're trying to be funny.
No. As an artificial character.

222
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:44.520
But the fact is, children give us
future. That's what it's all about.

223
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.160
That's bullshit.

224
00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.360
Sexuality does not need
not subsidize,

225
00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.240
everyone should do it the way he wants.

226
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.440
Subsidize sexuality?
What kind of world do you live in?

227
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.760
Quick question: What league are you in
are you in on Clash of Clans?

228
00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:04.160
Cristal, champion
or even legend?

229
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:08.160
Yes, with my dear son
I have been playing this for many years.

230
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.840
We are legends, yes.

231
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.320
Is your son also with you?
Yes, he is with us.

232
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.200
Who spent the thousands of euros
spent? Your son also with?

233
00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.520
Me. And I paid for that privately
and no one else.

234
00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.320
Are you blaming this on your son?

235
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.760
No, I paid for that privately.
I like to do that with my son.

236
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:28.320
Thousands of euros?
Yes, that cost money.

237
00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:32.680
Now only legend after you
paid 3000 euros per month?

238
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:35.080
It took 7 years or more.

239
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.760
Jörg Haider left
left the FPÖ in 2005.

240
00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:41.360
Just between us, were you glad
that the fascist was finally gone?

241
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:44.960
He was not a "fascist.
Why did he leave?

242
00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.080
There was a rift,
as you know.

243
00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.760
We made an agreement,
to which he unfortunately did not adhere.

244
00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:54.960
Then there was a party split.
Aha.

245
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.760
After his departure you
raised up the party again

246
00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:03.040
and took, among other things, the commitment
to the German national community

247
00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.680
into the FPÖ program.

248
00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:06.880
Are we brothers?
No, that is wrong.

249
00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:10.720
We are in a common
language and cultural community,

250
00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:13.560
do not happen to speak
the same language.

251
00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:15.880
I guess that's what it expresses.

252
00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.760
We speak the same language,
period.

253
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.240
Well point, that's... Whether we
have a common culture...

254
00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:27.120
We sit here together
at the table and just get along.

255
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.520
Let's move on to a
very embarrassing video of you.

256
00:13:30.680 --> 00:13:32.520
You suspect what's coming? Well.

257
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:36.280
An important Austrian
politician, not Hitler,

258
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:38.480
has wished for the following:

259
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.280
Yes, it is also my wish
that in the future hopefully

260
00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:48.360
a new chancellor
named Petry becomes possible.

261
00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.920
Did you really think
that you would become chancellor?

262
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.720
It worked out great.

263
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.040
In Germany they say,
"two fools, one thought".

264
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.440
With the bird Hitler
I want and have nothing to do with.

265
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:10.880
Because of this allusion.
But you can make a wish.

266
00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.360
The fact that not all wishes come true
that is unfortunately the case.

267
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.720
You have something against Hitler,
but you are still a Nazi.

268
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.840
No, I am certainly not a Nazi.

269
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.080
If I am a Nazi,
you are a Stalinist. Why?

270
00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.000
Because you have the mind of a
Bolshevik in front of you.

271
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.040
I was born in West Berlin.

272
00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.280
This is what Marxists
and communists have in common:

273
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.800
They try to criminalize
to criminalize dissenters.

274
00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:39.400
Why should I be a Stalinist?
You'll have to explain that to me.

275
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.280
They try to use the term
"Nazi" to criminalize people.

276
00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:47.600
I find it outrageous when you relativize
relativize these crimes in this way.

277
00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:52.000
You are trying to
with such terminology...

278
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.400
Singular, a human being.
A Nazi is sitting in front of me.

279
00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:58.920
A bullshit,
but you know that yourself.

280
00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.040
What's embarrassing about this,
I do not understand, but good.

281
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.720
Ingrid? Do you also see
Mr. Strache's watch?

282
00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:07.360
That we stop early,
otherwise there will be stress.

283
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:11.280
On December 18, 2017 followed the
highlight of your political career

284
00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.800
You were appointed Vice Chancellor
of the Republic of Austria

285
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.680
and Minister for
Public Service and Sports.

286
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.320
That sounds like
political ball pool.

287
00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.800
Didn't they think you had a decent
Ministerial office?

288
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.120
(Strache laughs) The Chancellor...
But that was an uptight laugh.

289
00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:33.120
That was not uptight,
You're really funny.

290
00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:37.240
You almost give me
you almost have Stockholm syndrome.

291
00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:43.160
You do not laugh honestly with me,
which then pleases me in turn.

292
00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:47.520
The fact is different:
That a federal and a vice chancellor

293
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:50.360
for the generalization...
Joke Chancellor?

294
00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:54.040
...for the entire work
of the government are responsible,

295
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.400
have to take care of all subject contents.

296
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.000
Naturally, you try to
to take a portfolio,

297
00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:03.320
where you are not only
one department is concentrated.

298
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:06.600
Sports were wonderful.
I come from a competitive sport background.

299
00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.240
Gave me pleasure.

300
00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.280
How, you have taken
taken an office,

301
00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:12.120
where you didn't have to do so much?

302
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.400
No, that was wonderful
to promote the sport in Austria.

303
00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.840
So that you still had time
for Clash of Clans?

304
00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.040
This was not promoted for a long time,
not even the next generation.

305
00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:24.080
In Austria, the government subsidizes
the government subsidizes newspapers,

306
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.840
by placing advertisements.

307
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:29.200
Chancellor Kurz is said to have used that
to force the newspaper,

308
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.200
print fake surveys.

309
00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.160
Isn't that more clever,
than your attempt,

310
00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.120
the newspaper to Russian oligarchs
to Russian oligarchs?

311
00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:40.240
No, nonsense. I couldn't sell
I couldn't sell a newspaper.

312
00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.520
We both know,
because of the 7 Hours documentary,

313
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.400
that I am not corrupt.

314
00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:49.800
Do you have an Ibiza feeling now
from all the cameras here? No.

315
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.640
Are you all right, Mr. Strache?

316
00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.320
I would have been pleased
if you had been there.

317
00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.560
For example, dressed as an oligarch.
Do you want to see my feet?

318
00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:01.800
No, not your dirty toenails.
I have very beautiful feet.

319
00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.840
Ah, very good. Wonderful.
Speaking of Russia.

320
00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.960
Who is the one on your right?

321
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:16.240
This was a state visit of the
Russian President in Austria

322
00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.440
There were several state visits.

323
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.480
Now my question:
The picture in the background,

324
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.880
is that hanging upside down or
are you hanging from the ceiling?

325
00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.160
That was in the Chancellor's office,

326
00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:34.320
and he had this work of art,
that hangs upside down on purpose.

327
00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.360
I have to laugh now.

328
00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.520
The chancellor was too stupid
to see that? No, that's the way it should be.

329
00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.400
This is a work of art,
that is deliberately...

330
00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:48.120
Must have cost 100,000 euros.
He's got you fooled.

331
00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:50.000
You'll have to ask him.

332
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.840
You and the flawless democrat
Vladimir Putin.

333
00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.280
Does the FPÖ pay
do you get your salary in rubles?

334
00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.240
No, you get your salary
paid in euros, as is the case here.

335
00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:06.800
What about
with the friendship?

336
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.200
You have just received
got a message.

337
00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.560
Your serious? You have a message
from Clash of Clans.

338
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.440
There you go, probably
I'll be fit again in a moment.

339
00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.520
Oh, that's why you have the cell phone on.
Of course. Always on air.

340
00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:23.960
You are still addicted? With
I play together with my son.

341
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:25.600
Yes, I stand by that.

342
00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.680
I hope you also have children
and will be with them

343
00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:30.360
also do certain things.

344
00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.760
But not Clash of Clans.
You are already a funny bird.

345
00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:36.120
Yes, fortunately.
You have to keep a sense of humor.

346
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:39.200
No, that's not what I meant.
I don't feel like laughing.

347
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.880
On May 17, 2019
published "The Mirror

348
00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:45.360
and the "Süddeutsche Zeitung"
then the famous Ibiza video.

349
00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:49.160
You have repeatedly criticized,
that from 7 hours of video only a few,

350
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.720
particularly harmful moments
are shown.

351
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:55.120
I find that journalistically
and unfair in human terms.

352
00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.440
That's why I'm doing
that way now, too.

353
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.560
Look, as soon as she takes over the
Kronen-Zeitung takes over,

354
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.680
as soon as that is the case,
we have to talk quite openly.

355
00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.520
That's where we need to hunker down,
have to say:

356
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:11.920
There are with us in the crown:
bang, bang, bang, 3-4 people,

357
00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.920
they need to be pushed, 3-4
people who need to be dumped.

358
00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.960
You've already had
one in the crown easily, didn't you?

359
00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.320
Yes, I miss
the word "Red Bull" today.

360
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.840
But yes, I already had
one in the crown already.

361
00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.080
Anything else you want to say?

362
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.760
The thing is through, isn't it?
There's nothing more you can say.

363
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.760
But, fortunately, there is the
7 hours of complete documentation.

364
00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.640
Even if no one has desire
to look at them.

365
00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.480
But it shows that I
I am not for sale.

366
00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:47.800
You don't? But you have made
made a few offers,

367
00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.840
who are "morally flexible".

368
00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.440
Which at least rumors
have revealed,

369
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.000
which are obviously
confirmed with other parties.

370
00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:00.400
How? With donations. But you
have built the shit, haven't you?

371
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.920
Why do you now go
to other parties?

372
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.080
No, I also talk there
about rumors from other parties, yes.

373
00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:07.760
But we are talking about you.

374
00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:09.840
I am happy to
to talk about myself,

375
00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.480
I have done there 7 hours.

376
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.240
In the environment of Sebastian Kurz

377
00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.000
and Red Bull billionaire
Dietrich Mateschitz

378
00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.040
one knew allegedly,
that there should be a trap.

379
00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.720
Who betrayed you,
Short, Mateschitz

380
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:25.640
or even the self-proclaimed
department store baron Rene Benko?

381
00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:27.320
I have no idea.

382
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:32.680
I am hearing this nonsense
for the first time.

383
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:34.840
No idea who is behind it?

384
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.800
We know today that the
journalists after years of

385
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.160
criminal operation of a group,
have been operating against me since 2014.

386
00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.720
That the 3 minutes of 7 hours
of a trap have published

387
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.160
and that for many years before that
several traps were built,

388
00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.600
to the point that they tried to
drugs, I had expenses...

389
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.600
Do you not take drugs?
Alcohol, unfortunately, does.

390
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:00.400
Yes? That's another addiction.
You're that kind of addict?

391
00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.880
One has one's addictions, yes, I too
have weaknesses, no question.

392
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.200
In the video, you said things
that maybe not all

393
00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.160
were criminally relevant, but
but morally they are still deeply disturbing:

394
00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.040
Takeover of the Kronen-Zeitung
by the oligarchs,

395
00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:17.080
Influencing the reporting
in favor of the FPÖ,

396
00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:19.440
Donations for the FPÖ
past the Court of Audit.

397
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.480
In return you promise
to the alleged Russian

398
00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:26.080
government construction contracts and
public water supply

399
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.960
and they want to privatize a channel
of the ORF to be privatized.

400
00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.320
That is wrong. What?
Every single point.

401
00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:34.240
Every single point was wrong!

402
00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:36.960
Let me guess,
it was other parties.

403
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:40.600
Every single point is wrong,
because the semantics and context

404
00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.320
was a completely different one.

405
00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:45.760
In the case of water, it was the protection
of the Austrian springs

406
00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:50.080
in the Austrian constitution
and precisely not the sell-out.

407
00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.520
This is documented in the
7 hours documented.

408
00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.120
But it shows the framing...

409
00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:58.640
They want us to watch
look at the 7 hours.

410
00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:01.280
Ingrid, why don't you call somewhere..,
and ask,

411
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:04.680
whether we can watch the 7 hours
at a stretch can look at now.

412
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.360
It shows the framing,
and that you cabaret

413
00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:09.360
the little brother
of Böhmermann.

414
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.640
Böhmermann's little brother.
Who is Mr. Böhmermann?

415
00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.800
Well, the state artist who
with you in the business.

416
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.280
There are so many things now.
With you it is like this:

417
00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:21.760
You have 100 times an old granny
down the stairs 100 times

418
00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.600
and then once but.

419
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.320
I have luckily
not pushed an old granny...

420
00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.080
Then what you do sucks
...On the contrary, I support them.

421
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.440
Shall I go through the points
go through them again,

422
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.240
that now stand for the grandma?

423
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:36.040
Gladly, but they are wrong.

424
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.560
The Kronen newspaper
wanted to buy this lady.

425
00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:41.040
I could not have sold
I could not have sold them at all.

426
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.920
You said in the video
that you can buy

427
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.440
and then there several
should kick out several people.

428
00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.400
No, I have
only said in the video,

429
00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.280
that for 15 years
in opposition politics

430
00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:58.000
one-sided reporting...
This is getting far too long.

431
00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:01.360
I would have liked to see neutral
reporting would have been desirable.

432
00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.160
Actually you have
just drunkenly pronounced that,

433
00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:11.160
what Kurz and his followers
then did.

434
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:14.000
Were you the pawn
of Sebastian Kurz?

435
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.560
I was certainly the target
of some over many years.

436
00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.200
Apparently I was in the way of some
and so I had to leave.

437
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:26.240
And I am glad that the assassination attempt
that I am alive today.

438
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.840
One did not have to look for much with you
search and just get that out.

439
00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:34.520
Today we know that in 2014 the group
sat together and discussed,

440
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.840
how I could be taken down.

441
00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:40.040
But if Kurz had
would have set a trap,

442
00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.200
you would tell us, wouldn't you?

443
00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:46.760
There was a discussion
between us in 2017,

444
00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.360
where he gave a hint
that I had a meeting

445
00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.080
between him and Silberstein
had uncovered on a plane,

446
00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:57.600
and he reacted to the fact that I
fly exclusively to Ibiza.

447
00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.160
At least that was
interesting in retrospect.

448
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.520
Right-wing populists always say that the
elites are lining their pockets,

449
00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.440
deceive the people, are corrupt.

450
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.240
That's exactly
what you have also done.

451
00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:14.360
I am certainly
not corrupt.

452
00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.680
Many preliminary proceedings were
started against me.

453
00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.400
After 3 years, 7 were hired.
It's always the same story.

454
00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:25.040
No, that is the reality,
7 Preliminary proceedings discontinued,

455
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.280
did not receive payment of costs,
charged twice.

456
00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.880
Shit happens all the time,
They want all foreigners

457
00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.120
leave the country, but you are
not a Nazi, not corrupt.

458
00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:38.240
Do they believe the bullshit
you're talking about?

459
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.240
Where are you going?
Aren't you politically dead?

460
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.120
They are so blinded, unfortunately,

461
00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.360
that you try to be funny in your left
way to be funny.

462
00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.360
But what should we
make of you?

463
00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.360
Everything that is not left-wing,
that is pathological for you.

464
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.600
I am not left at all.
At least you are sweating nervously.

465
00:24:54.760 --> 00:24:57.880
I've been sweating for 25 years.
Oh dear, that's bad. Yes.

466
00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.160
But how should we represent you?

467
00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.960
Simply human,
with all the flaws that everyone has.

468
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:06.720
But you have only mistakes.

469
00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:09.720
There comes the error
on two legs from Austria.

470
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.800
Fortunately, you are flawless.
So how do we get this right?

471
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.560
Fortunately, I also have strengths.
Which ones?

472
00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:18.480
So in Clash of Clans
you have legend status.

473
00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:21.760
We have done 1.5 years of
great government work,

474
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.800
had the greatest support.

475
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.240
When I look at green politics today
I understand the saying:

476
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:29.920
"Better a house in the green
than a green in the house."

477
00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.760
Was that a prepared gag?
Well, like yours.

478
00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.840
But why are you doing...
ah, politics you can

479
00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.360
do not continue,
because you were overthrown.

480
00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.040
Never say never.

481
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.000
So, "Sky" has filmed the whole thing
in a series.

482
00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:47.200
Sky is the real winner
of your fucked-up career, isn't it?

483
00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:51.440
Well... You have
received a Grimme Award.

484
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.800
At least during his lifetime
already been made a film.

485
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.320
Let's take a look.

486
00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.560
There is a reason
why we met.

487
00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:03.760
We are talking here about the
Austrian Vice Chancellor. Hi.

488
00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.360
People need to hear
what makes Strache tick.

489
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.000
The story needs to get out.

490
00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:10.440
That sucks!
It's about the big picture.

491
00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:14.200
Are you already
on a sequel?

492
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.520
No, this is a film
that has the claim,

493
00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.080
not to report on the election
and also set out in the lead,

494
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:26.080
that this is a film that is fictional.
that is fictional.

495
00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:27.840
Yes, four episodes.

496
00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.000
Not only your statement
for mobile games,

497
00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.560
but also many other
private costs you should then

498
00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:38.760
via the donation account of the FPÖ
have settled.

499
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.240
The Vienna public prosecutor's office
told us,

500
00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.680
that the investigations
are still ongoing.

501
00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.080
Shit that it
came out, right?

502
00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:48.760
It is not the case.

503
00:26:48.920 --> 00:26:50.560
I am reassured
and am glad

504
00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:53.320
on the reappraisal
of these false accusations.

505
00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.640
It's a shame it got out,
isn't it? That's how politics works.

506
00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.640
But you were too stupid
and let yourself get caught.

507
00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.240
I have always behaved
behaved correctly.

508
00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.080
My party has
decided to pay me the expenses.

509
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.880
Clash of Clans? Clash of Clans
has always been paid for privately.

510
00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:14.880
3000 Euro per month? Always
paid privately. Never from the party.

511
00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:22.640
Here's what you've accounted for:
Marriage to Philippa. Wrong.

512
00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.040
Children's birthday party. Untruth.

513
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:29.360
Opera ball, new office, dinner
as sports minister, cab bill,

514
00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.120
House in Klosterneuburg, vacation
in a luxury villa in Ibiza,

515
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.600
Medicines for 8000 euros.

516
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:41.040
The vacation is also a lie,
but that suits your level.

517
00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:42.640
This is all a lie?

518
00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:47.280
It all fits your level,
which I unfortunately also expected.

519
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.800
I am not the
the prosecution.

520
00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:54.120
Well you already convey
the humorous sex offender

521
00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:59.680
against everything that is not left-wing,
and cast aspersions around.

522
00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:05.240
I had a very nice
evening here with Jens Spahn.

523
00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:08.040
Probably this is
your personal friend,

524
00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.160
Yes, is my life partner. Exactly.

525
00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.440
But this comes from the
prosecutor's office, Mr. Strache.

526
00:28:13.600 --> 00:28:16.320
You act as if I were
that out of my nose.

527
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:19.600
Very briefly:
8000 euros for medication.

528
00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:22.440
Did you have
severe headaches?

529
00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.360
Including sexual enhancers.

530
00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:29.240
I got again and again for
medical reasons medication

531
00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:31.760
and have
partly paid privately.

532
00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.320
Did you have to mix them
with sexual enhancers?

533
00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.040
So I do not wish you
prostate cancer or other things.

534
00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.160
You are welcome to make fun of such
personal things.

535
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.040
I'm with the sexual enhancers.

536
00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:50.280
If you should have cancer,
I'm sorry, of course.

537
00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:53.040
This has nothing to do
to do with sexual enhancers.

538
00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:57.960
220,000 euros for the new office. At
we at the rbb are laughing our heads off.

539
00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.920
For what?
220.00 for office equipment.

540
00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:07.000
For which office, please?
That of the Federal Chancellor?

541
00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.800
Well yours or are you Samaritan?

542
00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.400
There is a vice chancellor's office
that was run down.

543
00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.560
This has been renovated, including the toilets.
Take a look at the clock.

544
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.200
We must now... You have been
expelled from the FPÖ

545
00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:24.840
and lost all
their political offices.

546
00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:29.160
At the end of 2019 you selflessly founded
the party Team H.C. Strache

547
00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:34.200
and failed in the Vienna
State Parliament and Municipal Council Election 2020

548
00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:36.040
at the 5% hurdle.

549
00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:40.560
Yes. Is there anything else coming from you?
In life, that's all part of it.

550
00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.720
Also the failure.

551
00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.560
But the important thing is that if you
fall down, also to get up again.

552
00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.920
Suggestion from me: Why don't you do
do something with Frauke Petry.

553
00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:53.200
I have no contact with her.

554
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:56.320
Only the viewers have to
google again,

555
00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:58.360
because it is completely forgotten.

556
00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.880
Yes, she has
retired from politics.

557
00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.560
So, 30 minutes.
Look at the clock. Wonderful.

558
00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:07.000
I am glad: The second Nazi,
who's out of the picture. Oh God.

559
00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:08.680
Have a nice rest of your life.

560
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.560
You are quite a
left-wing extremist. All the best.

561
00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.200
Pooh. Stay here quietly.
