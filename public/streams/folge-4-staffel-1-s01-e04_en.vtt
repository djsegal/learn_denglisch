Yes, unfortunately we have to leave here.
Duty is duty.

Yes, let's go!

A bit pathetic
for a red headquarters.

79

They all knew we were coming,
that we were coming.

80
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.200
Yes, of course.
The only question is where from?

81
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.720
(man) In Weserstrasse
they are already there!

They shoot? Just like that?

93
00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.200

that we are not Reds?

Get towels, quickly!

115

Take it easy. Breathe calmly.

116

128
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.360

And then in three weeks,
then see you

144

(Herrmann) Doctor!
It's good that you're here.

You've picked up
the right one.

154
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.440
Why?
What happened?

155
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.400
(quietly) Poor doctor. Communist Party member
with a seat on the Kreuzberg district council.

156
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.440
They shot them down
like sparrows.

157
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:23.800
The police?
Nobody saw that, comrade.

158
00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.120
We were there.
We almost went down with them.

159
00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:28.720
But you are not.

160
00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:32.800
We do not shoot
at innocent women.

161
00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:36.440
The blood is not yet dry
and you are already covering up.

162
00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:39.880
What are you doing here anyway?
as a vice cop?

163
00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:41.880
Are you a police officer?

164
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.160
Doris!

165
00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.800
Replenishment.

166
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.720
My fuffi, it's a mass.
You said it.

167
00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.400
We're sitting in a goldmine.
How long were you at it?

168
00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:04.800
Eleven hours this time.
That makes 8 markers 80.

169
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.320
You get it.

170
00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:07.520
And the Wilhelm vom Gräf.

171
00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.440
What?
The signature.

172
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.720
Oh well, I'll do it later.
Really. And the money.

173
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.960
Go home.
All the birds have flown.

174
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.520
There are no more orders today.

175
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.800
(Yes.
A minute taker for the murder.

176
00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:24.840
(all) Here!
- It's an autopsy, ladies.

*Lotte sighs.

178
00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.680
So who dares to do that?

179
00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:30.680
That's better than nothing.

180
00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:34.760
I'll do it.

181
00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:39.280
I'll pick it up later, okay?
Right.

182
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:47.760
This is my train, my goods,
that I have ordered and paid for.

183
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.320
If you do not release the goods
do not release the goods immediately,

184
00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.000
that has consequences,
You dilettante!

185
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:56.360
The Russians have given us hell ...

186
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:59.800
The train comes from the Russians!
They equipped it.

187
00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.880
Don't talk nonsense!

188
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.320
Wegener, what's going on?
- The Russians.

189
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:05.600
I told you.

190
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.200
What do they want?
- Check the load.

191
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.160
Pending clarification, there is apparently

192
00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:16.360
a legal claim of the Soviet Union
to the contents of the train.

193
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.120
How can that be?

194
00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.800
They suspect we were trying to
to smuggle something out of the country.

195
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.200
From Russia?
- We can certainly clarify that.

196
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.400
Why don't you let us
check the situation.

197
00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.240
I have to justify myself,

198
00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.880
because some run-of-the-mill
communists claim that?

199
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.120
Hello, Mr. Nyssen.

200
00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.880
People's Deputy Trochin,
Soviet Embassy.

201
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.200
How do you do?

202
00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:46.600
Do not misunderstand our intervention
wrong.

203
00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:50.000
We do not want to block the exchange of goods
not block the exchange of goods.

204
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.520
That is exactly what you are doing.

205
00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.000
There is apparently
a carriage on this train,

206
00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:59.200
which transports another load
transported - a single one.

207
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:01.760
What should be in there?

208
00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.880
I am not authorized,
to tell you that.

209
00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.120
This is currently
only a suspicion.

210
00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.120
That's why you're making
such a fuss?

211
00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.360
Yes.

212
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.400
Every day that the train stands here
costs me a fortune.

213
00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.320
If a suspicion
is not enough,

214
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:22.320
you can
the police.

215
00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:27.600
Which wagon are you talking about?
Just tell us the number.

216
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.840
To find out,
that's why I'm here.

217
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.720
Sign here.

218
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.000
That you get your things back.

219
00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:53.920
So which one is it?
- Nobody knows.

220
00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:58.000
The papers with
with the series identification are gone.

221
00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.440
Why?

222
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.440
When the train arrives,

223
00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:04.800
the train driver
ran off with the papers.

224
00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:06.400
Excuse me?

225
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:10.000
Is it not possible to identify the wagon
identified on the spot?

226
00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.520
How do you want to do that?
- We look into the boilers.

227
00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.240
They contain highly toxic pesticides.

228
00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:19.000
We cannot examine them here
investigate here.

229
00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.960
You will be able to open it somewhere
be able to open it.

230
00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.400
On our factory premises
in Zossen.

231
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.200
We also have a
engine shed for such purposes.

232
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.600
Take
the wagons there.

233
00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:34.800
Would you have the specialist staff?
- Sure, but not until Monday.

234
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.200
Good.

235
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.800
Organize this.

236
00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.600
And we will
be present at the investigation.

237
00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.240
*exciting music*

238
00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:09.960
*exciting music*

239
00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.720
*exciting music*

240
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.320
(in Viennese dialect)
So go, this is number 12.

241
00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:04.160
Number 13,
and it's just lunchtime!

242
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.880
It's like a tick.

243
00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.640
I'm allowed to attend the autopsy
be there.

244
00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.680
What on earth
is going on out there?

245
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.880
I can tell you that.
Let that be nice.

246
00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:16.920
Mrs. Stalina herself.

247
00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:20.320
In the name of so-called democracy
is being killed.

248
00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.560
Slander!

249
00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:24.800
The women were
shot by police officers.

250
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.680
You paint the enemy,
wherever you want.

251
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:30.760
Shoot first, ask questions later!
That's how it works here.

252
00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.400
They were not there,
but they all speak guilt-free,

253
00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.360
who openly break the law.

254
00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:38.800
What was the breach of law?

255
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.800
Agitators! Subversives!
Cover-ups! Murderers!

256
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400
Bruno!

257
00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.600
Enough now!
And up with them.

258
00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.400
Left corner.

259
00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.800
That's exactly where they belong.

260
00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.720
Jesus Christ once again!
Then just on the table in the center.

261
00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:55.560
Wait, wait, wait!

262
00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.560
I can't use them
I don't need them here.

263
00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.560
I won't leave them
alone with the victims.

264
00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.680
How are you supposed to work
with all the clamor?

265
00:18:04.920 --> 00:18:05.960
I'm staying!

266
00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.160
This is my dissecting room

267
00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:11.400
and I decide,
who decomposes here.

268
00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.640
Not you!

269
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.560
Well, well, the poor doctor.

270
00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.120
And the traffic police.
What are you doing here?

271
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:26.160
Lunch break.
It's so cozy here.

272
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.440
Why are you bringing a woman
to the autopsy?

273
00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.600
(Doctor) Please, is that necessary?

274
00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.760
All hands on deck.
Why do you have two dead bodies?

275
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.600
None of your business.

276
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.440
Why don't you go to the canteen
and order a meatball?

277
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.960
Taste something like this,
like it smells here.

278
00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.520
What does our
our canal float?

279
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:52.280
(Am I
the autopsy express?

280
00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.240
It's rush hour here today.

281
00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.680
But purely in terms of skull morphology
I would say:

282
00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:01.840
Looks Slavic,
maybe a Russian.

283
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:03.800
(Mhm.

284
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.200
*exciting music*

285
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.200
The man was Russian.

286
00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:17.400
In any case, he
spoke Russian.

287
00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.360
Ah. And who are you?

288
00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:23.480
Gereon Rath,
Special investigator from Cologne.

289
00:19:23.720 --> 00:19:27.880
What do you know about a Russian
body from the Landwehr Canal?

290
00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:30.560
He broke into
broke into my house yesterday.

291
00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.000
At Elisabeth's?
Did he steal something?

292
00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.120
(What was he doing there?

293
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:38.480
Something from the previous tenant,
a Mr. Kardakov.

294
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.200
When he wanted to escape,

295
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.320
he was pushed into a car
and threatened.

296
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.160
What make?
Possibly a Tatra.

297
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:49.760
Sounds a lot like
a Russian affair.

298
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.120
Maybe.

299
00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.160
The hands
didn't look like this yesterday.

300
00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:58.360
What happened there?
Crushing.

301
00:19:58.600 --> 00:19:59.600
Solid.

302
00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.520
Seems to have
has come under the wheels.

303
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.440
But that doesn't look
like an accident.

304
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:08.680
Sorry.

305
00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:09.920
So, the ...

306
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.520
You mean,
he was beaten up like that?

307
00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.400
Well, the injuries
work evenly, don't they?

308
00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.240
Did you learn to speak yesterday?
or what?! Get out of here!

309
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.920
What about the ...

310
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.760
This previous tenant,
what was his name?

311
00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:26.960
Out, I said!

312
00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.240
Kardakov.
I know nothing about him.

313
00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.640
My landlady
didn't know him well either.

314
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.680
But you confirm
that he's Russian?

315
00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.920
Yes.

316
00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:41.440
Good, for us the case is closed.

317
00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.440
The Bolsheviks
get your students.

318
00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:47.120
They can make
make meatballs out of it.

319
00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.760
But the man
may have been tortured.

320
00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.200
In Berlin, the Russians grumble at each other
each other.

321
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.960
Trotskyists, Leninists,
Stalinists, anarchists

322
00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.880
or even tsarists ...

323
00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:02.720
The more of them that are gone,
the better.

324
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:06.000
Autopsy report goes to you,
Chief Superintendent?

325
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.240
Stick it somewhere else.
- Have the honor.

326
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:14.200
If we set up a special commission for every dead Russian
we set up a special commission ...

327
00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:15.600
What is this?

328
00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:20.960
No idea, a four?

329
00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.800
*Bicycle bell

330
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.840
*exciting music*

331
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.960
An Overstolz tenner.
1,50.

332
00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:42.480
And I'll take a MoPo, too.
A morning mail.

333
00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:54.320
A two Havana Gold, please.
That's 1.50.

334
00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.360
Do you smoke cigars?

335
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.000
Oh.

336
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.360
Is for the boss.

337
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:01.680
Ah.

338
00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.720
You are not to be envied.

339
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:06.840
Oh ...

340
00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.840
It's not always like that.

341
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:14.120
He's actually a nice guy?
Nope, but sometimes less gruff.

342
00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:15.800
Hm.

343
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.560
Then he can also

344
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.920
the one or other murder
on the left.

345
00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.800
I don't like that either.

346
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:30.320
The man was afraid.

347
00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.160
He wasn't a tough guy.
I realized that too late.

348
00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.960
You want to keep at it.

349
00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.320
Hm, not so easy.
It's your department.

350
00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.400
Nobody asks any questions,

351
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.400
when a few inquiries
go over your desk.

352
00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.920
My boss does.

353
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.280
He doesn't need to know.

354
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.960
Cigarette?
Thank you.

355
00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.240
Oh.

356
00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:59.360
For better times.

357
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520
All right then.

358
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.640
What else does your landlady know
about this Kardakov?

359
00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.680
You've memorized the name.
I have two ears.

360
00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:13.400
So?

361
00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.960
Not much.
Supposedly he's on tour.

362
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.280
But he didn't take his suitcase
with him.

363
00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:21.120
Hm. Interesting.

364
00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:22.560
*Clock strikes

365
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.520
I have to.

366
00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.680
You will hear from me.

367
00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:28.400
Good.

368
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.920
And, uh, thanks again.

369
00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:34.400
About the other day.

370
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:18.160
*exciting music*

371
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:39.680
*calm, serious music

372
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.840
Can you watch for a moment?
- Yes, of course.

373
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.960
Don't you recognize me anymore?

374
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.400
Kinderlandverschickung '22.

375
00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.680
Greta!

376
00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:26.560
Greta Overbeck
from Gröningshusen on the Darß.

377
00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.920
What are you doing in Berlin?

378
00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.200
Oh ...

379
00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.120
I'm ... I'm just having lunch.
Are you hungry?

380
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.520
Me? No, thanks. I already have.

381
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.400
Come on, I'll invite you.

382
00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.640
I had only come here because of him
come here.

383
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880
I see.

384
00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:49.960
Suddenly Alfons
had disappeared from the face of the earth.

385
00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.440
I've somehow
heard before,

386
00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:53.880
the story.

387
00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.320
My parents
had warned me about this.

388
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:03.760
Through Alfons I had only
got to know an old gentleman.

389
00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:06.520
A writer,
I won't say who.

390
00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760
Oh, come on!

391
00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.240
Nope.
 Yes.

392
00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.160
Him?
 Yes.

393
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:18.800
*Lotte laughs in disbelief.

394
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.240
He helped me at first.

395
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:24.560
Then he asked if I wanted to
do the apartment for him.

396
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.280
So very gentle.
So ... fatherly tone.

397
00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:30.480
After two days
on the street again.

398
00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.360
And I'm still standing there.

399
00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:36.720
No one takes a maid
who is not recommended to him.

400
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.240
I wonder if you know anything.

401
00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:41.120
Maybe. Yes.

402
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.680
Well, at least you've
a bit of luck.

403
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.880
Charlotte Ritter - what was that like? -
Cri... Criminal assistant?

404
00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120
Correct.

405
00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.920
And if I make an effort,
I can become a commissioner.

406
00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.760
In the homicide department?

407
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.640
That makes six pennies.

408
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.800
Some of the guys are pretty funny
pretty funny,

409
00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.160
but my boss trusts me blindly.

410
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.880
(Thank you.

411
00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.240
And do you also see the ...

412
00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:15.800
So the ... the people who were killed?
The murder victims? Of course.

413
00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.520
I'm always
the first on the scene,

414
00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.280
together with the Chief Commissioner.

415
00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.400
Recently we had
one with a bad head.

416
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.160
What?
We found it later.

417
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.960
You wouldn't believe where.

418
00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.400
Where?

419
00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:37.120
*clatter*
Sorry.

420
00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.600
Oh, that's ...
That's already one.

421
00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.560
Um, I have to go.

422
00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:46.480
But do you fancy
go dancing later?

423
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:47.720
Good.

424
00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840
Good ...

425
00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.800
At Moka Efti, Friedrichstraße.
At nine.

426
00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:00.640
I'm glad you're here,
that you are here.

427
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.280
"Inspection A:
Murder and assault".

428
00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:17.520
*The phone rings.

429
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.960
(Homicide, good afternoon.

430
00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:26.880
Day.

431
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:31.320
(woman) That can make you
can be scary.

432
00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.720
What's up?

433
00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.640
I have a question.
 Oh.

434
00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:37.920
How do you actually become a
criminal assistant?

435
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.200
Do you have a school-leaving certificate?
Elementary school.

436
00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:44.720
Write an application.
Vicky, the Huber file!

437
00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.880
Just like that? To whom?

438
00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.720
Female police,
to whom else?

439
00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:52.280
Female police ...

440
00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.280
And what do they do?

441
00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:56.800
Survey and support

442
00:30:56.320 --> 00:31:00.400
sexual and moral offenses
of minors.

443
00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:02.400
I want to go to the murder.

444
00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.560
You want to go to the murder?
There are no women there.

445
00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.520
Except as a typist.

446
00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.240
Where can I find
these application documents?

447
00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:14.720
Personnel office.

448
00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.240
Thank you.

449
00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.880
Sh ...

450
00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:16.640
Yes, the Russians have met
often met here.

451
00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.800
"Red Fortress" is the name
his organization. Thank you.

452
00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.160
For the best socialism
of all times.

453
00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.720
Ardent Trotskyists, the troops.

454
00:32:25.960 --> 00:32:27.920
Does that mean anything to you?
 M-m.

455
00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.960
A communist breakaway
against Stalin.

456
00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:34.880
Want to free their country
from its yoke.

457
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:37.720
*He speaks Russian.

458
00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:41.800
Stalin is the gravedigger
of the revolution.

459
00:32:41.320 --> 00:32:42.840
Do you speak Russian?

460
00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.720
I am interested in
for the giants:

461
00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.640
Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy ...

462
00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.920
Whereby I am of the opinion,
Gulanin is completely underestimated.

463
00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.000
Through my room!
Thank God I wasn't there.

464
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.200
Yes, it was good that I was
at his mercy alone.

465
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.400
Mrs. Elisabeth,
that's not what I meant.

466
00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.760
No, you would have
You would have put him to flight immediately.

467
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.520
Exactly, with the stench
of my unventilated room.

468
00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.360
*silent laughter*

469
00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:19.880
Bloody May! Police! Blood May! Police!
- Don't touch the car.

470
00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.640
Bloody May! Police! Blood May! Police!

471
00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.760
Bloody May! Police! Blood May! Police!

472
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.000
(Charlotte, here!

473
00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.720
*floating dance music

474
00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.800
It's great, isn't it?

475
00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.320
Look at this.

476
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.680
*floating dance music

477
00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.240
Thank you.

478
00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.960
Well, go ahead.

479
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:36.400
Can you afford it?
 Nope.

480
00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.880
Your type is in demand.

481
00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:46.320
Where?

482
00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.280
Already there.
First section on the left.

483
00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.200
I'll explain later.
It won't take long.

484
00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.480
And you?

485
00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:01.360
Don't tell me you're a Virgo.
- No, I'm a Capricorn.

486
00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.640
Where is the widow?

487
00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.320
I'm the stand-in.
What do you want?

488
00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:14.000
I have someone for her.

489
00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:16.520
It will be back tomorrow morning.
Thank you.

490
00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.800
Well, what?

491
00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.680
Never seen a man in an armchair
seen?

492
00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.120
For chief commissioners
I am not available.

493
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:37.840
Don't worry.
I only dance standards.

494
00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:40.640
Forget it.
I'm not a hooker.

495
00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:44.160
You are not registered,
that is true.

496
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:49.320
What does that mean?

497
00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.840
That means
you get hold of §361.6 StGB.

498
00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:56.360
And then you know too,

499
00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.440
that you have to
have to register

500
00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.440
for the activity here.

501
00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:04.800
And with us.
With the custom.

502
00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:07.800
I'm only here by chance.

503
00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.400
Also a solution. Clever child.

504
00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.200
But you don't want to,

505
00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:15.480
that I let this place
blow up, right?

506
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:18.120
Then you're back
on the street

507
00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:20.280
and chat up the punters.

508
00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:23.320
But let's settle the matter
among ourselves.

509
00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:27.120
And right now.

510
00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.240
(Come on, let's dance.

511
00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:35.000
Come on, come on!

512
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:38.960
Nope.

513
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.520
Excuse me, miss?

514
00:36:53.760 --> 00:36:56.920
Your dress is fantastic!
Do you want to dance?

515
00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.640
Miss, do you have an escort?

516
00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.640
Was that it?

517
00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.680
Not quite yet.

518
00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.640
You and the snazzy guy from Cologne ...

519
00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.720
As I have seen,
you have already posed.

520
00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:27.280
For my taste, the gentleman is
a little too curious.

521
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.880
And what do I have to do with it?

522
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:33.680
Find out what he's looking for here.

523
00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.800
Why would I do that?

524
00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:40.320
Because otherwise all this
will end up on your criminal record.

525
00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.600
It's not clean anyway.

526
00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:47.880
But it has to be,

527
00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:50.760
if you want to stay with the police
want to stay.

528
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.600
Can you do something about that?

529
00:37:58.800 --> 00:37:59.880
You can take a look.

530
00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:19.800
I have here
a letter in Russian.

531
00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:21.560
Can you tell me
what it says?

532
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:29.800
I do not give
the most intimate news

533
00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:33.800
between Kardakov
and his lover.

534
00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:35.360
I'm almost afraid you have to.

535
00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:37.880
Why?
Because otherwise you'll arrest me?

536
00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.360
Exactly.

537
00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.400
All right then.

538
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.400
If you insist.

539
00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:47.280
Ready?

540
00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.880
"Darling, please get my dress
from the dry cleaners."

541
00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.320
"It kisses you S."

542
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.480
Svetlana Sorokina.

543
00:38:59.640 --> 00:39:00.840
Who is that?

544
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:04.120
Kardakov's mistress,
I said yes.

545
00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:05.520
He was often with her.

546
00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:09.280
You know, Mrs. Behnke
is strictly against ladies visiting.

547
00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:12.480
I am against your ladies visiting.
And family?

548
00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:16.960
Where are we going to get there?
There are hotels for that.

549
00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.760
*The phone rings.

550
00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:24.320
(next door) Behnke?
Just a moment.

551
00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:26.960
Mr. Rath?

552
00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:28.640
For you.

553
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.200
Presidium.

554
00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.920
Rath?

555
00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.600
It's me.

556
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.920
Who?

557
00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.920
Have you already done something
about your previous tenant?

558
00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:42.840
Is that why you are calling here?

559
00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:46.440
I take the opportunity
of a service apparatus.

560
00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:49.480
If there's something to do,
I have capacity.

561
00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.840
I actually have something for you.

562
00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:55.640
Kardakov's mistress
lives at Meraner Straße 7.

563
00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.680
Svetlana Sorokina.
Write this down.

564
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.400
Already happened.

565
00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:02.680
Then take a look
there tomorrow.

566
00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.560
Do you know the restaurant "Aschinger"?

567
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.520
Is the earth round?
Yes, of course.

568
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:12.400
We'll meet tomorrow at one o'clock.
Yes, fine.

569
00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.960
Listen again.

570
00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.160
I have an appointment with him.
Tomorrow, one o'clock, Aschinger.

571
00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:27.960
Good.

572
00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.480
Where do we meet?

573
00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:31.520
Well, here.

574
00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.600
*melancholic music

575
00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.320
*she sighs.

576
00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.720
Well, come on.

577
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.720
*dark music*

578
00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.640
At least 200 dead.

579
00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:51.480
(quietly) I don't think so,

580
00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.160
that Mr. Rath
has anything to do with it.

581
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.320
(Katelbach, quietly) Yes,
he was on duty in Kreuzberg.

582
00:41:01.240 --> 00:41:04.720
Well, what are we going to do
with the evening that has begun?

583
00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:09.400
*melancholic music

584
00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.400
Phew ...

585
00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.320
Do they belong together?

586
00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.640
Good.

587
00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:29.720
Here alone?
- Yes.

588
00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.600
No children?
- No.

589
00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:34.160
Then I'm sorry,
we are full.

590
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.200
Only women with children
tonight.

591
00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:08.400
*even breathing

592
00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.360
*She chooses.

593
00:42:26.520 --> 00:42:27.600
Hello?

594
00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:33.280
Connect me
with the Soviet Embassy.
