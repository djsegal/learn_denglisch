00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.680
* Music *

3
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.360
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.240
Philipp Amthor,
26 years old,

5
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.800
youngest member of the Bundestag
of the CDU.

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.280
His mentor: Angela Merkel.

7
00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.800
While others his age are smoking crack
smoking crack and flat-rate boozing,

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.160
he hangs around in the Bundestag.

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.520
Mr. Amthor?
Yes?

10
00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.280
Philipp actually, what?
You are still young.

11
00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.280
Yes ... You are the elder.

12
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.160
Then I'm actually offering the you?
Let's do it like this.

13
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.520
No, I didn't say that.
* Audience laughs. *

14
00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.160
Why, who offers it ...
Let me finish.

15
00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.120
I said I can offer the you.
But I won't. * (LAUGHING)

16
00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.160
And Philip, in terms of time...
* (LAUGHING)

17
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.160
Pretty late, huh?
Sandmann is already through.

18
00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.480
Wow, I bet before,

19
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.680
whether the first joke
is an age joke. Done.

20
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.520
I did not understand acoustically.
* Laughter *

21
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.560
That's always the case with good arguments.
I also do it that way.

22
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240
* Laughter *

23
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.000
Let's see, then.
* (clears throat)

24
00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.720
* Hum *

25
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.640
Get away from the door!
* (LAUGHING)

26
00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720
* Hum *

27
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.960
I forgot one.
* Laughter *

28
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.120
* Hum *

29
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.800
So, Philipp, there you are.

30
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.200
We leave the door open. With pleasure.
There's no danger from you.

31
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.320
* Laughter * Was not in any case
The aim of the program. So...

32
00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.160
Do you want something to drink?
With pleasure.

33
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.560
You're only 26 years old.
Yes.

34
00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.640
(laughs) You actually still have
still protected as a puppy, right?

35
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.960
It depends. Mostly not,
I don't need either.

36
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.000
What do you want to drink?
A glass of milk?

37
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.680
Rather not like that.
What do you have to offer?

38
00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.920
Look, something very fine.
Do you remember this?

39
00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.360
No, that's not... Come on.
We would have different colors.

40
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.040
You can also take this.
* (LAUGHING)

41
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.640
Or this.
These are for... You know?

42
00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.680
You can turn it up here.
I take such a water.

43
00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.160
Water is just out,
I have...

44
00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.520
Look, you want some coke?
It's a little late, isn't it? * (LAUGHING)

45
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.240
Parliament never ends early.
And with 26 ...

46
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.280
I don't know,
how it was with you?

47
00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.040
With you. * (LAUGHING)
Philip, with you.

48
00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.720
Look, we also have ... You are
the youngest guest of the squadron.

49
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.560
We were pleased
that we have young people.

50
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.400
Rbb now goes blatantly
on young people, huh?

51
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.640
Absolutely. We are
the epicenter of eternal youth.

52
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.880
We have a coloring book for you.
* Laughter *

53
00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.960
While I ask you questions,
you can choose a motif.

54
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.200
* (LAUGHING)
Yes?

55
00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.640
Look at this ...
Is Kurt KrÃ¶mer in it, too?

56
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.520
No. Do you want these?
Do you know? Cat.

57
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.480
Cat, yes.
How does the cat?

58
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.440
* Laughter *

59
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.600
It goes meow. Wow.

60
00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.280
Look,
here we still have some pens.

61
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.640
We can also play Mikado,
if you feel like it.

62
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
(laughs) Rather not. I thought you
you were going to do substantive talk. Yes?

63
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.680
Look, look first.
That's the mouse. * (LAUGHING)

64
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.320
It starts with an M.

65
00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.160
We still have cookies for you.

66
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.600
We thought we were going to animals.
Look.

67
00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.400
That's the owl.
* (LAUGHING)

68
00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:10.920
So.

69
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.640
Now drink so it doesn't get warm.
* Laughter *

70
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.560
* rustle *

71
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.800
Are you already
ready for the first question?

72
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.440
Yes, the half-life of the
age jokes is also used up.

73
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.160
Is already?

74
00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.920
Do you know another one,
you'd like to do? * Laughter *

75
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.640
I do not know, you collect
many over time. But come on.

76
00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.240
Since 2017
you have been a member of the Bundestag.

77
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.840
You first lived in Berlin-Kreuzberg,
now in Mitte.

78
00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.120
As a matter of fact, yes. How does someone like
someone like you end up in Kreuzberg?

79
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.400
That was funny. I didn't know that until
when I registered the apartment.

80
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.000
I lived at Potsdamer Platz ...
Moment.

81
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.160
You have registered an apartment
and only then rented?

82
00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.160
No. I did not know
which district it is.

83
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.160
At Potsdamer Platz
is where Kreuzberg begins.

84
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.440
Who would think that I would
move to Kreuzberg? No one.

85
00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.760
See? (laughs) None.
I got through that, too.

86
00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.920
Turkish hand water?
* Laughter *

87
00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.960
I didn't have any experience with that in my
I had no experience with that in my Kreuzberg days.

88
00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.040
Great.
Rub it in your hands nicely.

89
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.480
Does that make you
a great guy like you?

90
00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.640
I don't know ...
I don't do it, for example.

91
00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.600
* Laughter *

92
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.360
People's hands have already
hands have fallen off.

93
00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.440
Well, we're looking.
Good.

94
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.680
You just randomly
moved to Kreuzberg?

95
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.520
Look, all for you.
Super.

96
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.080
No, with the entry into the
Bundestag, something had to be done quickly.

97
00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.760
That was logistically close.

98
00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.840
Potsdamer Platz,
6,000 euros a month: no problem.

99
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.760
It was not like that. No?

100
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.800
Was it possible to drive the Porsche
into the living room?

101
00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.960
I don't know your needs.
I have none.

102
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:13.560
I don't even have a driver's license.
That would be bad in Western Pomerania.

103
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.720
We'll get to Western Pomerania later.
It's also exciting.

104
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.600
Did you run around in Kreuzberg
like now or with Gucci joggers?

105
00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.840
I have not spent that much time
spent in Kreuzberg.

106
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.360
It was rather the joke,
that Kreuzberg starts there.

107
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.960
You can imagine,
that this is not quite my neighborhood.

108
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:39.240
Yes? Yes.
* (LAUGHING)

109
00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.640
Do you still have to register yourself?

110
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.680
Draws Philipp Amthor
a card at the registration office

111
00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.600
and waits eight hours?

112
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:51.240
It worked out with an appointment.
You have to go in person?

113
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:55.920
Of course, one is not a
a first- or second-class citizen.

114
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.800
Of course, I do the same.
Too bad, isn't it? Oh, no problem.

115
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.840
Yes? Good.

116
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:06.920
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
you just said.

117
00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.400
Did you also
with old people?

118
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.840
Also with young.

119
00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.120
When you were 16, you went on
on an election campaign tour.

120
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:18.720
Did she have mommy feelings
towards you? You have to ask her.

121
00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.000
Did she spit in the handkerchief
and went to your mouth?

122
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.280
That did not happen. No?

123
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.040
Did she not show maternal
feelings because she thought,

124
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.840
she has to take the little fucker
in the arm?

125
00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.440
She did not have that impression.
Many young people supported her.

126
00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.480
Oh, you supported her?
We campaigned for them.

127
00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.720
Was it any good? Obviously.
She is still chancellor.

128
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.600
Because of your help, or what? The
maybe not, but together.

129
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.000
Yeah yeah, sure.
Did you hand out balloons?

130
00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.960
No, we convinced voters.
It worked, even for me.

131
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:59.760
Did you have a poster of
of Merkel above your bed? No.

132
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.240
Wasn't that ...
No, it didn't go that deep.

133
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.640
You knew relatively early on
that you were going to join the CDU, didn't you? Yes.

134
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.880
Angela Merkel is the first
chancellor you have witnessed.

135
00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:15.320
Indeed.
It's a bit sad too, isn't it?

136
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.800
I don't think it's so sad.
It makes me sad.

137
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.120
I think,
you can't get any closer.

138
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:27.560
She is my constituency neighbor
and has a good impression of it,

139
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.560
how it went at home
and was always present.

140
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:34.200
Was she also at home with you?
In Western Pomerania, where I grew up.

141
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.120
She was at your house in private?
Of course not.

142
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.760
No.
They don't do that.

143
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.520
There is also
no reason to do so.

144
00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:45.000
What does she get out of it,
visiting children in Western Pomerania?

145
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:49.040
But she has often been with us
in Western Pomerania and that was good.

146
00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.360
Did you ever skip school
ditch school for Angie?

147
00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.560
* Laughter *

148
00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.320
I used to say in the
Fridays-for-future debate:

149
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:02.320
When I was on the state student council,
I was absent once.

150
00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.440
There were also ...
* Laughter *

151
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.320
Impressive, impressive.

152
00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:13.560
There were good reasons for it,
but I didn't do it every Friday.

153
00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.160
You were class president,
state student representative,

154
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:26.160
have a 1.4 A-levels
and studied law. Yes.

155
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.080
1,4 ... In Western Pomerania
is assessed differently, isn't it?

156
00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.760
* (LAUGHING)
No, it's the same.

157
00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.080
In Berlin this is
an extended secondary school leaving certificate.

158
00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.880
I don't think that Berlin
schools are good for anything.

159
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:41.920
No? Oh.

160
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:45.640
These are rather times when
lost in Berlin around the Abitur level.

161
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:51.080
Was that a diss against Berlin?
You politicians have to be careful.

162
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:55.040
I don't govern there,
but Red-Red-Green. I see.

163
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:58.200
You open in Vorpommern
you open your mouth against Berlin

164
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.520
and then you think,
all Berliners vote for the CDU?

165
00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.720
No, but in Berlin
there are enough problems.

166
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.360
Berlin schools ... Ailing, aren't they?
Not everything is in order there.

167
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.880
Exactly. And what have you done about
ailing Berlin schools?

168
00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.720
I am not a
Berlin state politician. I see.

169
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:20.880
I take care of my constituency
and federal politics.

170
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.080
Are in Western Pomerania
all schools made of ivory? No.

171
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.280
But we have
also for the Berlin state policy

172
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:31.720
a lot has been done in the federal budget,
DigitalPakt Schule and Co.

173
00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.760
Say two more things,
so that we have three.

174
00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:39.360
School policy
is mainly a matter for the states.

175
00:10:39.520 --> 00:10:42.480
We have relieved the
a great deal of financial relief.

176
00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.000
You could do a lot, but Berlin
has other dream dances

177
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.800
and more important things to do.

178
00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.080
What is the most important thing in Berlin?

179
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:55.840
There was the discussion
about Women's Day as a new holiday.

180
00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.560
Then there is ... You are
against Berliners and against women?

181
00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.840
* Laughing *
Walking none of the above.

182
00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.200
Or only against Berlin women?
No, not that either.

183
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:11.760
But the emphasis in
state policy is not mine.

184
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.600
Yes, I notice that too.

185
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:18.440
We look at photos of it,
how you live, feel, think. Na.

186
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.040
* Laughter *

187
00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.400
But not so bad
in Western Pomerania, is it?

188
00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.800
Did that cost money?
* (LAUGHING)

189
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:31.280
That was the contest
for the selection of the Amber Princess

190
00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.880
in Koserow on Usedom.

191
00:11:34.040 --> 00:11:38.640
Oh, that's nice.
A member of parliament who is close to home.

192
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.360
Right was in the election campaign,

193
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:43.320
a cooking competition
of the candidates for the Bundestag.

194
00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:47.520
What's the name of what you're peeling?
A potato. Potato, good!

195
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.120
I even won.
A potato peeling contest?

196
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:56.640
No, a cooking competition
of the candidates for the Bundestag. Nice.

197
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.760
Oh, what's that?
Are you here at the carnival? No.

198
00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.400
I am also a hunter. Oh, this is
a shotgun! Shotgun?

199
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.120
Shotgun and clay pigeon shooting.
Do you have a license for that? Sure.

200
00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:13.800
A hunting license
is not so easy to make ...

201
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.840
Anyone can do that,
but you should also do a little ...

202
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.920
You have a hunting license? Yes.
* (LAUGHING)

203
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.320
Can you say: "I am Philipp
Amthor and have a hunting license"?

204
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:33.080
This is also a sign of
"not sane".

205
00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:36.520
Is that so?
Yes, have a hunting license? Here ...

206
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.840
(laughs) Well ...
In Berlin slang or what?

207
00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.920
You lived in Kreuzberg

208
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:46.760
and from the window with the
Shotgun shot at pigeons?

209
00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.600
No, none of that.
On women and schools?

210
00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:51.480
Oh, for God's sake.

211
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.720
No, this is
for pure hunting use.

212
00:12:55.880 --> 00:13:01.160
And it is important
to practice this on the shooting range.

213
00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.160
A shooting match is often made fun of
often made fun of from a Berlin perspective.

214
00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.880
But that is what makes a deputy
from the country, too.

215
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.160
Mhm.
People are close to home.

216
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.080
The reality of our lives is
clearly different from Berlin-Kreuzberg.

217
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.080
So ... Let's talk
talk about the AfD.

218
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:24.440
The AfD has swept the elections in
Brandenburg and Saxony.

219
00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.120
Why don't you form a coalition with them?

220
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:29.880
With the AfD ...
Fits you perfectly.

221
00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.840
No, I don't think so at all.

222
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.120
They like guns, think gay marriage
and burkas stupid ... Running.

223
00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.760
Burka is a good keyword.

224
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.360
My speeches
in the German Bundestag show,

225
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:45.360
how I deal
deal with the AfD.

226
00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.000
Why don't you say: VTR off.

227
00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.160
VTR off.

228
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:54.760
You act,
as if we were the lawbreakers?

229
00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:59.160
The report of the
Scientific Service states,

230
00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.720
that your draft
is unconstitutional.

231
00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.560
Complete nonsense,
to argue like this.

232
00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:06.400
Do your job right

233
00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:09.240
and listen to me,
you can still learn something.

234
00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:12.320
The following example
you may understand:

235
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.080
The freedom of deputies from
Article 38 does not force you either,

236
00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.000
submit correct applications.
You are allowed to submit such nonsense.

237
00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.680
Finally, one:

238
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.600
You want to be the saviors
of the Christian West?

239
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:29.880
They are neither that
nor a party of the rule of law.

240
00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:34.320
Do your job, then
we'll discuss it in the Interior Committee.

241
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.720
That's some steam you've let off!

242
00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.200
And at least
drank three cokes beforehand.

243
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.560
No, not even one of those.
Out of control.

244
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:49.520
But this shows that there is a
and reality at the AfD.

245
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.840
It is often really weak from a technical point of view,
what they deliver.

246
00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.280
I think it is right
not to talk about a coalition.

247
00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.120
They do not
from right-wing extremism.

248
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:05.160
This is not a basis
to work with each other.

249
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:10.400
You have to deal with it on an argumentative
level. Exactly, there.

250
00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:12.680
The TV,
starts with F.

251
00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.560
But burqa ban
you find cool, right?

252
00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.520
Well, you have to
see the legal boundaries.

253
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:21.000
There are hardly any people in Germany,

254
00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:26.040
who would find a burqa on German streets
would find normal. Therefore ...

255
00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:29.880
I was also born in NeukÃ¶lln,
grew up in Kreuzberg,

256
00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:33.080
have lived in Wedding and not ...

257
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.520
Nothing burst inside me.

258
00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.200
I would say ...
Am I the only one who sees it that way?

259
00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:41.840
No. Lucky shot?

260
00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.520
No, if it is self-determined,
you can do all that.

261
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:47.520
But in many places ...

262
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.120
If you look at Berlin,
with parallel societies...

263
00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.680
Generations of immigrant families
do not speak German,

264
00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.000
Children have fewer opportunities.
I don't think that's good.

265
00:15:59.160 --> 00:16:02.240
"Constitutional concerns
on Gay Marriage."

266
00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.200
Are you more of a homophobe
or a lawyer? Ah ...

267
00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:09.200
No one likes to hear it,
but the CDU has

268
00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:14.920
for the Civil Partnership Act
and equality.

269
00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:20.520
And in the end you also have to say ...
In the end, people always get married.

270
00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.360
You can argue about it,
what marriage is ...

271
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.440
But they are not allowed to marry
according to your opinion not.

272
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:30.160
We have
made a legal regulation.

273
00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.880
The uses the term marriage.

274
00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.400
One can argue about it,
what the constitution sees there.

275
00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.480
I think that has nothing to do
to do with homophobia.

276
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.520
Frederick the Great said that everyone should
be happy according to his own facon.

277
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:46.520
Then let them get married.

278
00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:50.040
Yes, we have
made a legal arrangement.

279
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.640
But I consider this bill
in the way

280
00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:57.360
for constitutionally
not reasonable.

281
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:02.960
Constitutional? When
two men or women love each other?

282
00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:08.440
You can be so emotionally charged.
I would say that in a marriage.

283
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.560
But the law
is about the question,

284
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.040
whether a two-thirds majority
two-thirds majority would have been needed.

285
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.680
In my opinion, yes.
There you are out.

286
00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.880
But it is a formal question,
how to act.

287
00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:25.480
I didn't like the way it was done so
before the federal election was not great,

288
00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:29.720
but this does not mean that
the Christian West will perish.

289
00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.360
It is better after all,

290
00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.720
when people take
take responsibility for each other.

291
00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.360
Exactly, if they also marry, for example.
After all, we have the regulation ...

292
00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:43.280
I write "anti-gay."
No, I do not think so.

293
00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.880
* (LAUGHING)
Anti-gay.

294
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.960
Fortunately, you and I
don't have any problems, do we?

295
00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:53.360
There are already problems
that I like to tackle.

296
00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:55.760
If I were to buy you
buy something from Gucci,

297
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.280
would you marry me?
No.

298
00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:02.520
(LAUGHS) Anti-gay.
* (LAUGHING)

299
00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.480
Touche.
Okay, that was good.

300
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.720
Would you shoot refugees?
Or if, only in need?

301
00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.000
What kind of wording is that?
We have always said ...

302
00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:16.400
You're already prepared, aren't you?

303
00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.360
You get asked a question like that
30 times every day

304
00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.000
and you fetch the answer
the answer from the drawer.

305
00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:29.120
No, that is Beatrix von Storch's
absurd wording. Ask her that.

306
00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:34.920
Unfortunately, she canceled.
We were all very sad.

307
00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.120
When I look at it that way ...
Calm down! Or eat an owl.

308
00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.080
* Laughter *

309
00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.520
You don't have a thing for foreigners,
do you? Why?

310
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.840
We have a VTR.
# This happiness

311
00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.680
With so much black-red-gold

312
00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.240
Amthor's national feelings
boil over a bit.

313
00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.840
This is followed by a rude remark
against ex-national player Mesut Ãzil.

314
00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.520
(laughs) None of us are Muslims,
who can't sing that.

315
00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.480
(man) No oil eye.
* (LAUGHING)

316
00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.360
* Astonishment and laughter *

317
00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.800
Didn't you want to sing
sing the first verse?

318
00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.160
Oh, no one sings them at the CDU.

319
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:26.000
You the scene I spoke out.
That was anything but correct.

320
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.640
It was an emotionally
charged situation.

321
00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:33.680
At the time, there was a debate about whether Mesut
Ãzil sing along with the national anthem.

322
00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:38.280
And how it is
with Jogi and his boys ...

323
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.440
Some of us get carried away
sometimes get carried away.

324
00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:46.000
Was that the right way to handle,
the right wording? No.

325
00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:50.800
Absolutely not, but ...
One got carried away. Yes.

326
00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:55.560
Yes. Then one says oil eye
and one laughs too.

327
00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.480
We can argue about that for a long time.
We can do that. We have time.

328
00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.680
Do you stand up in the situation
and say, "That's not possible at all"?

329
00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.320
Exactly. You can do that.
That would be a start.

330
00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:11.760
Was this scene optimal? No.

331
00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:16.360
I have also said to this,
that it is not right,

332
00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.920
to talk like this
and making sweeping statements.

333
00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:21.840
In our national team
are enough Muslims,

334
00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.280
singing along with the national anthem.

335
00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:29.200
I am self-critical
and in this Ãzil debate

336
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.840
emotionally not
the best figure.

337
00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:36.720
A beautiful statement. For that
you can have a cookie.

338
00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:38.600
Philippchen.

339
00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.640
In your constituency
the AfD was particularly strong,

340
00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:43.480
but you were the winner.

341
00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.960
Do they vote for you,
because you are AfD light?

342
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:51.080
No, not at all. Because I deal
deal with the people.

343
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:54.840
But you already fish
a little bit.

344
00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.440
I have worked with my team
before the federal election

345
00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.400
knocked on 15,000 front doors
and asked ...

346
00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:04.800
15.000?
15,000, with the team.

347
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.960
Did everyone say, "Hooray,
Philip is here!"? Exactly not.

348
00:21:08.120 --> 00:21:11.520
Many were skeptical and I spoke to
people about the AfD.

349
00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.320
In 2016, they had
strong results in the state elections.

350
00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:19.760
I said, "What do you want with them?
They won't solve your problems.

351
00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.400
Many said:

352
00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.440
"We know that, but vote for them,
because we are disappointed in you."

353
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.320
It is then up to us
to understand this.

354
00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.800
Structural change, other issues ...

355
00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:35.080
There people do not ask first

356
00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:38.400
after vegan diet
in the canteen.

357
00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.680
There they first ask
about the infrastructure on site

358
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.040
or medical care.

359
00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.720
Now you get one with chocolate.
* (LAUGHING)

360
00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.560
There is potential for improvement here.

361
00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:01.160
So, now we come to the Rezo video.
15 million, the destruction of the CDU.

362
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.120
You should answer.
Is anything else coming?

363
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.880
* (LAUGHING)
It's still in the cut, isn't it?

364
00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:12.120
There are still filters
and hearts are put over it. So ...

365
00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:16.240
The Rezo debate ...
You certainly weren't allowed to.

366
00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:19.800
It wasn't that you didn't want to,
that you didn't want to.

367
00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:25.960
The Rezo debate certainly belongs ...
15 million

368
00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.720
15 million have clicked on it.

369
00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.000
This is not one of the
of the great moments ... From you?

370
00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:34.400
I personally
have nothing to reproach myself for.

371
00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.720
I was asked to make a video
and have made it.

372
00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.320
In the end, it was a decision
to do it just so.

373
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:45.720
In terms of communication, the CDU
did not look good in these weeks.

374
00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.560
This is clear to all involved
and we are discussing it intensively,

375
00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.680
what conclusions one draws.

376
00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:56.000
One thing is clear:
The CDU has taken the brunt of it,

377
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.480
but all parties were hit.

378
00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:02.600
We do not have
the right answer.

379
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.080
In view of the last
election results, it is important,

380
00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.880
not to lose a whole generation
to lose.

381
00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.560
We must become better
in political communication.

382
00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.120
Those from the CDU
thought your video was so good,

383
00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:18.280
that they said
the one from CSU should do it?

384
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:21.040
That is not
the answer to Rezo.

385
00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.400
That's what the CSU did for itself.

386
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:25.320
Welcome to CSYou,

387
00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:29.320
the social media show of the CDU
in the Bundestag. I am Armin.

388
00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:32.040
To all the policy whiners out there,

389
00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.920
who complain that the GroKo
is getting nothing done in Berlin.

390
00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:40.920
The opposite is the case:
The GroKo is better than its reputation.

391
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.280
When once again
someone in your environment

392
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.600
the big grumbling
about Berlin politics,

393
00:23:47.760 --> 00:23:50.800
just send him
a link to this video.

394
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:52.960
Hello!
* Music *

395
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.200
Well, there you go!
Was nevertheless rousing.

396
00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.120
You immediately think about
to move and vote for CSU.

397
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:06.440
The video had dislikes: 18...
No, 100, 1,000...

398
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.880
No, 18...
No, 183,000 dislikes.

399
00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:14.280
That is,
where the thumb goes down.

400
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.920
And thumbs up: 4,400.
* Laughter *

401
00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.560
You could have done better.

402
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:24.480
What would you
say to this 183,000 to 4,400?

403
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.960
Certain politicians
then respond with "Fifty-fifty."

404
00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:33.840
That the criticism on this video
is not outstandingly good, is so.

405
00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.520
You see that yourself, don't you?
That's what the numbers show.

406
00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.160
I don't wipe those away,

407
00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:43.640
but don't find it as bad
as in this shitstorm.

408
00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:46.240
I distance myself.

409
00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:48.560
I don't think it's that bad.

410
00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:53.800
One can argue about it,
how authentic this is ... Zero.

411
00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:55.440
* Laughter *

412
00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.160
Either he had to
shoot a thousand times,

413
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.200
because someone always said:
"No, go like this."

414
00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:05.320
Or the man has
a massive alcohol problem.

415
00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:10.080
* I don't know him.
Is he actually human?

416
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:11.920
Or a robot?

417
00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.840
I think the idea is not bad.
The idea was bad.

418
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.120
No, I don't think it's bad.
But the implementation was bad.

419
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.000
Fresher formats. Yes.

420
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:26.080
It is clear to all involved that this is
not yet the end of the puzzle.

421
00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:28.560
Of course, you still adjust something,

422
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.360
but I also think it's brave
to get involved in it.

423
00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:36.520
Bold, but no effect.

424
00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:40.600
That it was not celebrated by the
is true that it was not celebrated by the network community.

425
00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:46.280
Too bad, huh? But it's a phase,
where you try out what works.

426
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:50.280
From the criticism for this video
one learns also with the CSU.

427
00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:53.520
Very good. But the idea
I think is good for now.

428
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.320
And what was said ...

429
00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:59.200
Young people, raisins in the head.
You can do that sometime.

430
00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:02.400
But your video
has been cashed in.

431
00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:04.840
Then calls in the evening
Mrs. Merkel calls you in the evening,

432
00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.560
you are
in Justin Bieber pajamas ...

433
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.560
I don't have one of those.
She says, "Philip, what are you doing?"

434
00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:15.120
No ... Who told you:
"You can't"?

435
00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:18.840
We have decided that
decided collectively. Who?

436
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.160
So ... Did Mrs. Merkel...
Does she actually call you?

437
00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:27.160
Or does she say: "I used to stay with him in
in Western Pomerania at home."

438
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.560
She has not
not involved in the Rezo video.

439
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.720
The bottom line was the question:
What is it for the CDU?

440
00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:38.400
Does that prolong the debate,
to bring the answer video?

441
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.360
I said mine about it.

442
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.120
That was communicatively
not the best performance,

443
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:49.200
but I also wondered how
everyone is waiting for a video from me.

444
00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.640
Why did you not rebel

445
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.920
and enforced,
that the video is shown?

446
00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:57.240
Who was
the fear monger in the background?

447
00:26:57.400 --> 00:27:00.800
That was a joint decision and
decision and that's okay.

448
00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.880
There are more important things
for Germany and the debate

449
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:09.360
than the question if and when a video
of mine will be published.

450
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:15.720
And it is a video of the CDU,
to which I was asked.

451
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:20.360
Afterwards, it was decided collectively
decided not to do it.

452
00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:23.560
But that was not
the downfall of the whole.

453
00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:26.880
Are you already looking forward
about puberty? * (LAUGHING)

454
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:30.320
I've been through it,
Didn't do me any harm. Yes? Good.

455
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:32.760
So, Philipp.
That's it.

456
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:36.200
Honestly? You could have
You could have kept talking, huh?

457
00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.480
You too, right?
Did you say you? Yes. * (LAUGHING)

458
00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:43.200
Did I give you permission to do that?
I am Mr. KrÃ¶mer.

459
00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:48.440
If one duzt,
you do it the same way.

460
00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.560
But not with me.
All right.

461
00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:53.440
We go out.

462
00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.720
Because you participated so beautifully:
a bar of chocolate.

463
00:27:59.880 --> 00:28:03.040
You can eat them all by yourself.
Take them quietly with you.

464
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:05.720
You can distribute them in the audience.

465
00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.480
* Applause *

466
00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.280
So.

467
00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:18.560
We're wrapping up now,
where you speak into camera four.

468
00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:20.920
What have you achieved so far?

469
00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.400
So, I have ...
Not too long. Yes.

470
00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:28.720
Short and to the point,
perhaps in one sentence.

471
00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.640
One sentence? Come on.

472
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.040
You have four seconds left.

473
00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.240
I have ...
Can become long.

474
00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.440
I have
a good show behind me.

475
00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.400
Mr. KrÃ¶mer has made an effort.

476
00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.640
A few age jokes came,
but otherwise it was funny.

477
00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.880
Otherwise, it was fun,
I thought so too.

478
00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:51.080
Take the chocolate with you.
As I said, to the audience.

479
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.120
There are ten euros on it.

480
00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:56.080
The beautiful fee money!
Can't be.

481
00:28:56.240 --> 00:28:58.680
Is private money.
Even worse.

482
00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.000
Do you need a receipt?
No, no.

483
00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:05.840
Would you be thrown out of office
if you took the ten euros

484
00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.160
and not take a receipt for it?

485
00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.720
Of course, I would have to
as a donation from a member of parliament.

486
00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.520
But such things
I do not do as a matter of principle.

487
00:29:16.680 --> 00:29:20.360
You don't? No.
Not in the CDU, huh? No. Yes.

488
00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.920
The only ones...
* Laughter *

489
00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.640
Only the AfD has problems with that.
Take care, neighbors.

490
00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.280
* Applause *

491
00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.120
* Music *
