00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.160
(Ch. Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.400
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.240
# You are my love
very, very, veritable

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.680
* (clears throat)

6
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.880
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.360
Prof. Dr. Günther Krause,
CDU, 67 years old.

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.120
Signed on behalf of the GDR the
German-German Unification Treaty,

9
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.440
was then Federal Minister of Transport.

10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.960
He was the first politician
to enter the jungle camp.

11
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.000
Mr. Krause?

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.440
Are you talking about me?
Is there another Krause sitting here somewhere?

13
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.080
There are many ruffs.

14
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.960
Ready for the party, Mr. Krause?
But of course.

15
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.160
No party without Krause.
Uh, yes.

16
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.720
Are there any other gags with Krause,
then we'll put that away now.

17
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.800
God saw with "ruffs
into the depths. - Please?

18
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.120
And wondered ...
First the question, then the answer.

19
00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.400
God saw with "ruffs
into the depths.

20
00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.640
What? - It's in the Bible,
but they don't know it.

21
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.320
I know it by heart, Mr. Krause.

22
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.840
If you believe it, you will be happy.

23
00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.400
* audible exhalation *

24
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.640
I am pleased, Mr. Krause.

25
00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.120
Me especially.

26
00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.200
On the table
I leave them lying ...

27
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.880
So. - Hello.

28
00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.480
Here we are. The "Krause" file.
I have a gift for you.

29
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.720
Please?
I have a gift for you.

30
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.600
Advertising?!
There's none here.

31
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.200
So that they can read
what happens next.

32
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.440
Pleased to meet you.
Mr. Krause. - Yes. - Soda?

33
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.160
No, no fizzy drinks.
Do you want a drink?

34
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.600
From a North Star refrigerator
I would take something,

35
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:04.040
but not Bauknecht.
Today, they are fixated on advertising.

36
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.960
Nordstern was from the GDR.

37
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.760
You are fixated on advertising,
can that be?

38
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.360
Me, on advertising? I have to
to advertise your show.

39
00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.760
Here you go.

40
00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.840
So, Mr. Krause.

41
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.280
The "Günther Krause" file.
File.

42
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:28.440
* (clears throat)

43
00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.480
They laid in 1990,

44
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.120
without having made much of a career
career before that,

45
00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.600
a really big Otto.
We'll take a look at him.

46
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.000
At 1:42 p.m., the time had come:

47
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.200
Both negotiators,

48
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.520
Minister of the Interior Schäuble
for the FRG

49
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.920
and State Secretary Krause for the
GDR, signed the contract,

50
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.840
through the 48 articles
on about 2000 pages

51
00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.560
the growing together of the two
German states is regulated.

52
00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.560
Now the 30th anniversary was
was celebrated in Potsdam.

53
00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.480
Fat Otto is,
You were not invited.

54
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.160
That is typical for East Germans,
that you don't need them then.

55
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.280
Officially due to
Corona participation restriction

56
00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.680
and because many female citizens
should be invited.

57
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.240
Why should I be
be different from others.

58
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.320
Shared with me through the newspaper

59
00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.080
the press spokeswoman
of the Prime Minister with,

60
00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.040
invited are citizens
and officials.

61
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.560
I'm not one of them.
They co-signed the thing.

62
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.080
Ask Mr. Woidke,
he was responsible. - Who?

63
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.480
(louder) The
Minister President Dr. Woidke.

64
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.120
Not me.

65
00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.000
I am not hard of hearing, I just
just did not understand you acoustically.

66
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.880
That's why I repeated it.

67
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.520
So Schäuble was there.

68
00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.080
Germany one, GDR zero.

69
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.440
Schäuble is a functionary.

70
00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.960
It's as if Dick and
and Doof get the Lifetime Achievement Award

71
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.800
and Doof can only go there.

72
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.920
I don't know if Doof goes there,
it was a choice.

73
00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.920
29 years I was invited,
in the 30th year not.

74
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.160
Why not?
I do not know.

75
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.480
Do you think at home: I don't care
I don't care, I don't give a damn,

76
00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.480
then just not?
Aren't you angry too?

77
00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.800
I pointed this out often enough,

78
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.640
that only about 60% of the Unification
treaty was implemented in this way,

79
00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.840
how the contract was made.

80
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.160
Mostly at the expense of the East Germans.

81
00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:44.080
Do I hear that they have been
in the last 30 years?

82
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.680
I didn't miss out at all.
I am doing well.

83
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.720
However, many
many East Germans are not doing so well.

84
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.080
Look at how many East Germans
are in management positions.

85
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.600
We have
a German Chancellor, okay.

86
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.440
She was born in Hamburg
and then brought up in the GDR.

87
00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.600
Otherwise, it is very thin.

88
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.720
The Unification Treaty
regulated differently.

89
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.680
Were you not invited,
because you were in the jungle camp?

90
00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.240
This is a decision
of each person,

91
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.480
to say what I do or don't do.

92
00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:18.840
I do not know
that in the Basic Law

93
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
a restriction of occupational bans
for former politicians.

94
00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.240
Do you think the CDU board sat
at the 1st episode of Dschungelcamp

95
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.760
in front of the TV with peanut flips
and watched that?

96
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.000
You have to ask the Board of Management,
I have not asked him.

97
00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.320
You're mad, aren't you?
I'm not mad. Why?

98
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.760
But you look angry.
I look angry?

99
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.760
Of course.
Do you look differently?

100
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.560
I look puzzled.

101
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.920
Now they laughed for example
Was what?

102
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:49.080
I am not angry.
It was something.

103
00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.720
Schäuble, your comrade-in-arms
in the Unification Treaty,

104
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.360
said in the interview,

105
00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.760
it had hurt him,
to see you in the jungle camp.

106
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.960
But that is my decision.

107
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.960
Is Schäuble watching jungle camp?

108
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.640
Do you think he has seen all
10 seasons? - Apparently so.

109
00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.760
As RTL informed me, was
probably this episode of the Dschungelcamp

110
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:20.400
with a relatively high
high audience rating.

111
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.000
I assume that
the Schäuble family was also watching.

112
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.840
Schäuble wrote in his book:

113
00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.400
"Krause wanted
nothing remain of the GDR."

114
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.040
He did apologize
something for it, but what did you want?

115
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.000
Did you want the GDR gone
or keep it?

116
00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.840
What Schäuble writes in his book
he must take responsibility for.

117
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.280
That I wanted to keep much of the GDR
I wanted to keep, can be ...

118
00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.480
One thing you
would have wanted to leave?

119
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.960
Not just one.
Now just one for us.

120
00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:59.480
E.g. the Federal Minister of the Interior said,

121
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.840
the Stasi files should
not be published.

122
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.960
He gave privacy reasons.
Not his, right? - I don't know.

123
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.320
I don't know them.
Neither do I.

124
00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:12.680
At this point
we prevailed:

125
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.120
Mr. Schäuble
wanted to introduce 218 in the GDR,

126
00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:21.280
we called the thing
"Pregnancy Interruption Act."

127
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:23.960
We arranged for it to stay.

128
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:28.560
There are X points in the Unification
treaty where we prevailed.

129
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:33.320
Or did you not want the GDR because
you already saw yourself in office in Bonn?

130
00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:35.480
That has nothing to do with it.

131
00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:40.960
Somehow none of the things
I'm asking you has anything to do with that.

132
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.840
No, that has nothing to do with it.
I always have to ask others.

133
00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.600
There should already be 12 people standing here,
because it is always said:

134
00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.400
"Ask him."
The problem was in the GDR ...

135
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.560
We let ourselves finish,
Mr. Krause.

136
00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.480
Yes, we let ourselves be talked out of it.

137
00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.800
The citizens' movement overturned the GDR,
in case that slipped your mind.

138
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.000
We had to be the last GDR government
pick up the pieces

139
00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:08.480
and create an orderly
legal transition.

140
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.720
This is the historical truth.

141
00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.800
After unification, you became Federal
Minister for Special Tasks

142
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:17.000
and in 1991 Federal Minister of Transport.

143
00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.480
Did you think:
"I did it"?

144
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:21.840
Why did I make it?

145
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:25.320
My job was to,
to take care of the infrastructure ...

146
00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.720
Can you, when you answer,
not always answer so negatively?

147
00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.400
I'm not answering negatively after all.
It's like, "Your question is stupid."

148
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:37.800
"Silly questions, Mr. Krömer"
always resonates.

149
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:41.480
Your question is
tends to be answered,

150
00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:43.520
as you have put them.

151
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.720
Chapeau.
Thank you.

152
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.920
Tourette's, or as they say.

153
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:55.760
I like to drink
a glass of Rotkäppchen sparkling wine,

154
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.120
when we want to toast,
when the score is tied.

155
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.240
Are you an advertising representative?
Always for the East.

156
00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.600
Can we name
other brands?

157
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:06.480
North star instead of Bauknecht.

158
00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:08.160
Ahoy sherbet?

159
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.080
Ahoy Krause, yes.

160
00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.760
That's when we did the gag, too.

161
00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.840
They were only in their late 30s
and came from the GDR.

162
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.800
Did your minister colleagues
take you seriously at all?

163
00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.560
You'll have to ask them.
Again.

164
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.880
I can't ...
I have accelerated the ...

165
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.120
From the feeling
you can say:

166
00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.160
"I wasn't taken seriously."
From the feeling ...

167
00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.680
You can't get through life with:
"Ask the others."

168
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.600
From the feeling ...
I come home at 4 o'clock at night

169
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:43.320
and my wife with the frying pan ...
... let us finish.

170
00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:46.720
...where are you from?,
I don't say, "Ask the others."

171
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.080
Why don't you let
not let me finish?

172
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:52.120
For example, we have ...
We are not on Anne Will:

173
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.880
Let me finish,
and I'll let you.

174
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.840
I'll let you finish now.

175
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.080
For example, I implemented
the accelerated planning law

176
00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:02.440
for the new federal states.

177
00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.840
If that means anything to you.

178
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.440
As a result, the planning times were
between 2-5 years in the east.

179
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:13.120
Today in the West we have
planning times of up to 30 years.

180
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.080
That is why today
the transport infrastructure

181
00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:20.240
in the new federal states
significantly better than in the west.

182
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.640
You're right, it's quarter 9.

183
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.760
Quarter 9? Can't be. Can it?

184
00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.560
Then it's 8:15.

185
00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:29.960
No, it's 10 pm ...

186
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.320
It is a recording.
It's live! - Is it?

187
00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.000
It is now Tuesday, 10:30 pm.

188
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.880
Good. - Thank you, Ingrid.

189
00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.680
Here's how it works.

190
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.640
As a minister, you were nicknamed
the nickname Sause-Krause.

191
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.280
Did you like it?

192
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.520
He was referring to the pace
with which they worked.

193
00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:57.400
It's nice. Do you know
another Sause-Krause?

194
00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:59.920
I would have to ask the others.
Exactly.

195
00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:06.000
You were the 2nd great,
German politician,

196
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:08.520
who had something to do with
had something to do with highways.

197
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.000
That's not true,
I did the rail reform, for example.

198
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.320
I had very much
for the railroad

199
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.720
- for example.

200
00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:24.520
After two years
they resigned in May 1993.

201
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:27.760
Were they so fast at work,

202
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:30.720
that in 2 years
you had everything ready?

203
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.080
It is a private matter.

204
00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:39.400
The issue was,
that in our marriage,

205
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.320
that's where it gets more serious,
had problems.

206
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.800
My wife and I agreed
that we would take the chance,

207
00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.320
to start things
with a fresh start.

208
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.960
Okay. - Private.

209
00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.960
Have you talked out?
I have talked out.

210
00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.000
Good, then it would be my turn again.

211
00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.040
Actually, you resigned,

212
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:04.120
because you took every headline
about your person, right?

213
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.440
There were many headlines
that simply weren't true.

214
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:11.920
We have collected some highlights
together. - Please.

215
00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.760
Discipline: you have not been to an
committee you were not,

216
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:19.960
because you had previously celebrated yourself
in the restaurant.

217
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.480
What was going on?

218
00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:27.200
I do not remember that
there was the committee of inquiry.

219
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.440
There were ...
Because they were drunk.

220
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.560
No, there were in my team

221
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:35.040
a secretary of state,
who denounced me,

222
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.840
I would have supposedly in one evening,

223
00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000
than we
the accelerated planning law,

224
00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:46.240
ministers and
three secretaries of state, celebrated,

225
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.280
allegedly played the Deutschlandlied
played on a piano.

226
00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:52.200
This is not possible at all.

227
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:56.160
You can only play the anthem of the Germans
on a piano.

228
00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.360
So the others were to blame.
No.

229
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:01.560
Was a duck?
That was a duck.

230
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:04.320
There was no
investigative committee.

231
00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.600
... Investigation committee, there
people didn't want anything from you?

232
00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.680
Was not. Could be,
that people wanted something.

233
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.280
Committees of inquiry
there are enough.

234
00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:17.320
Another headline:
The theme of modesty.

235
00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.920
As a minister, you received
a handsome monthly salary,

236
00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.600
around 30,000 deutschmarks.

237
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.800
Nevertheless, you had your cleaning lady
70% from the employment office.

238
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.640
Not true after all.
The Berliner Zeitung ...

239
00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.320
Was a neighbor?
Shall we pronounce?

240
00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.800
The Berliner Zeitung
kindly corrected

241
00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.480
a few weeks ago:

242
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.040
There were for the new federal states

243
00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.000
an order
from the Federal Minister of Labor, Mr. Blüm.

244
00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.760
Do you have the report with you?
I do not.

245
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.280
Then my report counts.
But you can read it later.

246
00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.120
But it is wrong. - FAZ.

247
00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.280
This is the FAZ from 100 years ago.
That's when it happened.

248
00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.160
That must have happened during the
in the D-Mark era. - That is not true.

249
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.880
Unless,
the scandal was 2 days ago.

250
00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:08.040
My wife realized
for a long-term unemployed

251
00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.640
a full workstation.

252
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.040
The legal regulation was called:

253
00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.760
The non-wage labor costs are
taken over by the state for 2 years.

254
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.480
That made my wife
as an employer.

255
00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.440
That had nothing to do with me.
So fine out.

256
00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.360
It was a law for the East,
but it did not apply to the Krause family,

257
00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:29.840
because, like
with the invitation to 30 years,

258
00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.480
I am neither a citizen
nor a functionary.

259
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.880
So it was a duck. - That was a duck.
Fake news from the FAZ.

260
00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:38.480
And everyone wrote it off.
Smut sheet.

261
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.280
Nah, the Berliner Zeitung
brought this out.

262
00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.040
Do you have the report with you?

263
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:46.760
You should have said
I should bring the report,

264
00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.280
if you
can not research.

265
00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:51.120
Can you get it quickly?

266
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:55.720
Then the car service has to drive me home.
The report is there.

267
00:14:55.880 --> 00:14:59.680
You get 2.90 euros for
a ticket of the BVG maybe.

268
00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:01.640
So, Mr. Krause ...

269
00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.320
The BVG does not go everywhere.
It does.

270
00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.440
I don't live in Berlin.
Doesn't matter. - Not indifferent.

271
00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.120
Then go to the C area,
then continue by bus.

272
00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:14.640
Then I have to walk.
But the C-area will be more expensive.

273
00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.240
I will
charge it to the rbb.

274
00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:20.440
Do it,
we are happy about every invoice.

275
00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:23.680
You still had
a small political comeback

276
00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.800
as district chairman
of the CDU in Rostock.

277
00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.160
Yes, I accept the election.

278
00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.800
* Applause *

279
00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:35.240
I wish you every success and
continue to participate in the district executive committee.

280
00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.040
All the best. - Thank you.

281
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:43.120
Some brought out of sheer joy
a large bouquet of flowers.

282
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.840
Another was more reserved.

283
00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.600
I do not have flowers.

284
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:52.080
I congratulate you warmly ...
Flowers come later.

285
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:55.560
... hope for good cooperation.
Surely that works out.

286
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.880
Angela Merkel was her successor
as state chairwoman

287
00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.840
in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.

288
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.360
She had no flowers for you?

289
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.000
She just likes to save.

290
00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.600
Is this what friendship looks like?

291
00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.480
I don't know.

292
00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:15.480
I would have brought her
probably brought her flowers.

293
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.320
But she just didn't have one.

294
00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.360
In 1990, they helped Merkel
to a mandate in the Bundestag.

295
00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.240
Would Merkel never have become
never become chancellor

296
00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:27.160
and Germany
been doomed?

297
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.960
You certainly can't say.

298
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:32.320
That is already the lifetime achievement
of Angela Merkel.

299
00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.280
What is your relationship
with Mrs. Merkel today?

300
00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.720
Still good.
Did they get flowers for the 30th anniversary?

301
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:40.360
Still good.

302
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:46.760
No, I did not get flowers, but
friendly birthday greetings for 30.

303
00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.720
Have the secretary write.

304
00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:53.560
No, with original signature,
not stamped.

305
00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:57.200
Mr. Krause, we at the station
all put together.

306
00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.440
That's nice though.

307
00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:06.040
Happy 30th.

308
00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.240
Because it is so beautiful,
I give it back to you.

309
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.760
No, this is a gift for you.

310
00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.480
Just as they put away my gift
put away, I'll put that one away too.

311
00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.480
Pack it in water,
otherwise it will wither.

312
00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.840
What is the secret of success
of Angela Merkel?

313
00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.560
Did she slime around
or how did that go down?

314
00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:32.720
She did little wrong,
you have to admit.

315
00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.080
Everything done right.

316
00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.280
I am a non-smoker,
I ask you not to.

317
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.240
It is the law in Germany,

318
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.680
the person sitting
sitting across from you:

319
00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.080
Do you mind
that I smoke?

320
00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.760
I do mind. - Do you
mind that I smoke?

321
00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.400
Yes, because that is not a role model
for our youth.

322
00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:00.280
* Vacuum cleaner noise *

323
00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.920
Addiction, Mr. Krause.

324
00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:32.920
It's bad when you're addicted.

325
00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.040
Does the CDU
Become more conservative again

326
00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:39.240
or have they already lost all their voters
to the AfD?

327
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.880
I cannot understand with today's
not understand with today's poll numbers,

328
00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:47.680
what is this thesis about?

329
00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.120
The CDU has 34-36
according to the polls

330
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.680
still enough voters,

331
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.520
to become the strongest force in Germany
to become the strongest force in Germany. - Is it in a good position?

332
00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.120
Whether she is in a good position,
I can't say.

333
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.040
Stands badly.
I was ...

334
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.320
CDU is in a bad position, would be ...

335
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.240
The CDU is in a good position
well in relation to the others.

336
00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:13.120
So she's in a good position.
You contradict yourself.

337
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.280
When I imagine
that the SPD is a benchmark,

338
00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:17.920
the CDU is in a good position.

339
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.640
Sure, a bag of rice,
that has fallen over,

340
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.400
in contrast to the SPD, is also
is in a good position. - Everything is relative in life.

341
00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:28.240
In the 90s you wanted to
as a private banker

342
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:30.960
and invested 12.5 million deutschmarks.

343
00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.760
Where did you get the money?

344
00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.800
There are banks in Germany.

345
00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.280
They went to the bank,
borrowed 12.5 million

346
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.560
and founded a bank with it?

347
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:44.600
It was not 12.5 million.
How many were there?

348
00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.560
Ask the bank.
Ask the others.

349
00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.600
Was when they went to the new bank,
the bag heavy or light?

350
00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.040
That was not a bag.
That was a bank transfer.

351
00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.720
Oh, a referral.

352
00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.200
Is that peanuts for you,
that they forgot that?

353
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.200
That's not peanuts at all.

354
00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:07.360
But you know,
it hasn't been that long,

355
00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.000
how much money it was.

356
00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:12.600
I can tell you exactly,
that was 26-27 years ago.

357
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.560
Do you know if you
should reach the age of 67,

358
00:20:18.720 --> 00:20:21.280
smoke less,
it can happen,

359
00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.880
what then 27 years ago
was in detail?

360
00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.760
You don't know that there either.

361
00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.200
If I transfer
once in my life, I will transfer 12.5 million euros,

362
00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.120
or D-Mark in that case,
that one remembers.

363
00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.640
You don't have to remember it.
Why?

364
00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:40.080
They want me to believe,
you don't know how much money...

365
00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.760
I want to make you
rather make something black.

366
00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.880
Then in the future you must
vote the right way: the CDU.

367
00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.280
The CDU is not in a good position,
you just said.

368
00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:53.160
It's in a very good position, I said.
You said badly. - No.

369
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.720
This is how white becomes black.

370
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.320
We cut it together like this,

371
00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:03.280
that they say the CDU is
in a bad position. - Why don't you do that?

372
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:06.080
Cut ...
This is how television works.

373
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:09.600
Of course, that's how it works.
That's how it was with the cleaning lady.

374
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:14.000
We morph a smile on your face in the "Post".
smile on your face. - Please don't.

375
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:19.560
But you haven't heard much from the
not heard much more, wa?

376
00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.680
I don't know.

377
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.000
Do you know anything at all?

378
00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:27.360
I ask you, what is 2 + 2?

379
00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:30.040
Let's talk
about neutrinos.

380
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.240
We'll get to that.
I give you my word of honor.

381
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.600
Did you then,
when you received this 12.5 million,

382
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:41.240
let's estimate
something in the millions,

383
00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:45.360
what they may have transferred ...
Do we agree? It was expensive.

384
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.000
It was expensive.
I don't remember how much.

385
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:51.680
It was in the millions,
let's put it that way. - It was expensive.

386
00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.240
12,5.
This is certainly wrong.

387
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:58.400
Said no one from their environment:
Krause, step on the brakes,

388
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.800
you drive the Porsche
against the wall?

389
00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.400
I have never driven a Porsche.

390
00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:10.040
They also tried their hand
in construction: East real estate. - Hm.

391
00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.800
Trial against Günther Krause begins.

392
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.640
The former federal minister
stands before the Rostock Regional Court

393
00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:22.960
for embezzlement,
fraud and tax evasion.

394
00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.480
The ex-minister
is said to be, among other things, a company director

395
00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:28.840
through speculation
have embezzled 6 million euros.

396
00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:31.440
The verdict is expected
expected at the beginning of July.

397
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.760
Let me guess,
You don't remember anything.

398
00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:38.000
I remember it very well.

399
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:40.240
The verdict from the Rostock court,

400
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.720
that's not in their records,

401
00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.400
was overturned 100% by the BGH.

402
00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:48.360
Most of the charges
were acquitted.

403
00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:50.600
It didn't say that anywhere in the paper.

404
00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:54.640
The rbb also forgot to report.
They were not in jail, but ...

405
00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.440
That has nothing to do with it.
They got 14 months probation.

406
00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.880
That was an appeal hearing,
something completely different.

407
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.600
I am interested in the
6 million euros, where did the money go?

408
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.480
Switzerland, Liechtenstein,
the own garden?

409
00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:14.320
Where would they have gone?

410
00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:16.960
They went into construction projects.
Uh-huh.

411
00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.320
Of course.
Which one?

412
00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:23.560
The miracle play was called Volkshaus,
if you remember.

413
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.440
Of these
over 500 were built in Germany.

414
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.000
For 6 million? - The 6 million
was nowhere near enough.

415
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.240
Oh, there was more money involved?

416
00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.760
They were not wooden sheds,
but real houses.

417
00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:40.280
Would you give yourself a loan
for 6 million euros?

418
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.760
Yes, why not?
But do not forget.

419
00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.600
Now I have to laugh
laugh for a moment myself, Mr. Krause.

420
00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:52.480
That has not happened to me yet.
That's nice.

421
00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:55.000
Mr. Krause ...
Have you learned.

422
00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:57.680
Can we stop for a moment,
the cameras off.

423
00:23:57.840 --> 00:24:00.360
Mr. Krause,
I need a break now.

424
00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.640
That is, also fits from the jacket,

425
00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.800
as if Captain Blue Bear
sits opposite me.

426
00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.320
The break is not agreed.
It is ... - Not a break.

427
00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:14.200
Short break, I'll take a breather.
Sause-Krause, but no break.

428
00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:17.800
We take a short break,
turn off all cameras for a moment.

429
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.120
I do not want
laugh on the show,

430
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.400
it is otherwise said that is against you.

431
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.040
* (groans)

432
00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.520
May I call you
Klabauter-Krause from now on?

433
00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.880
Light a cigarette.

434
00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.400
I tolerate it,
so that they become calmer.

435
00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.080
That I smoke one, yes?

436
00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:38.000
Yes, but go
best into the audience.

437
00:24:40.800 --> 00:24:42.960
Klabauter-Krause. - Well.

438
00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.560
* audible exhalation *

439
00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.720
Man, man, man.

440
00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:50.600
Do you have your mind made up
what you're going to say?

441
00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:52.840
Someday a master will come.

442
00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:55.080
Are you the master?

443
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.600
Master Eder, or what?
For you in any case.

444
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.680
And I'm Pumuckl, or what?

445
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.160
The audience wants
to laugh, too, right? - Please?

446
00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:09.400
Don't be so serious.
The audience wants to laugh?

447
00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.040
Their lives are at stake.

448
00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.040
You are not a joke,
this really all happened.

449
00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.440
That's just not what happened.
Nothing?

450
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.040
I do not say nothing.

451
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:23.200
But the cleaning lady affair was not one.

452
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.840
It was German law, which
my wife at the time used.

453
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.360
It has nothing at all ...
No.

454
00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.560
Left pocket, right pocket?
That is the insinuation.

455
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:39.080
When an employer employs a
employs a long-term unemployed person

456
00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:42.160
and there is a law
which says,

457
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:44.920
the ancillary wage costs are paid,

458
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.880
then the law in Germany
not to the Krause family,

459
00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.040
because Krause is, of course, neither a citizen
nor a functionary.

460
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.080
Do you always talk
about yourself in the third person?

461
00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:59.320
You have to, that's what
we came up with in Germany.

462
00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:02.680
Is that Krause law?
That has nothing to do with it.

463
00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.720
Now we have to
about a new stroke of genius

464
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.240
of our Glücksritter,
Prof. Dr. Hastig, will speak.

465
00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.800
You want to use neutrinos
save the world?

466
00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.960
The book that you ...

467
00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.800
Neutrinos,
for understanding, what is it?

468
00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:24.480
Is this a pop band
from the GDR - "Lost Neutrinos"?

469
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.720
Explain to us briefly,
what this is all about.

470
00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.480
Neutrinos are particles,

471
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.800
which permanently
and continuously from space

472
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.600
hit our planet with at least the speed of light.
speed of light.

473
00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.120
On your thumbnail
or on my

474
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:45.160
60 billion particles
per second per square centimeter.

475
00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.840
How many neutrinos
are in space right now?

476
00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.520
That's hundreds of trillions.

477
00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:53.920
Were there more neutrinos in the GDR
than in the FRG?

478
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:56.400
No, on this planet

479
00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.320
the share of natural
neutrinos is equally distributed worldwide.

480
00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:04.200
I do not deny that they exist,
I don't deny that. - But?

481
00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:08.720
We asked
with Prof. Dr. Christian Stegmann,

482
00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.960
Director for the field of
Astro Particle Physics

483
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.640
at the German electron synchrotron.

484
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:19.040
He told us the following
about neutrinos. - Gladly.

485
00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.800
From my point of view,
you can get from neutrinos

486
00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:24.400
do not generate electrical energy.

487
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.240
Then you have to condense the matter,
that we know, condensed.

488
00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.440
An example: Take
the Alps and compress them

489
00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:35.720
on a block of this size,

490
00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:39.800
then one can stop a part
of the neutrinos from the sun.

491
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:43.560
From my point of view, you cannot develop
develop such a material.

492
00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:45.760
We can't do that on earth.

493
00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:48.440
However, I invite all
who try this,

494
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.480
publish the results,
you have, put yourself

495
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:56.080
the debate
in the scientific community.

496
00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.600
This is certainly
more promising,

497
00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.440
better than YouTube
or the jungle camp.

498
00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:06.640
Why do you believe in it anyway?
I do not believe in it.

499
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.400
I have done it.
I can prove that.

500
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:13.960
I have written the book,
you only need to read it ...

501
00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.000
In books ...?
Let me finish.

502
00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:19.960
In books you can
write a lot into them.

503
00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.800
After all, that's not proof.

504
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:24.560
This is the argumentation
of the Politburo.

505
00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:27.680
That has been over for 30 years
fortunately over.

506
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.000
What comes next,
Professor Wunderlich?

507
00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.720
What, Professor Wunderlich?
Find the Amber Room

508
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.560
and let everyone webbed
grow between your fingers?

509
00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.800
I'm looking for it from you. You must have
a collection of amber.

510
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.360
That was quite a party, Mr. Krause.

511
00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:49.720
Of course, that's why
that's why they called me in. - Yes.

512
00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:56.000
You know, all this talk
about the future of the planet

513
00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.080
is then no longer gossip,

514
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:02.960
when through innovation
really does something the planet.

515
00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.080
Remember these words.

516
00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:07.920
I'll write it down.
Write it down.

517
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.960
So, Mr. Krause, that's it.

518
00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:15.160
Follow me unobtrusively.
* audible exhale *

519
00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.800
* Applause *

520
00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.880
Like this.
* audible exhale *

521
00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.000
Dear Mr. Krause, ...

522
00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.440
... come home safe and sound.

523
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:35.680
Take care, neighbors, bye.

524
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.480
* Charles Aznavour:
"For me formidable" *
