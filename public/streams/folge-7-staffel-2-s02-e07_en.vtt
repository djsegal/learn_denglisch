00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.600
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.440
((Jänicke) Several times
the keyword "pillory day"

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.560
for a secret operation).

5
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.640
The train is sent back,
with the gold.

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.000
There is no gold in the wagon.
There is.

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.800
The wagon numbers
have been exchanged.

8
00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.400
The gold is to be taken out.

9
00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.960
From men
of the "Black Reichswehr".

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.240
When?
Tomorrow.

11
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.920
(Attention!

12
00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.840
Let us allow the Prussian spirit
flow into this matter.

13
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.400
The President of the Reich has decreed,

14
00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.800
the train as quickly as possible
back to the Soviet Union as quickly as possible.

15
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.760
Immediately. Without further examination.

16
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.560
Fritz.
- Gretchen.

17
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.680
We were ratted out.

18
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.600
Gretchen, run! Run!

19
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.000
*shot*

20
00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.640
Fritz! No!
They shot at him!

21
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.600
The guys,
who shot Fritz,

22
00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.760
Those were Benda's people.

23
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.720
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

24
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.320
*tick*

25
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.720
*uncanny music

26
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.800
*rhythmic music

27
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.520
*Groans*

28
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.360
Do you have to go again?

29
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.760
Not yet.

30
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.400
Our hotel ratio

31
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.400
is starting to feel
just as secretive as at home.

32
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.120
We have to find an apartment.

33
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.960
*There's a knock.

34
00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.720
Is that the boy already?

35
00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.320
Can't be,
he rides the Ringbahn.

36
00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.960
*It knocks again.

37
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.000
Charlotte!
Where are you from?

38
00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.400
Has the train left already?
What?

39
00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.920
He goes back
to the Soviet Union.

40
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.320
Where have you been?
When exactly is he going back?

41
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.960
They're waiting downstairs.
I'll be there in five minutes.

42
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.160
Who was that?

43
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.560
A colleague.

44
00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.200
It's something urgent.

45
00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.360
I'll have to take care of that.

46
00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.640
(Irmgard)
Have the children already packed?

47
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.720
Greta?

48
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.760
Have the children packed yet?
- (Boy) I've packed.

49
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.880
(Irmgard) You shall speak,
when you are asked.

50
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.480
Jakob is packed.

51
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.520
And I help Margot
after lunch.

52
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.560
(Irmgard) That's how we do it.

53
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.960
(When does your train leave?

54
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.640
In two hours
at Szczecin station.

55
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.320
I'll drive you there
and then to the office.

56
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.400
Why are you crying?

57
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.560
(Irmgard) I'll be right back.

58
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:01.960
Greta?

59
00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.320
Come on.

60
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.440
*She sobs.

61
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.600
You're such a good girl.

62
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.600
And pretty!

63
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.880
Well, you see.

64
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.640
We won't let them get us down.

65
00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.480
I'm going to finish packing.

66
00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.120
Good, do that.

67
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.760
Charlotte?
I've been looking for you everywhere.

68
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.360
They were right,
Jänicke was onto Wolter.

69
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.680
Where were you?
I'll tell you later.

70
00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.720
Come on, we have to go!

71
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.520
Where to?
To Benda.

72
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.400
On Sunday?
Yes, get on board.

73
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.680
*exciting music*

74
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:16.520
Wolter meets State Secretary Wendt
and Alfred Nyssen,

75
00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:18.680
accompanied by a woman,

76
00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.800
whom Nyssen
as "Countess Sorokina".

77
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.320
Svetlana Sorokina?
Yes, exactly.

78
00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.720
They're talking about
that they're robbing the train.

79
00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.440
While he is still being
is sent back to Russia.

80
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.720
And that is here: Kilometer 127.

81
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:36.720
But what does Wolter
with 20 tons of poison gas?

82
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.560
It's not about the gas.
It's about a hidden freight.

83
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.360
The gold of the Sorokins?

84
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.640
How do you know about the gold?

85
00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.720
Sorokina
has spoken about it.

86
00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.560
You have
met Svetlana Sorokina?

87
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.680
Yes, but I didn't take that
seriously about the gold.

88
00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.400
The Sorokina
has swapped the wagon numbers.

89
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:05.160
AB 3221 was opened during the raid
was opened by the engine shed.

90
00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.280
And in wagon TY 2305
now contains the gold.

91
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.160
Everyone will try
stop the train before it reaches the border.

92
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.320
Who is "everyone", please?

93
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:15.560
Well, Wolter.

94
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.600
And Nyssen.

95
00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.640
Should we pack the evening dress
for Mariechen?

96
00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.360
We are
in the garden all the time.

97
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:34.000
When mom does her exercises,
with Dr. Hutten.

98
00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.360
*He coughs.

99
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:40.760
Are you getting sick?

100
00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.880
Alone with mom
it's so boring.

101
00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.160
I don't want to drive without you.

102
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.720
Please, children.

103
00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.160
(Margot)
Why were you crying earlier?

104
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.680
Because I was sad, because ...
That I haven't seen you for so long.

105
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:05.280
Then Mariechen will stay
with you until then.

106
00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240
Thank you.

107
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.480
*The doorbell rings.

108
00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.640
Charlotte.
What are you doing here?

109
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:23.880
This is ...

110
00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:26.440
Gereon Rath.
Is the government council there?

111
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.680
Please.

112
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.360
What's going on?

113
00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.560
Sorry,
it's really important.

114
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.160
Come in,
I don't have much time.

115
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:43.600
Miss Overbeck, please offer
please offer the lady something to drink.

116
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:46.920
What would you like?
I can make tea ...

117
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.320
Nothing, thank you.

118
00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.320
I need the most
experienced task force,

119
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.800
maybe twelve men.

120
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.760
It's too late for that.

121
00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.240
If we catch Wolter
on the train ...

122
00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.960
We are no longer
about the train.

123
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.880
Wolter is a small fish.
We'll catch him one day.

124
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.640
He has Stefan Jänicke
on his conscience.

125
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.240
Can you prove that?

126
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:11.600
Not yet.

127
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.720
But we both know
that it was him.

128
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:17.840
Lotte?

129
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.840
Lotte? Can we see each other?
I need to talk to someone.

130
00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:26.440
Your guy?

131
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:29.000
No ...

132
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.280
Oh, send him packing,
the bastard.

133
00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.280
Greta,
no guy in the world is worth it.

134
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.840
I am sure that Gennat is taking
all the necessary measures,

135
00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.160
if your suspicions are confirmed.

136
00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.360
This damn train
please let it go.

137
00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.720
If you'll excuse me,

138
00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.480
I have to
take care of my family.

139
00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.640
Jänicke was set up by you
as an informer on Wolter.

140
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:09.440
You have exposed him
extremely high risk.

141
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:11.920
This is not
your responsibility.

142
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:16.160
After all, it's probably
a whole wagon full of gold.

143
00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.560
We have to sweep up the pieces.
We played and lost.

144
00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.000
In a few weeks

145
00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:30.800
probably none of us will be
sitting in our chairs.

146
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.360
We'll take care of Wolter,
when the time is right.

147
00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.320
Who wants to buy which precious metals from
wants to buy,

148
00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:37.760
is none of our business.

149
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.840
Please.
With only a dozen men ...

150
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.280
You have apparently
still not understood.

151
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.200
The State Secretary Wendt

152
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.400
on behalf of the President of the Reich
releases the train today.

153
00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.320
At exactly 3 pm.

154
00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.000
Excuse me.

155
00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:06.800
*exciting music*

156
00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.840
And what do we do now?

157
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.400
Kilometer marker 127,
We have to find it.

158
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.600
*exciting music*

159
00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.240
Here.

160
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.400
We have to head towards ...
towards Wünsdorf.

161
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.920
Then here to this lake
and always along the water.

162
00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:45.320
Kilometer 127 is approximately here.

163
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.880
All right.

164
00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:54.440
(Come on.

165
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:55.920
Good?

166
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.160
So then.

167
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.960
*exciting music*

168
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.680
(Man, telephone) Yes, please?

169
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.760
It's me. They're gone now.
You can come.

170
00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.400
*exciting music*

171
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.720
Everything prepared?
- Yes.

172
00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.480
Listen to me, Henning.

173
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.120
Grab the
the fastest car

174
00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.200
and take the same route.

175
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.960
Kilometers 127.
Complete equipment.

176
00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.600
Yes. Security level four.
With all the trimmings.

177
00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:22.800
Yes, gas masks too.
Hurry up.

178
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.760
They are on their way.

179
00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.360
*exciting music*

180
00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.200
*exciting music*

181
00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:09.560
*There's a knock.

182
00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.800
Right, so where?

183
00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:27.440
Study?
Where is the study?

184
00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:28.800
This way.

185
00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840
There.

186
00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:15.440
*exciting music*

187
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.880
Here, hold this.

188
00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.000
Otto, I don't know ...

189
00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.480
It's too late for that now, girl.

190
00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:00.680
That doesn't bring Fritz
alive again.

191
00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.480
Hold this.
- I'm scared.

192
00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:04.320
(Otto) Very carefully.

193
00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.360
Otto ...
- Sch.

194
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.400
(The other way around.

195
00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:11.400
So.

196
00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.800
*exciting music*

197
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.960
Take a look inside my jacket.

198
00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.920
Right side pocket.

199
00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.160
Who signed it?

200
00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.280
Benda.

201
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.720
(So ...

202
00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:54.400
This is the ignition mechanism,
You'll arm it later.

203
00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.000
Twirl the wires together
and put them back into the hole.

204
00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.840
But only
just before the old man is back.

205
00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.800
And don't wait too long either.

206
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:14.600
When he pulls open the drawer,
the load goes up.

207
00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:17.320
Then you must be out of here,
Got it?

208
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:18.560
Yes.

209
00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.160
Best of all,
you really disappear.

210
00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:34.400
Get out of the city.

211
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.520
Here.

212
00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.760
We do that for Fritz.

213
00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.920
Can I call you?

214
00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.000
We will get back to you.

215
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.720
*She exhales deeply.

216
00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.400
(Woman) Operator.

217
00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.680
Please put me through
with the police headquarters.

218
00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.160
(One moment, please.

219
00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:39.360
(man)
Police headquarters, you wish?

220
00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:40.880
Sorry.

221
00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.800
I am looking for a female commissioner ...
Assistant Ritter.

222
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.720
(Which department?

223
00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:49.840
In the homicide department,
Homicide, yes.

224
00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.680
Inspection A, murder.
- Yes.

225
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.880
One moment, please.
- Yes, I'll wait.

226
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.240
There is no criminal
assistant under the name.

227
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:08.320
Are you sure?
- Yes.

228
00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.400
I can't help you any further.
- I see.

229
00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.600
Good, thank you.

230
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:32.880
Charlotte.

231
00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.880
Where were you?

232
00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.440
If there is a time
when you have to tell me everything,

233
00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:48.680
then now.

234
00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.400
What does he want?

235
00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:52.280
*Honk*

236
00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.600
*Honk*
Gereon!

237
00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.440
*exciting music*

238
00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:41.760
*She breathes frantically.

239
00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:52.440
*stressed sounds*

240
00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.800
Gereon!

241
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.520
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!

242
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:58.440
Wake up!

243
00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.120
Wake up!

244
00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:03.560
I'm stuck.

245
00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:09.000
*stressed sounds*

246
00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:14.800
*She screams.

247
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.640
*exciting music*

248
00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.560
No.

249
00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.200
*He screams.

250
00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:45.800
*He screams.

251
00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.000
*He coughs and gasps for breath.

252
00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:27.960
*He screams.

253
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.000
*Gereon's cry is drowned out
drowned out by the ringing of the bells.

254
00:26:43.280 --> 00:26:47.400
(The brave men,
we want to honor today,

255
00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:52.680
were prepared to give something,
that no one can give them back.

256
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:55.160
Your youth.

257
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.360
Your future.

258
00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.160
Your life.

259
00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:08.200
You gave it to us.
To our German fatherland.

260
00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.440
Who is the man?
- Please?

261
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.840
From the foundation.

262
00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:19.640
Who supported us,
after Dad didn't come back.

263
00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:23.920
Which is supposed to finance your studies.
- I don't want to study.

264
00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:28.280
Thank you and now please
Mrs. Helga Rath from Cologne,

265
00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:32.840
widow of the lieutenant
of the infantry Anno Rath, to me.

266
00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:35.800
Without me this time, yes?

267
00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.280
I would like to thank the Annemarie Nyssen
Foundation for the invitation.

268
00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.480
For the opportunity
to speak here. Thank you.

269
00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:10.280
I came to Berlin with my son
to Berlin with my son, Moritz.

270
00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:14.560
Moritz, who never
never got to know his father.

271
00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.960
When I learned of the loss of my husband
of my husband,

272
00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.240
Moritz had not yet been born.

273
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.680
My husband was considered missing,
from where ...

274
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.520
where the early happiness
of togetherness

275
00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.800
should finally become a "we".
The three of us.

276
00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240
Loss.

277
00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.640
Loneliness.

278
00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.640
Melancholy.

279
00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:45.000
*sob*

280
00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:52.640
Excuse me.

281
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.240
I always say that,
that I am grateful.

282
00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.120
But today I see for the first time

283
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.760
a member of the Nyssen family
in person.

284
00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:11.760
Your company, Nyssen AG,

285
00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:16.280
is the largest arms manufacturer
of the German Reich.

286
00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.120
Who is responsible
for the manufacture of weapons,

287
00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.960
with which our men
were killed,

288
00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.960
can't give all the
consolation for the losses,

289
00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.840
that we have suffered.

290
00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.240
*mumble*

291
00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:43.920
Mr. Nyssen, you and your family -
I am grateful for your help.

292
00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.600
But I also despise
what you do.

293
00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.640
*She sobs.

294
00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.320
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

295
00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:03.720
Mrs. Rath.

296
00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:09.000
What do you think if I
invite you to dinner afterwards

297
00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.840
and we can talk in peace?

298
00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:58.680
*Clock ticks and whirs
and plays a melody.

299
00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.240
*depressing music

300
00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.400
*exciting music*

301
00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.600
*exciting music*

302
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.240
*She breathes shakily.

303
00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.400
*driving music

304
00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:54.800
*Door opens.

305
00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.800
Good evening, Miss Overbeck.
Are you still going out?

306
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.560
(stammers) I wanted to go
go buy beer,

307
00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.960
before you come.

308
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:10.960
Have we run out of beer in the cellar?
- Yes, we do.

309
00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:14.480
Yes, yes, yes. I thought
it's not cold enough.

310
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.880
You are quite confused.

311
00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.800
Leave it alone,
We do things differently today.

312
00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.120
I take care of the drinks
and you prepare the food.

313
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.000
Today you are
keep me company for once.

314
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.120
*She exhales deeply.

315
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:23.320
Are you ready, Miss Overbeck?

316
00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:32.400
Hh!

317
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.360
*She breathes shakily.

318
00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.640
15 Peter.

319
00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:06.640
You've never
you've never drunk before.

320
00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:12.440
... we examine the
municipal hospital care.

321
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.920
Four years ago
sold to the Sklarek brothers

322
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.680
from the city of Berlin

323
00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:20.920
with the approval
of the Lord Mayor Böß.

324
00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:22.520
Only that one company,

325
00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.400
which is responsible for the official
responsible for the official textile supply,

326
00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.360
can hardly charge for fur coats
can charge for fur coats, right?

327
00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.400
Who needs a mink in hospital?
a mink in a hospital?

328
00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.400
Or with the police?

329
00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.440
Miss Overbeck,

330
00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:42.880
The wine cost me a sixth
of my monthly salary.

331
00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:48.760
Well, and that brings us to
the wife of the Lord Mayor:

332
00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.240
Anna Böß.

333
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:51.600
*Clock ticks.

334
00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.960
They must be suffering terribly.

335
00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:03.400
He should be ashamed of himself, the guy,
a lovely girl like you.

336
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.200
*Melody of the clock*

337
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:35.840
*knock*

338
00:36:36.800 --> 00:36:38.960
Do you still need me?
Mr. Government Councillor?

339
00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.200
No.

340
00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:42.240
Oh, um, Greta?

341
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.920
Mr. Government Councillor?

342
00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:47.920
Tell me the name
of the guy,

343
00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.560
I'll have him arrested and
for meanness.

344
00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:02.280
*Door is opened
and closed*.

345
00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:31.000
(gently) Get out,
we are back.

346
00:37:32.680 --> 00:37:33.840
*He coughs.

347
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:39.760
Greta?

348
00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:43.800
What a surprise!

349
00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:47.280
Did something happen?

350
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.720
Jakob has a fever.

351
00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.280
Where is the girl?

352
00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.800
I have released it.
Lovesickness.

353
00:37:54.840 --> 00:37:57.280
You are spared
spared nothing.

354
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.920
I put the children to bed.

355
00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:05.120
*Jakob coughs.

356
00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:13.120
Mom will make you a cup of tea in a minute
and you will sleep well.

357
00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:14.440
(Mom ...

358
00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.400
One island of Usedom, please.

359
00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:35.960
There and back?
- Simple.

360
00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:40.800
8.50. That's right here
by the track. That's the one.

361
00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.720
Ouch!
- Sorry.

362
00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.280
I was too fast.

363
00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.400
Extra!

364
00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.800
Bribery of the municipal
hospital care!

365
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:57.120
Sklarek brothers under suspicion!
Extra sheet! Bribery! Scandal!

366
00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.560
*People shouting in confusion.

367
00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:07.280
Traitor to the people! Jew pig! Pig!

368
00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:09.880
You bastard!
what is your wife wearing?

369
00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:11.920
Fur and mink on the Jewish body!

370
00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.600
But of course
I'm going out there now.

371
00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:16.240
Mr. Mayor ...

372
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.000
* angry shouts of protest*

373
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.240
(quietly) Dad?

374
00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:35.480
Can I be with you, Dad?
I can't sleep.

375
00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.600
Where's your mom?
- She's with Jakob.

376
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:40.400
Mhm.

377
00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:42.960
Well, come here then.

378
00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.760
Do you want to
help me with my work, will you?

379
00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:52.000
Well, watch out then.

380
00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.440
Then please sign it
... here.

381
00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:05.400
Gentlemen!
Please come to your senses!

382
00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:08.800
I give you my word.

383
00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:13.320
* angry shouts of protest*

384
00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.640
(Böß) You can't treat each other
with each other!

385
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:30.680
I order
to clear this station!

386
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.840
*exciting music*

387
00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.640
I appeal to your common sense
and to your decency!

388
00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:44.240
How do you talk to me?!
I won't put up with it!

389
00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:50.920
*She breathes deeply.

390
00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.120
Ah!

391
00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.480
*He groans.

392
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.880
Fritz.

393
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.840
Please?

394
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.360
What are you doing here?

395
00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.920
Fritz ...

396
00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.800
Fritz, what are you doing here?

397
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.880
You must have me confused.

398
00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:38.520
Tell me, what are you doing here, Fritz?

399
00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:42.200
You have me confused.
- What are you doing here? Fritz!

400
00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.200
What are you doing here?

401
00:41:45.280 --> 00:41:46.280
*She screams.

402
00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.120
*She groans.

403
00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.720
(Police! Get away from here!

404
00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.160
*People shouting in confusion.

405
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:14.960
*exciting music*

406
00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.400
*exciting music*

407
00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:52.200
*exciting music*

408
00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.520
So ...

409
00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.880
My darling, enough work.
Now it's time for bed.

410
00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.680
Dad?

411
00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120
Mhm.

412
00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.400
What is that?

413
00:43:10.600 --> 00:43:12.600
What is it, my little angel?

414
00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:39.880
August?!
