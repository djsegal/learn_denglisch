00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
.

2
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.120
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.560
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.200
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.280
Moin.

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.320
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

7
00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.880
Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann,
63 years old,

8
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.000
former First Mayoress
of Düsseldorf,

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:32.720
Member of the Bundestag of the FDP,
since 2017 in the party executive

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.880
and the coolest sock of the FDP.

11
00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.520
Mrs. Strack-Zimmermann?
Yes?

12
00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.080
Who still writes
"cool sock"?

13
00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.280
Yes, you did read it out.

14
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.840
No, we have that
somewhere from the WORLD.

15
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
The press
calls you the "coolest sock".

16
00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.760
Yes, there you see,
what's in store for you.

17
00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.520
May I also say:
saucy sumse?

18
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.440
Saucy sum sounds a bit
a bit vulgar, but it's okay.

19
00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.000
But it's the same saying as "cool sock".
as "cool sock".

20
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.880
May I have a
conduct a quirky interview?

21
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.640
Yes, with pleasure. Now, come on,
I'm getting impatient.

22
00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.040
I am a little afraid, I am
very shy. Did you know that?

23
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.240
Yes, yes, I was told,
that you are very sensitive.

24
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.720
"Jaja" means
"kiss my ass" in Berlin.

25
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.920
(laughs) Yes, exactly.
I love you.

26
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.560
* Krömer laughs. *

27
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.840
It's off to a good start. I am glad.
I'm coming in now.

28
00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.040
So, good day. - Hello.
Do you have something to drink?

29
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.200
Yes. - Many have complained.
That's right, I was just thinking the same thing.

30
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.440
I thought there was more.
Do we have the disc? No.

31
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.120
We are vaccinated.
Mhm.

32
00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.200
Already on the way
To the third vaccination.

33
00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.480
Yes, boosters.
When is your turn?

34
00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.560
I have
booster sometime in December.

35
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.080
Can I call my family doctor
and make an appointment already?

36
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.000
I can also introduce you to
my gynecologist.

37
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.120
She'll do it. - Sure. Where is she?

38
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.000
She is nice, good looking
and is in Düsseldorf.

39
00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.320
Well, Düsseldorf is a bit far,
but I'm on the road a lot.

40
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.080
Once a boost at the gynecologist
by Mrs. Strack-Zimmermann.

41
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.760
You are considered the coolest sock,
we got that from the WORLD or something.

42
00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.000
Is it still possible to be cool at 63?
that you're cool?

43
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.840
That's an interesting question. - Yes.
Be a little charming.

44
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.160
No, but tell me now ...
Yes, you can.

45
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.120
Is that a cheeky question?
No. - An appropriate one?

46
00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.920
No, a totally stupid question.
Next.

47
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.560
No.
Okay.

48
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.600
Well, if I were 63,
I would of course say: cool.

49
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:39.760
63 is the new cool.
Yes, it's okay, a good age.

50
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.560
My grandmother was 99, the
other 94, my mother was 94.

51
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.920
There is still room for improvement.
Yes, okay.

52
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.440
Was that a bad start?
No.

53
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.960
Shall we cut already?
Yes, come back in.

54
00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.240
Nice to meet you!
Hello!

55
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.960
And, have you been vaccinated?
You are 63 years old.

56
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.400
You are a cool sock.
There you go.

57
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.560
Should we put it in like this
or leave both in?

58
00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.200
No, we only do those.
You have already seen the show.

59
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.080
You like to ride your motorcycle, polish
it lovingly and go on tours.

60
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.040
The polishing thing ...
Yes, that's cool.

61
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.600
This is the motorcycle, yes?
Yes, my motorcycle and me.

62
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.480
But the polishing ...
Shall I be honest?

63
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.680
I am interested: Can you make the
carbon neutral by 2030? - No.

64
00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.440
Are you throwing away or what? - No,
that's so old, it keeps running.

65
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.880
When we all
ring in climate change?

66
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.640
Or is that already running
on batteries? - No.

67
00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.360
Yes, it has a battery,
would otherwise be bad.

68
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.960
No, this is a gasoline engine.

69
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.160
When you step on the gas,
it's loud, smelly.

70
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.720
But we want to become climate-neutral
from 2030. - Yes, all of them.

71
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.760
And are you still driving that thing?
Do I have to go along with it?

72
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.440
Can you turn off the mic?
We don't have any mics on at all.

73
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.440
I see. - This is the preliminary interview.
That's a zero, under three.

74
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.920
Then we go to broadcast hall A
and record. - Exactly.

75
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.360
So far, you can say anything.

76
00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.800
This is vintage '98,
so the motorcycle. - Yes.

77
00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:14.800
I don't think that counts,
I don't think that counts.

78
00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.600
I don't have to ride an e-motorcycle now
now, do I? - I will from 2030.

79
00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.400
Is that so?
How old am I then?

80
00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.480
You are a politician,
or am I mistaken? - Yes.

81
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.800
You are with the FDP, aren't you?
Yes, with the FDP.

82
00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Is that how you talk to the Greens in the coalition talks?
coalition talks: "No!"?

83
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.640
No. - "I'll ride my motorcycle
I don't give a shit!"

84
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.560
A real politician,
now we gender first, says,

85
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.400
the whole world can do that, but
I will continue to drive my gasoline engine.

86
00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.560
So, besides your motorcycle you love
your car and like to ski.

87
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.440
Do you have
any climate-neutral hobby?

88
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:55.200
Yes, I drive the car less often.

89
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.960
A climate-neutral hobby?

90
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.840
I do not like to ride
long bicycle routes.

91
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.600
But if that is correct now,
I ride a bike.

92
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.920
Because a bicycle
does not run on gasoline?

93
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.600
Yes, it doesn't make the sound.
We can say that:

94
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.480
Agnes Strack-Zimmermann
does not matter at all what 2030 is?

95
00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.280
"I'll keep on rolling."
Yeah, I so don't care.

96
00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.160
I am now ...
What do we have now, 2021? - Yes.

97
00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.040
Yes, in nine years.
I ride a motorcycle, this motorcycle.

98
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.920
Promise me,
that you will put the 2030 into the ...

99
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.520
In the garbage can? - Biodegradable waste garbage can,
not plastic and paper ...

100
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.560
No, this is not
plastic and paper,

101
00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.040
you still have something
in the hands.

102
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.800
Are you ready?

103
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.320
You leave me no choice. I'm listening.
You're done. - Yes.

104
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.680
I am often accused
that I don't let people finish.

105
00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.520
No, I'm impressed.

106
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.640
I firmly resolve to let the guest,
to let the guest speak.

107
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.160
The guest, please
please don't. I am the guest.

108
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.840
You don't gender?
No, I don't gender.

109
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.560
I do not gender that I say,
They are politicians ...

110
00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.800
With this hiccup. - Where you
think you have the hiccups.

111
00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:15.280
But I would say
say politicians.

112
00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.360
That's okay, but not this ...
What did I just say? Guest.

113
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.600
Ah, that's tough.
We have guests, too. - Yes?

114
00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.840
I have bike racks in front of the door
and bike rack gutters, okay.

115
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:32.040
I also have gutters on the roof,
but I have not yet had guests.

116
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.240
Your birth name is
Marie-Agnes Jahn. - Exactly.

117
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.120
Why didn't you keep that one?
I thought three names was excessive.

118
00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:42.240
I have married a
Mr. Strack-Zimmermann married.

119
00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:46.120
You will laugh, when I
got married, the registrar,

120
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.800
it was really one,
to the great surprise,

121
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.000
asked me if I wanted to
wanted to put the Jahn on the back burner.

122
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.640
* artificial laughter *
Yes, so did I ...

123
00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.080
You said yes, "You will laugh."
Yes, that was my reaction.

124
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.280
They didn't find that funny at all.

125
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.520
You grew up with two older
brothers.

126
00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.880
They taught you
how to stand up to boys.

127
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.360
How often have you had Christian Lindner
in a headlock?

128
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.600
How many times? Once.

129
00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.640
Yes? - Mhm.
What was it about?

130
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:23.440
When we thought about it in 2013, when
the shit really hit the fan ...

131
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.000
This is fecal language.

132
00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.080
Sorry,
but fecal language also sucks.

133
00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.000
I find,
that fits into the interior.

134
00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.960
From Mr. Mielke.
I thought it was good.

135
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.640
You have
a refrigerator from Bauknecht.

136
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.640
"Bauknecht knows what women
want." Total chauvinist act.

137
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.400
Do you know them?
No, you are too young.

138
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:49.560
Now you have exposed me as a misogynist
and also made publicity.

139
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.840
Bauknecht knows what women want.
That was the advertising. Crass, isn't it?

140
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.520
Let's throw out.
You asked something else.

141
00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.560
Yes, speaking of advertising:

142
00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:01.040
There is
a new campaign from Treets.

143
00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.480
Yes.
These are such sweets.

144
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.480
I stole those once.
Yes.

145
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.280
Well, tell me! - Yes.
That would be a question.

146
00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.640
I was
in the supermarket when I was seven.

147
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.800
How old? Seven years ago?

148
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.160
No, that would be embarrassing.

149
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.440
The story is supposed to be nice.
I was seven years old.

150
00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:23.440
I stole a bag of Treets,
from the Zickuhr family.

151
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.280
Zinc clock?
Zickuhr, a small supermarket.

152
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:30.240
I ran out,
told a friend, "I got it."

153
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.680
Was stupid,
they were still behind me.

154
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.720
Oh God, you couldn't
not eat it up. - No.

155
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.400
I ran, she caught up with me
at the school gate and said:

156
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.720
"Should I tell the teacher
or directly to your parents?"

157
00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:44.760
I said, "Directly to my parents."

158
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.160
because I thought the teacher
will also tell my parents.

159
00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:52.080
I knew then that I was
I was in good hands in politics.

160
00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.360
Do you still steal today?
No, I'm clumsy in that respect.

161
00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.240
I once stole from Bilka.
The store no longer exists.

162
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.280
And what?
Chapstick. - Chapstick?

163
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.280
Labello Strawberry, for a friend,
with whom I wanted to get together.

164
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.920
She only took the chapstick.

165
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:09.400
You could not kiss them,
to look,

166
00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:11.160
whether it tastes like strawberry?

167
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:14.120
I would say,
she took advantage of me. - Mean.

168
00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.880
And on this criminal way.
I could not eat the treets.

169
00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.560
For me, it was seven years ago.
Yes, you see?

170
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.880
But everyone has a shot free.

171
00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:28.000
So, you were 20 years,
here it comes, at the Tessloff publishing house.

172
00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.680
Yes.
"What's what?"

173
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.080
What were you there?
Super.

174
00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.160
So, what was what?
What, how, what, how was the ... what?

175
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.920
I worked there in sales,
in North Rhine-Westphalia,

176
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:43.800
and ensured that many "What
is what?" come into bookstores.

177
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.560
Great that you know it right away.
You were ...

178
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.400
Of course,
"What is what - Dinosaurs".

179
00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.240
Band number?
One.

180
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.040
Wrong.
What?

181
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.240
Volume number 15 is Dinosaur.
What was number one?

182
00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.280
The earth.
The earth.

183
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:02.600
"What's What?" ...
You were a representative? - Yes, exactly.

184
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.200
Have you ever stolen a book?
No, but you will laugh.

185
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.320
At the book fair
books were exhibited

186
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.600
and after three days they were all gone.

187
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.840
There all the people stole,
according to the motto:

188
00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.400
"The books are just sitting there,
I can take one with me." - Exactly.

189
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:22.120
At some point someone said,
that's a big misunderstanding.

190
00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.760
The treets were also just lying around,
you can steal them. - That's how it is.

191
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:30.480
What does it mean to steal, to take?
It was the same with the books.

192
00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.040
At some point we
only put down empty sleeves.

193
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:37.000
You joined the
joined the FDP.

194
00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:40.680
Didn't you earn enough before
earned enough, or why? - Yes, I did.

195
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.760
This is a wrong thought.

196
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.640
Because I earned so much,
I joined the FDP. - I see.

197
00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:49.920
Only rich people join the FDP.
Didn't you know that?

198
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.360
Have you already
filled out an application?

199
00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.200
I'm not that rich yet. - Yes, you are.
I have been trying for years.

200
00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:00.960
"No, we checked the bank statement
checked." - Junior Program.

201
00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.760
What did you just say?
Junior program.

202
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:06.200
I thought senior program.
No.

203
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.800
You started with politics
and one thing connects us.

204
00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.120
You live in Düsseldorf,
I in Berlin.

205
00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:15.240
But we had the same problem.

206
00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:16.880
You went into politics

207
00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:20.320
because of a crosswalk
in front of your children's daycare center. - Exactly.

208
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.120
I have in the district,
where I live, a traffic circle

209
00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:26.640
and exactly the same story.

210
00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:31.880
The district has waited 39 years
with this crosswalk.

211
00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.240
So, did you make it?
How old is your child now?

212
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.160
35.
35.

213
00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:41.200
Does it run, does it talk? Does it walk alone
across the crosswalk?

214
00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.720
Yes, the child is walking.
It walks and talks?

215
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.160
Yes, it breathes,
walks and talks,

216
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:49.080
but the crosswalk
never came.

217
00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.560
No? - No, then the whole
the whole kindergarten was moved.

218
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.560
This was not my idea.

219
00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:58.360
At a point where there was a crosswalk
was the daycare center built? - Yes.

220
00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.480
So mountain, prophet, prophet, mountain.
That is how it is.

221
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:05.240
We have in this district ...
I will be 47 years old this year.

222
00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:08.360
They have waited almost 40 years
waiting for this. - Exactly.

223
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.080
With us you always went
with several children

224
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.560
across a busy road.

225
00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.840
But the crosswalk never came.

226
00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.920
I already knew then,
politics would be tough.

227
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.640
40 years ago
the Green Party was founded

228
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:27.440
And started saying:
"Nuclear power plants? No, thanks."

229
00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.800
40 years later: bam.
Lights out, end. - Yes.

230
00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.240
Does everything always take
always take so long?

231
00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.480
Climate change, for example, comes the ...
We are already in the middle of it.

232
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:41.000
Not you yet. We can
talk about the motorcycle again.

233
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.440
I see, climate change,
not climacteric.

234
00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.360
I've already been through that.
Don't throw in jokes now.

235
00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:50.240
I am a comedian,
I have no sense of humor.

236
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.320
Do we now have to wait 40 years
until everything is climate-neutral?

237
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.520
No, faster.

238
00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.040
You did talk about 2030,

239
00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:03.160
when my poor motorcycle
is no longer allowed out of the garage.

240
00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.120
Are you shitting me?
No.

241
00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:09.160
Tips now and then that I don't
because I'm excited?

242
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:12.640
I am afraid of you because you are
are quite snippy.

243
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.560
You say what you think.
Dangerous. - Yes, true.

244
00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.880
You are an anarchist clown.
Yes, a little bit.

245
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.720
My teachers
my teachers didn't like that either.

246
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.920
Lindner brought you onto the
brought you onto the Federal Executive Board,

247
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.560
to renew the party.

248
00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:31.160
You were 55 at the time.
not rejuvenate. - Now be careful.

249
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.280
Careful what you say.
Yes.

250
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.200
Still good up to here, though, right?
Yes.

251
00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.400
Are you the breath of fresh air,
the store needs?

252
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.240
Yes, I was the breath of fresh air.

253
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.560
Is that actually hostile to the elderly,
what I am doing?

254
00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:46.800
Listen, you are
an old chauvinist, with Bauknecht...

255
00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:49.800
I am not a chauvinist,
I must reject that.

256
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:55.120
I did not know that,
this Bauknecht flies out.

257
00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.600
No, that was a build-up.

258
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.800
That was so to speak
the debris woman of the 21st century.

259
00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.320
Today we have a breath of fresh air.

260
00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.200
My editor used to say:
"Irony doesn't work on TV."

261
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:12.400
No, that doesn't work,
not even in politics.

262
00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.840
But I thought,
where we are alone ...

263
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.720
Why am I sympathetic to you, but
with the FDP? There's something wrong there.

264
00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.760
Konstantin Kuhle
was also sympathetic to me.

265
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.680
Yeah, he's a cool guy, isn't he?
That was a play on words.

266
00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:28.400
But you tortured him.
5 marks, uh 5 euros ...

267
00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:32.240
You are in the wrong party.
They are sympathetic, like Kuhle.

268
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.040
Likeable, but with the FDP.
We have super cool people.

269
00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:39.440
Is everyone wrong with you?
No, all cool.

270
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:41.960
Did everyone make a wrong turn?
All cool.

271
00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.680
There was a door open, door
closed again, bam you're in the FDP.

272
00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.240
Yes, something like that.

273
00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.840
My body rejects that I say
say you are nice and funny,

274
00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:55.160
but with the FDP.

275
00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.280
Your body repels me?
No, this FDP thing.

276
00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:03.040
That I say you come
from the FDP and are sympathetic.

277
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.560
This repels my body.
Your body rejects that?

278
00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.200
Like then
Mrs. Merkel with the refugees,

279
00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:12.360
where I thought: Not bad at all
bad, makes them good.

280
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.880
She did a good job.
Then I asked myself:

281
00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.920
Did I just say that
about a woman from the CDU?

282
00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.880
What do you choose? Green?
You choose green. - No, no.

283
00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.160
Go through all the parties,
I say no everywhere.

284
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.160
Is that so?
Don't you vote at all? - Yes, I do.

285
00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:32.280
But I would never
say publicly what I choose.

286
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.840
I would always say: go vote,
it's important, but secret. - Yes.

287
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.080
Not that I then have to
I have to take responsibility for some store.

288
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:47.160
"You're with the FDP, too!"
I also never say what I vote for.

289
00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.800
When people ask me what I voted
I say, "I don't."

290
00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.960
You have to fold it over,
that you do not see it.

291
00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.760
This came on a comedy show.

292
00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:59.760
That was Mr. Laschet.
Laschet was the name of the comedian.

293
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.280
He did that on purpose.
You can't bend it like that at all.

294
00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:08.040
There's a fold.
He folded it like a folding map.

295
00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.600
Do you know what a folding plan was?
Are we laughing at Laschet now?

296
00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.480
No, about the folding plan.
It's actually sad.

297
00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:18.240
One would have to
make a commitment in Germany,

298
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:21.720
about Mr. Laschet for the next
40 years to talk no more.

299
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:26.560
I must say, I find,
that was always a good colleague.

300
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.080
Not from me, but I know him
from North Rhine-Westphalia.

301
00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:34.600
He had a colleague in Mr. Söder
colleague who gave him the knife ...

302
00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.280
You have to say that now, sure,
because there's a camera running.

303
00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.560
M-m, no, is so.

304
00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.680
You are the defense policy
Spokesperson of the FDP.

305
00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.240
Do you like
for uniforms and heavy equipment?

306
00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:50.640
I find that borderline,
if I may say so.

307
00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:54.800
* Strack-Zimmermann laughs. *
What is borderline there now?

308
00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:00.120
Cool, isn't it? That was in the Tornado,
I had to fly it.

309
00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.920
Like ... - I wanted to land in Düsseldorf
and came out in Cologne-Bonn.

310
00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.720
(laughs artificially) Was that
the moment to laugh again?

311
00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:10.320
I'll tell you this.
I'm laughing my ass off.

312
00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:16.520
There you are sitting in a simulator.
Was that in the air? - No.

313
00:17:16.680 --> 00:17:20.320
Do you, to look better,
open the window in the air?

314
00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:23.880
It was a simulator!
Did you yell at me? - Yes.

315
00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.840
I am afterwards
into a Eurofighter

316
00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.280
and that was
much easier to land.

317
00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.240
Dress up there
dress up for the troops

318
00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.560
or are they carnival costumes?

319
00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:37.960
No, at carnival
I wear other things.

320
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:42.080
(sighs) You have
the Defense Commissioner of the Bundestag,

321
00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:46.120
Eva Högl of the SPD, criticized.
Now comes the mouse milking.

322
00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.440
"She has no expertise
in matters concerning the Bundeswehr

323
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.640
and also no interest
shown in this topic."

324
00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.320
The Bundeswehr needs someone
who is passionate about what they do,

325
00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:59.720
deeply rooted in the matter.
What was that all about?

326
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:02.040
I was surprised.
* Krömer claps. *

327
00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:06.080
I appreciate them very much, small
written. - You have to say that.

328
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.440
No, no. - What did you
lowercase? - "You".

329
00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.480
I hold Mrs. Högl in very high regard.
Yes, you too. - The Höglin.

330
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.760
I was a little surprised,

331
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:18.800
because her predecessor was really
was a great defense commissioner.

332
00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:23.680
When the was no longer set up
and Mrs. Högl was selected,

333
00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:27.600
I was surprised, because she had
had nothing to do with the subject.

334
00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:31.280
Let's talk about war.
You mean apropos?

335
00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:34.120
How do you explain to children,
why killing is necessary?

336
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.760
No, killing is not necessary.
But that's what happens in war.

337
00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:39.960
You have to be able to defend yourself.

338
00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.240
You have to explain that relatively early on.

339
00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.760
If you want to live free
and live in peace

340
00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.960
and others
dispute this,

341
00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.440
you have to be ready
to be defensible.

342
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.520
But you also kill people in the process.
That can happen.

343
00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:56.320
That would be the saddest thing.

344
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.360
That would be the explanation,
if my children ask me:

345
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:02.080
"Why do you kill people in war?"
No.

346
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:05.320
You would have to explain to your children
first explain what war is

347
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:09.680
and whether it is worth defending values
to defend. A difficult question.

348
00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:12.280
I now have grandchildren

349
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.440
and also always think,
how to explain it today.

350
00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:18.640
I have
not yet understood it that way,

351
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.320
that I would
would pass it on to my children.

352
00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.760
Yeah, listen.
What are you, 47?

353
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.720
I am 46, Mrs. Strack-Zimmermann.
46, okay good.

354
00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.360
So ...
Late 40s.

355
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.560
Suppose you are at home
and one invades your house.

356
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.600
Yes, then I shoot the dead.

357
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.680
Because we are at war.
No, no. Now...

358
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.560
I would have recommended
recommended the garden hose.

359
00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.280
Maybe with water.
After all, this is not a war.

360
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.240
You need to explain to children,

361
00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.920
that one must not
must not be allowed to cross.

362
00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:52.120
Now that's thinking big.
No one wants war.

363
00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:55.960
On the street, everyone says no.
That's just as well.

364
00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.800
I am a conscientious objector.
I thought so.

365
00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.920
I was...
Why, is there something behind me?

366
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:06.720
That's what I thought.
But I was also in Afghanistan.

367
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.840
You are 46? - I am 46.
Didn't you have to serve?

368
00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:13.480
(sighs) Yes, yes,
I was born in West Berlin.

369
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:16.120
The wall came down in '89,
I was 16, 17.

370
00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:18.960
Oh, the Berliners didn't have to.
Not before.

371
00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.560
Not before the fall of the Wall,
afterwards it was.

372
00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:25.880
Then I said, bye-bye Nikowski.
"I always have back and knees"?

373
00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:30.040
No, at that time I played
the Ufa factory in Berlin,

374
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:33.280
have done children's theater,
variety events.

375
00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:36.120
I was cleaning,
I was dishwasher, said:

376
00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:41.800
Because of the shitty work instead
Go to community service instead? No.

377
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.640
But because I do not understand the war,
as it is, I do not understand it.

378
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.320
I do not want to be part.

379
00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:50.360
So you did community service?
No, nothing at all.

380
00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.080
Passport taken, thrown away,
Closing time. - And then?

381
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.600
Then eleven years ago
in Afghanistan, Masar-e Sharif,

382
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.800
Made troop support and asked:

383
00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.800
"Guys,
you know my story.

384
00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.760
Why are you inviting me?"
"We think you're funny."

385
00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:08.160
Then I said...
You were really there?

386
00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:12.000
Yes, I was there. Mazar-e Sharif,
Kabul, once with the Bundeswehr.

387
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.800
On the second trip,
there is a book about it,

388
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.680
I was in the civilian part in Kabul.

389
00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.720
And you talked to the soldiers?
Yes. - And?

390
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:23.560
I stood up for the soldiers
for the soldiers. I did not understand.

391
00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.080
If you wanted to fly
wanted to fly to Kabul,

392
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:29.040
in Cologne-Bonn we boarded the
into the Bundeswehr aircraft.

393
00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.280
In front of me was a young man,
maybe 20, had a backpack.

394
00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.120
A Diddl mouse was peeking out.
Mmm. Interesting what you say.

395
00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:38.880
I have it...
* (groans)

396
00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.560
Interesting what you say.
I have these conversations too.

397
00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:44.440
And with this Diddl mouse ...

398
00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:47.880
We flew from Mazar-e Sharif
to Kabul

399
00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.200
with a helicopter,
a Chinook of the Americans.

400
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.240
We are with the Transall ...

401
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.280
There were young soldiers, Americans,
who secured it,

402
00:21:57.440 --> 00:21:59.600
they flew very low over Kabul.

403
00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.440
It was the same there,
They were very young, those guys,

404
00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.560
and also had a backpack on,

405
00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:08.360
where such an animal was on it,
a mascot.

406
00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.440
That's when I thought: That's really cool.
It had something childlike about it.

407
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:18.640
But this was a war-like....
a dangerous situation.

408
00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.000
What did they tell you,
why they chose this profession?

409
00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.040
I remember,
that you only tapped people

410
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.840
And asked, "How are you?"

411
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.120
Then came a 1.5-hour monologue,

412
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.080
where you thought:
Whoa, you guys need to talk.

413
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.400
The fact was that all the soldiers ...

414
00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.040
You are not interested
do not care or say,

415
00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.040
when a traumatized soldier
comes back:

416
00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:46.640
"Well, you could have
could have known beforehand.

417
00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.880
Of course, get away from me
with your disgusting story."

418
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.560
When I was there ...

419
00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:57.160
I wasn't afraid for my life,
more for this 22-year-old,

420
00:22:57.320 --> 00:22:59.520
which I would still have protected,
I think,

421
00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.320
if people had thrown bombs
would have thrown bombs into this camp.

422
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:04.080
I did not understand it.

423
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:10.840
I also think it would be difficult to become a soldier,
I also imagine that it would be difficult.

424
00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.480
Taking that step.

425
00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.280
In the 90s
there were very many professional soldiers,

426
00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:21.480
or in the 80s, which ultimately
did not have to go into action.

427
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.520
They could join the Bundeswehr,
but never had to worry,

428
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.560
really have to go into action.

429
00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:30.760
That has changed,
who joins the Bundeswehr today,

430
00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.040
who must assume.

431
00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:35.720
Nevertheless, many young
many young people.

432
00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:39.440
Maybe it's abstract.
I'm about to cry.

433
00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:41.680
No, you don't have to.
Yes you do.

434
00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.960
But I find ...
No, this is not a joke.

435
00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:49.040
I do not understand.
You ask me...

436
00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.680
I'm about to cry.
But you respect it?

437
00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:55.200
I respect it, just as
as I respect police officers,

438
00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:59.080
that 30 or 20 years ago
I did not respect so much.

439
00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.720
This is the example.

440
00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.400
When the burglar is standing in front of
is standing in front of my children's room,

441
00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:07.320
of course I call the police.

442
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.520
They are happy when they come.
That's it. - That's it.

443
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.800
You do not have to,
what one comprehends ...

444
00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.840
You say you're calling the police,
so that they can help you.

445
00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.040
That's not why you want to
to take up this profession.

446
00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.280
I have enormous respect
for these soldiers,

447
00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.960
because they protect us in the end

448
00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.640
in an emergency,
which hopefully will never come.

449
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.440
I'm kind of ...

450
00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.880
I am touched by this conversation.
How are you?

451
00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.560
I am ... - I know
always not with you politicians.

452
00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:45.760
If I were Mrs. Maischberger,
would you be the same?

453
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.200
I don't want to
negative or anything.

454
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:53.000
I have the feeling with politicians
a cassette is being rewound.

455
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.920
No, there are none in the subject.

456
00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:59.160
But that is part
part of defense policy.

457
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.120
I have visited many soldiers
in the missions,

458
00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.040
the question is very legitimate.

459
00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:07.760
This is not a cassette, but
you deal with it.

460
00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.240
We can also talk about wolves,
but I... - In Brandenburg?

461
00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.840
Yes, wherever.
Or foxes in Berlin.

462
00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.360
I have a colleague
who would tell you a lot about this,

463
00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.400
I would be completely overwhelmed.
We are above the time.

464
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.680
And the coalition negotiations?
Is there any news? - No.

465
00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.600
That was all? Can you not
pierce something already?

466
00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.360
Isn't that what you do when you say
say that we have achieved one thing?

467
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:37.040
No.
It's good, it's going.

468
00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.560
We are nice to each other.
Peace, joy, pancakes.

469
00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.480
The next 40 years?
You don't get anything.

470
00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.440
No, we don't want to exaggerate.
Look, I'm 63.

471
00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:50.920
Should I be pushed with 103 over the gutter
at the Reichstag?

472
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:56.040
Well, if it continues like this,
it will be for the 103rd birthday

473
00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:59.240
still be called:
"We don't want to tell too much."

474
00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:01.440
No, but it's on.

475
00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.280
It runs ...
polite, correct and okay.

476
00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.280
Okay. Good.

477
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.480
Yes, I am surprised myself.
Cheers. - Cheers.

478
00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:13.920
I would not have thought,

479
00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.920
that I once
with an FDP politician.

480
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.520
For me
the conversation was confusing. - Yes?

481
00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:22.720
Yes, I'm not a journalist.
I'm sitting here as a ...

482
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.600
Thank you for making me ...
Funny actor I am.

483
00:26:26.760 --> 00:26:29.640
... that I can still confuse such a young man
can still confuse.

484
00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:33.920
Do I get then
without a camera?

485
00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.560
No, no, for God's sake.

486
00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.760
I have a great husband,
had a great father,

487
00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:41.960
have wonderful sons,
I am a ...

488
00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:46.400
Men's ... rin.
Understander, yes.

489
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.320
So, we won't talk about smoking pot.

490
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.440
Smoking pot is of no interest to me,
comes 30 years too late.

491
00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.680
I have in the 70s ...
Granu Fink for all.

492
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.880
But smoking pot comes too late.

493
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:01.440
But your children?
What should I tell them?

494
00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:04.320
Should they smoke pot?
They already do that.

495
00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.200
How old are they?
Not yet of age.

496
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.800
As if that were a reason. - Should I build
build them a bag for their 18th?

497
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.360
I'll come by with a bag.
By then the legalized.

498
00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.520
The bag? - The bag.
The one you sell to my children?

499
00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.600
You sell drugs to my children?
I give.

500
00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:25.720
Oh, you give the drugs. - Yes.
What a nice ending.

501
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.600
Mrs. Strack-Zimmermann

502
00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.520
gives my children for their
Cannabis for free for their coming of age.

503
00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:35.560
So, that's it.
Unfortunately, the 35 minutes are already up.

504
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.720
Yes, it was very substantial after all.

505
00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.280
Do you get a ministry?
No, otherwise you wouldn't be here.

506
00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:45.120
That's right. Whoever comes in here...
Is lost. Come with me.

507
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.640
There's nothing going on anymore.
Is so.

508
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.840
Minister of Defense would be
actually fitting, wouldn't it? - No.

509
00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:57.840
Please go over there, you are not
not Mrs. Krömer, not yet.

510
00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.400
So, Mrs. Strack-Zimmermann.
Everything is in order here. - Yes.

511
00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.920
I realize. - Public
legal, we are the good guys.

512
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:09.480
Um... Yes, that's it. - Yeah.
So no ministry?

513
00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:13.080
No, the accolade was today.
Minister for Environmental Protection?

514
00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:15.560
"All motorcycles in the garbage can!"?
Nothing?

515
00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.680
I think about it.
She thinks about it.

516
00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:24.080
We'll be in touch,
if we can rejuvenate anything.

517
00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.240
Thank you.
Thank you also.

518
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:28.160
* Title music *

519
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.440
Come along.
