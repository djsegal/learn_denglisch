1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.800
So far on "Babylon Berlin" ...

3
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.400
What do you know about the gold?
I know nothing.

4
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.600
I know nothing! Please don't!

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.720
Please don't go back into the cold!
Please don't!

6
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.400
((Jänicke) Several times
the word "pillory day" is used

7
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.960
for a secret operation).

8
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.520
We show the members
of the General Staff of the Reichswehr.

9
00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.400
The "Black Reichswehr"
is the greatest threat

10
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.240
of peace in Europe since 1918.

11
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.000
Major General Seegers?
You are under arrest.

12
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.560
We have clues,

13
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.960
that this organization
in the coming days

14
00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.960
is preparing a coup.

15
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.760
What is that, Mr. Wolter?
An M/28?

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.320
This is something very special.
We are making history with this.

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.200
Long live the emperor!
- Long live the emperor!

18
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.240
So then:
"Operation Pillory Day".

19
00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.360
I am on the verge,
15 high-ranking officers

20
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.760
from custody
from custody.

21
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.400
You are messing with the state
with the state itself.

22
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.720
Mr. Rath!

23
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.400
I found this
under your bed.

24
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.320
Fritz!
- Gretchen!

25
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.120
Leave me alone!
- We were ratted out.

26
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.600
Gretchen, run!

27
00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.000
*shot*

28
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.480
Fritz!
They shot at him!

29
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.440
And remember:

30
00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.800
This is just an engineer,
not a military man.

31
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.400
That one?

32
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.440
M-m.

33
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.480
If you are too hard on him,

34
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.000
he crawls away, shoo, shoo
back into his snail shell.

35
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.360
That's him now.

36
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.840
*Shots, screams

37
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.800
*excited babble of voices*

38
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.760
*Honk*

39
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.640
*uncanny music

40
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.760
*rhythmic music

41
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.800
We had no chance.

42
00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.880
The car was so
disappeared so quickly,

43
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.720
as he had appeared.

44
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.000
And the man dead on the spot.

45
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.800
We will investigate this.

46
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.560
Good morning everyone.

47
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.600
That's how quickly you see each other again,
Seegers.

48
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.240
Not the most desirable kind,
of a reunion,

49
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.320
but service is service.

50
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.240
You sit on the advisory board
of the Nyssen Foundation.

51
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.560
What are your tasks there?

52
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.840
First and foremost the care
and the preservation of war memorials

53
00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.440
and of course the care
of officers' widows.

54
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.240
They are therefore closely
with the Nyssen Group.

55
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.840
Yes, you can say that.

56
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.440
Therefore covers Alfred Nyssen
as a straw man

57
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.600
for the Reichswehr
illegal arms imports?

58
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.760
Who do you want to impress?

59
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.720
Answer my question.
Is Nyssen your front man?

60
00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.680
I've already said it. No.

61
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.640
However, Nyssen is the principal
for deliveries of goods,

62
00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.840
for which he himself
can have no use for.

63
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.400
In contrast to the Reichswehr.

64
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:21.960
Especially your vision of it.
Poison gas.

65
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.360
Vision? Isn't that something
for novelists or the mentally ill?

66
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.400
But perhaps
you mean responsibility.

67
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.240
*There's a knock.
What is it?

68
00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.720
I have here the revocation
of the arrest warrant

69
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.320
against all
persons in custody

70
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.800
Ranks
of the German Reichswehr

71
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.600
in the "Lipetsk and other matters" case.

72
00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.600
Who decided that?

73
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.280
Highest authority?

74
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:52.520
The gentlemen
are to be released immediately.

75
00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.240
Mr. Major General,
do you know this document?

76
00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.400
The confirmation of an order
Pesticides from the Soviet Union.

77
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.800
However, these wagons contain
green cross according to the analysis.

78
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.440
Green cross?

79
00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.480
(Benda) This is the code name
for lung warfare agents.

80
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.320
Phosgene, diphosgene.

81
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.360
I see your signature there,
Major General.

82
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.280
Or am I mistaken?

83
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.240
That's incredible.

84
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.640
That's not possible.

85
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.960
Where did you find this?

86
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.640
That literally
literally flew to me.

87
00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.920
With this we go
to the public.

88
00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.560
See you in Zörgiebel's office
in ten minutes.

89
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.800
See you soon. And?

90
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.560
Nothing.
That doesn't even exist!

91
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.920
And what does the family say?
No one is surprised.

92
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.760
She often
not come home at night.

93
00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.720
She had a clear mission.
She doesn't disappear.

94
00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.960
What about you?

95
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.520
In all the places I know of,
that they are known,

96
00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.760
she has not been seen.

97
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880
Thank you.

98
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:13.520
*Gate opens.

99
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.960
*exciting music*

100
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.800
Hh!

101
00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.760
Our cuisine is notorious
for its variety.

102
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.480
You now have a choice,

103
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.960
to this reputation
to make a special contribution

104
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.600
or to cooperate.

105
00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.320
(quietly) Cooperate.

106
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.960
Nothing understood.

107
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.800
I cooperate.

108
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.640
Excellent.

109
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.880
Tomorrow morning, eight o'clock,
Press conference.

110
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.280
Tabula rasa.

111
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:09.680
Thank you, Miss Ackers.

112
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.400
Good work, gentlemen.

113
00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.400
A little luck
is sometimes part of it.

114
00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.680
*exciting music*

115
00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:38.920
(Yes?

116
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:42.400
I would like to
to speak to the President of the Reich.

117
00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.720
I connect.
- Thank you.

118
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.360
*He whistles
"The Moritat of Mackie Messer".

119
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.520
What is it?

120
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.400
I have to go.

121
00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.640
Yes ...

122
00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.400
Does it still hurt?

123
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.600
I've been really lucky
with you.

124
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.840
No.

125
00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.280
Yes, it is.

126
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.880
Yes, I have.

127
00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.640
Definitely, Emmi.

128
00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:20.680
So, duty calls.

129
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:23.920
See you tonight!

130
00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.880
See you tonight.

131
00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.440
*He knocks.

132
00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.960
Boss says,
You should change the application.

133
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.840
From oral to intravenous.

134
00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.480
Where is Mr. Döhmann?
Uh ... gone.

135
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.320
I see.

136
00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.240
Do you know how it works?

137
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.560
No, but my wife. Thank you.

138
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.400
Well, tell me.

139
00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:44.160
That's what they gave me
at the hospital.

140
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.520
He didn't make it.

141
00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.120
The pigs got him.

142
00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.200
That was the political police,
Greta.

143
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.840
Your Benda here.

144
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:03.320
*She sobs.

145
00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.520
What?

146
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.680
The Jewish sow ordered it.

147
00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.600
*She breathes shakily.

148
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.760
The guys who shot Fritz
were his people.

149
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.760
Tell me what you want me to do,
and I'll do it.

150
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000
No matter what.

151
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.000
*exciting music*

152
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.440
We will be in touch.

153
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.560
*exciting music*

154
00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.160
So ...

155
00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.680
Tighten, fist.

156
00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.880
Look.

157
00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.200
It was over ten years ago.

158
00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.920
I could start tomorrow
start at the hospital tomorrow.

159
00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:33.160
Apply gauze, bend up.

160
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.480
Quite simply.

161
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.880
*He exhales deeply.

162
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.560
Thank you.

163
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.800
*exciting music*

164
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.400
*exciting music*

165
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.000
*exciting music*

166
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:52.360
Stop! Badge!

167
00:13:57.960 --> 00:13:58.960
Pass!

168
00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.800
*He whistles
"The Moritat of Mackie Messer".

169
00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.440
Schibulski, Eleventh Precinct.

170
00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.200
*driving, ticking music*

171
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.560
*removed voices*

172
00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:59.800
*driving, ticking music*

173
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.640
*quiet music

174
00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:43.800
(Helga) I thought that was exaggerated,
a room with a radio.

175
00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.440
But now, quite good.

176
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.120
Listen,
how the districts sound here:

177
00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:50.480
Schöneberg - beautiful.

178
00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.520
Charlottenburg ...

179
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.760
If you had become a girl,
your name would be Charlotte.

180
00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.960
(Moritz) But I'm not.
- Gereon.

181
00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.800
There you are again.

182
00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.240
Tempelhof ...
What do you think Tempelhof sounds like?

183
00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.120
Please bear with me.

184
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.680
This is powerful stuff.

185
00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.880
Yes.
You must have been gone for an hour.

186
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.400
Really?

187
00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.840
*whistles*

188
00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:22.560
(Radio) Now listen to
a commentary

189
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.840
on the visit
of the French Foreign Minister.

190
00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:28.560
What are you whistling?
Mackie Messer.

191
00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.680
And where did you get that from?
I don't know.

192
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.520
Everyone knows it.

193
00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:39.000
(Radio) ... the nation
of the former arch-enemy

194
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.160
in a different,
more favorable light.

195
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:44.000
So it comes as no surprise,

196
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.360
that the flagship foreign ministers
of Germany and France

197
00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.320
today, on Pillory Day,

198
00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:53.120
a national-cultural phenomenon
to a national-cultural phenomenon,

199
00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.800
that the German theater

200
00:17:55.320 --> 00:17:59.400
its global reputation almost
almost single-handedly,

201
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.880
after he was already
already thought lost.

202
00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.200
Brecht's "Threepenny Opera"

203
00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.720
will be performed tonight
at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm

204
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.160
with a visit from the two
Nobel Peace Prize laureates.

205
00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.680
Prangertag, what is that?

206
00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:16.520
Corpus Christi.

207
00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320
This is ...

208
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:20.760
Today.

209
00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.000
*driving, ticking music*

210
00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.320
I have to go.

211
00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:32.200
Mr. Briand! How do you assess
the political situation in Germany?

212
00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:35.520
There is always danger
for a young democracy.

213
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:39.400
But democracy
is worth fighting for.

214
00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:42.120
Thank you very much.
- Mr. Briand, come in.

215
00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.320
*exciting music*

216
00:18:57.800 --> 00:18:59.320
When then, Heinrich.

217
00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:06.720
Ladies and gentlemen,
to an entertaining evening!

218
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.880
Very much to the good.

219
00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.640
*exciting music*

220
00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:15.840
I have to say,
I haven't been to the theater for a long time.

221
00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.360
To the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm.
Quickly!

222
00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.880
*exciting music*

223
00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:27.640
*Bell rings.

224
00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.960
*exciting music*

225
00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:36.360
Thank you very much.

226
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:09.600
*exciting music*

227
00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:13.400
Can't you drive any faster?

228
00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:17.520
*exciting music*

229
00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:01.280
*exciting music*

230
00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.880
ID card!

231
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:12.800
Pass.

232
00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.640
*Instruments are tuned.

233
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:27.440
Sorry, colleague.
Security level 1.

234
00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:30.480
Only those who are on the list,
will get in.

235
00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:33.400
Where is Government Councillor Benda?
Already above.

236
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:35.680
Then bring him here.
 What?

237
00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:38.440
Inspector Rath must speak to him.

238
00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:40.480
Nobody gets in with me.

239
00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.120
I have to go in there.
Not today.

240
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:46.800
You may be important out here.
You won't get in.

241
00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:53.600
*applause*

242
00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:13.880
*applause*

243
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.360
"And the shark, it has teeth
and he wears them on his face."

244
00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.840
"And Macheath, he's got a knife."

245
00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.280
"But you can't see the knife."

246
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.400
*exciting music*

247
00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.120
*dull thud*

248
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:19.560
*exciting music*

249
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.400
To counter the increasing hardening
of the people,

250
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.400
had the businessman
Jonathan Jeremiah Peachum

251
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:11.760
opened a store,

252
00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.920
in which the most wretched of the wretched
received that appearance,

253
00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:19.160
that spoke to the ever
hardened hearts.

254
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.960
(other actor)
Something new has to happen.

255
00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.920
My business is too difficult,
because it is my business,

256
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.600
human compassion
to awaken human compassion.

257
00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:33.640
There are a few things
that shake people.

258
00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.320
A few,
but the bad thing is,

259
00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.120
that, applied several times,
are no longer effective.

260
00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.200
*His voice softens.

261
00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:49.120
*exciting music*

262
00:24:49.360 --> 00:24:50.360
*He speaks French.

263
00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.720
*Actors speak
in the background*.

264
00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:03.200
(actor) ... the third time

265
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:06.400
he hands him over in cold blood
to the police.

266
00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:09.360
*exciting music*

267
00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.400
(Actress) Please don't!

268
00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.800
Take it easy.

269
00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.640
Put down your weapon and get up.

270
00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.120
Are you alone?

271
00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:07.960
*shot*

272
00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:10.760
*shot*

273
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680
*Shots*

274
00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:16.360
*Shots*

275
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:20.560
*applause*

276
00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:23.200
*shot*

277
00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.880
*exciting music*

278
00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:42.280
Mr. Minister.
- Time for a little refreshment.

279
00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.560
An amusing piece.

280
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.800
*exciting music*

281
00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.320
Stand still!

282
00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.840
Has a man just
a man just come by?

283
00:27:14.800 --> 00:27:15.320
With a bag?

284
00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:18.200
Yes, a colleague.
Has identified himself.

285
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:22.920
Stand still! Stop!

286
00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.760
So, you're not going to budge
from the spot.

287
00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640
*He groans.

288
00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:42.280
Cancel action.

289
00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.800
On the lighting platform lies
the body of an assassin.

290
00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:10.800
Let go of the inspector.
Viewed from stage right.

291
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.520
Come on! You heard what he said,
what he said.

292
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.120
(actor)
Smith, what does he want from me?

293
00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:21.360
That's good,
that you are using the table ...

294
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.800
Which side?

295
00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.760
(actor) We want to take him
in right away,

296
00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.720
so that he can see what
attitude we have against him.

297
00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:34.400
*removed street noises*

298
00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.760
*exciting music*

299
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:44.760
Good evening.

300
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:53.760
I see you're finding your way around.

301
00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.200
Hm.

302
00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:07.480
Please.

303
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.440
So, I'm listening.

304
00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.720
The train is sent back.

305
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.480
And with it
the wagon with the gold.

306
00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.960
There is no gold in the wagon.
There is.

307
00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.840
We have personally
convinced ourselves of this.

308
00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.800
The wagon numbers
have been exchanged.

309
00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:38.480
You have opened the wrong one.

310
00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:42.120
The gold is still inside
and should be on its way to Russia

311
00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:45.960
before the border
before the border. With a robbery.

312
00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.200
From whom?

313
00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:49.960
From men
of the "Black Reichswehr".

314
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.480
When?

315
00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:53.120
Tomorrow.

316
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:14.160
Apart from Scheer and the second man
there were certainly other men

317
00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.960
from our own ranks
involved.

318
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:21.320
Our enemies are everywhere,
Even in the castle. For a long time.

319
00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:24.240
I'm sure of it,
Scheer would have unpacked.

320
00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.000
He was executed,
in front of my eyes.

321
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.800
Do you have any suspicions?

322
00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520
Wolter.

323
00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:34.320
He plays a decisive role
in this conspiracy.

324
00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.000
You are probably right about that.

325
00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:41.360
As you know, he has been under
been under observation for some time.

326
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.720
But we couldn't prove anything
unfortunately.

327
00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.240
Not yet.

328
00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:51.920
Here it is.

329
00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.600
(Benda) Are you aware of this?

330
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.400
that you prevented a coup d'état
a coup d'état, Commissioner?

331
00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:08.320
The most important thing is
is that Stresemann is alive.

332
00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:12.200
And tomorrow morning
Seegers to the press.

333
00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.560
We'll take care of Wolter afterwards.

334
00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.480
Have a good rest, Mr. Colleague.
See you tomorrow!

335
00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.760
Good night.

336
00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.000
*quiet music

337
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:45.560
*Door squeaks softly.

338
00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.720
You can go.

339
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:44.960
Yes?

340
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.240
Comm.

341
00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.400
(Toni) I know why Lotte
wanted to surprise me with this.

342
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:58.400
Why is that?
- Because it's my favorite dish.

343
00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:01.480
And because I've never had it
had it for breakfast.

344
00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.520
Especially not this good.
- It's really good.

345
00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:08.360
I love watching our chef
when he prepares this.

346
00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.800
How he separates the egg yolk from the egg white

347
00:34:11.400 --> 00:34:13.400
and beats the snow
with a broom,

348
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:17.200
Ten times to the left and ten times to the right,
very, very fast.

349
00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:21.280
And we always have fresh raspberries
raspberries in our cold store.

350
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:23.800
Do you have a cold room?
- Of course you do.

351
00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.120
And always raspberries?
- Yes.

352
00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:28.160
Great!

353
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:29.520
*He laughs.

354
00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.680
I've never
in such a fancy place

355
00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:35.680
"Berlin air" eaten.

356
00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.760
Your sister
had a wish.

357
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.680
Lotte!
There you are.

358
00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:47.240
Such a great surprise.

359
00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.680
Would you like to sit down, Miss?

360
00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.480
How ... how did you
got here?

361
00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:58.400
I was picked up in a fancy
automobile.

362
00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:01.920
And your friend here
has entertained me very well.

363
00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:05.200
That was the best "Berlin air"
