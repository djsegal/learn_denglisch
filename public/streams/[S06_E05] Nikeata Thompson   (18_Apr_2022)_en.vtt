00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.200
.

2
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.320
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.640
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.200
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.240
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.520
Nikeata Thompson, 41 years old,

7
00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.680
choreographer, entrepreneur
and stage coach.

8
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.320
Nikeata?
Yes.

9
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.800
Right away a sad story
to the beginning.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.160
That's how it is sometimes,
ups and downs.

11
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.240
But you have caused me
this sadness to me.

12
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.800
Yes, but soon
we are happy again.

13
00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.520
Nah, really,
should I tell it like it is?

14
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.720
I'm sorry that we have to
in public.

15
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.600
Today at noon I went
my Insta thing through

16
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.360
and saw that you
follow me since today.

17
00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.640
Are you laughing or what?
I'm crying here and you're laughing?

18
00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.040
I still said ...
Can you explain that to me?

19
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.040
For me it's like this:
I clean up, delete everything.

20
00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.920
Then I add everything again
and see who gives me love.

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.600
If you do not give me love,
I will not follow.

22
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.720
I thought we were friends
and you delete me.

23
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.000
Do you know what happened today?
I thought I was going to break off.

24
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.160
Shit.
As punishment, here I come. - Come.

25
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.600
I knew it - shit.

26
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.120
You can't let me ...
Then it says: "Follows you today".

27
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:36.760
Come! Now we see each other
finally after so many years.

28
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.240
How long did we not see each other?
2-3 years.

29
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.320
But we had contact.
We are thick friends.

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.880
Best friends, they would say.

31
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.760
The best friends are the ones
you see again after 3 years,

32
00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.600
connects directly there and says:
You broke my heart!

33
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.840
We have never met,
never chilled.

34
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.600
Always only professionally.
Hm...

35
00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.880
Now again.
Yes.

36
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.560
Well, shall we get started?
Please, I am ready.

37
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.960
We go through the biography
first.

38
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.040
You were born in Birmingham.
Your mother still lives there.

39
00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.840
Growing up in Wermelskirchen
- how did that come about?

40
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.800
Birmingham is England, by the way.
It could have been Florida.

41
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.520
Wermelskirchen not.
Wermelskirchen not.

42
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.760
That's next to Leverkusen,
for those who don't know it,

43
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.480
or Wuppertal, Remscheid,
or something.

44
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.840
I come from Wermelskirchen, but my
my first stop was Hückeswagen.

45
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.880
What kind of car?
Hückeswagen.

46
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.400
Hückeswagen?
That is even smaller.

47
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.520
And then I was in Wermelskirchen.

48
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.600
Also quite nice.
Rural, super rural.

49
00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.320
You can't tell that
I often hear that I come from there.

50
00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.560
Although I am full Wermelskirchen.

51
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.360
To Hückeswagen
I would have addressed you.

52
00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.800
Wermelskirchen
would have been foreign to me.

53
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.920
You said in an interview
life in the village

54
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.400
was like being in a zoo for you.
Why? - Yes, it was crass.

55
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.240
There was only one dark-skinned woman
and her name was Nikeata Thompson.

56
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.680
Really, even at school there was
no one with dark skin.

57
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.840
Maybe brown hair,
which is pretty normal,

58
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.480
but no black.

59
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.000
For me, it was like this,
as soon as I went out,

60
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.920
they used to say:
"Maybe that's who did it."

61
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.160
I was often to blame for things
where I was not even there.

62
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.800
That was interesting.

63
00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.640
My parents then stood up for me
"Nikeata wasn't there at all."

64
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.240
Was it about,
who fucked up ...

65
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.240
That wasn't them at all,
the child was at training.

66
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.000
You were bullied at school.

67
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.480
Your teacher has
but once stood up for you.

68
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.120
Yes, that's right.

69
00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.080
Do you know her name?
No. - Mrs. Schwarz.

70
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.200
Mrs. Schwarz? Yes, horny.
No fun.

71
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:48.280
Can you tell us what she did with the children?
with the kids? - Yes, that was gross.

72
00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.880
I always had to take the bus

73
00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.600
and there were two girls,
they didn't like me.

74
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.400
But we had no problem until
I got on the bus one day.

75
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560
We always wanted to sit in the back.

76
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.840
I went to the back because I
I wanted to be one of the cool ones.

77
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560
So I went
as far back as possible.

78
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.080
And they came at me,
as soon as I sat

79
00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.880
and have really given me one.

80
00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.080
Beaten?
Yes, but really.

81
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.680
They were siblings,
but they did not look alike.

82
00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.640
I only found out about that afterwards.

83
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760
I was in shock,
because no one helped me.

84
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.600
Everyone pretended
as if it had not happened.

85
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.840
You sit there and think:
"Why isn't anyone helping me?"

86
00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.760
There were adults there.
That is also bad.

87
00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.680
The next day
my parents were going to drive me to school.

88
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.320
But it turned out that
Nikeata was not up for it.

89
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.280
Like this, "I am no longer ..."

90
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.920
I did not want to put up with that
I didn't want to put up with that and went along again.

91
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.480
Then I sat in the school class
and still remember exactly,

92
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.880
we had a double lesson in art.

93
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:57.960
My teacher,
no, principal came in

94
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.800
and I thought: "Now this
this thing all over again.

95
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.920
I did something again."

96
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.120
Then she said, "We're interrupting
class because of Nikeata."

97
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.800
I thought:
"Oh no, here we go again."

98
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.200
That's unpleasant.
Everyone's looking at you again. - Yes.

99
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.680
Then students came in one by one.
I did not know many of them by sight.

100
00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.880
They said, "I'm sorry,
for calling you Negro."

101
00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.760
"...that I spit on you."

102
00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.520
"... that I poured water
over your hair."

103
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.760
"...pulled at your braids."
She had everyone dance up. - All.

104
00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:34.320
It took not quite
quite 2 lessons,

105
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.240
because we were still talking about it.

106
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.960
But they really came.

107
00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.720
And I always had in mind,
that 2 annoy me.

108
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.160
Once upon a time there were twin brothers
and the Kai, whom I found totally cute.

109
00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:52.120
The three, that was for me
the worst thing in my head.

110
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.520
The rest I had
no longer in my head.

111
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.640
Except, of course, being locked in the toilet
being locked up, you realize.

112
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.360
That was so gross:
The next day during the break

113
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.440
I get for the first time
in my life notes:

114
00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.880
"Do you want to be my girlfriend?
Yes, no, maybe."

115
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.640
I immediately "yes",
there was no "maybe.

116
00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.760
No matter what they said before.

117
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.720
I was not resentful.
That is different today.

118
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.880
I'm like, "Yeah." "Yes."

119
00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.080
And then I was cool ever since.

120
00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:26.320
And the affiliation came then.

121
00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:30.480
You could send the director to the AfD
to pull that off there, too,

122
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.840
that all
apologize to you.

123
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.560
They have to apologize
apologize to several.

124
00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.200
A great woman,
that she did it that way.

125
00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.800
I don't know,
what happened in the back.

126
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.640
I think it's gone
gone my whole way,

127
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.640
because she suddenly knew everyone.

128
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.200
You started to do sports

129
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.520
and came via ballet
and tennis to athletics.

130
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.200
We have some results here.
Oh God!

131
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.920
But that's ...

132
00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.680
Where did you get my ...
I really am.

133
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:03.080
Scheeßel - those are my times.
I have forgotten them.

134
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.160
Sure, 4 x 100 m relay:
50.1 seconds.

135
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.800
I am 18 then.

136
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.680
Why weren't you at the Olympics?
You were the champion.

137
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.200
You want a drink?
I have something with me.

138
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.680
What do you mean?
Do you also have something to eat?

139
00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.760
Nah...
What are you doing now?

140
00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.400
I would love to drink a cup of tea.

141
00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:26.440
You wrote so many times
written on Instagram:

142
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.320
"Let's have some coffee, tea ..."

143
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:31.160
Don't you have water here?
Do we have ...

144
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:34.640
What's it like when we're here ...?
Oh, you know what that is?

145
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.760
This looks like a longboard.

146
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.440
Do you have water?

147
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.400
Is one free?

148
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.480
Not that everything goes out.
Not that the cameras go out.

149
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:49.440
What kind of tea are you making?
Do you want Earl Grey?

150
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.080
Do you even like tea?
So nothing that makes you awake.

151
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.840
Oh, Earl Grey wakes you up, huh?

152
00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.760
Brought everything.
You said you wanted tea.

153
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.960
You are top prepared.
Do you have forest honey? - Nope.

154
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.800
I always drink with forest honey.
Not such a stuffy shit.

155
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:11.920
We'll get to the stuffiness,
Mrs. Thompson.

156
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:14.000
But that takes time now.

157
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.720
Did you open one for me too
or just for you?

158
00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:19.160
Only to you, because I thought
you drink tea.

159
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:22.080
I have to drink tea,
but need water.

160
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.280
Oh, well, then take this.
Yes, that's what I wanted.

161
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.480
I feel like I'm back in the day.

162
00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.360
Has also still no
brought tea. - No?

163
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.480
May I ask questions on the side?

164
00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.480
Of course, I am bilingual,
I can do everything.

165
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.160
Make yourself at home.
Yes.

166
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.280
Your breakthrough came in 2003 when you were
were hired by Seeed.

167
00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.000
After that it was uphill.

168
00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:49.320
You have worked with almost
the most important celebrities.

169
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.440
Who can dance better?
Yes, who?

170
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.800
Heidi Klum ...
Or? - Tom Hanks?

171
00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.480
Heidi makes
more moves in a row.

172
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.240
We only had 6 moves then,
which is not much.

173
00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:04.600
Do you know what I mean?
I don't know the moves.

174
00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:07.200
That's what you're learning from me,
I am a coach.

175
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.880
He had very little time.

176
00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.200
I was born with a stick up my ass,
could you teach me something?

177
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:16.920
Heidi always says:
"It's not in my DNA, whooo."

178
00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:19.680
"Whooo, it's not
in my DNA, whooo!"

179
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.880
When could I dance a mambo?
I don't know any classical dances.

180
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.520
I am self-taught.

181
00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.960
How long would I have to meet
to meet with you... - 1,5 hours.

182
00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:32.360
... so that people say:
"Hey dude, he's coming from the dance."

183
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.960
"It comes from dancing" is nonsense.
We need a year there.

184
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.720
We are now on Chapter 2:
Racism.

185
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.800
We have met ...
You arrived at the rbb today,

186
00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.760
i was standing outside
because I squawked one

187
00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.080
and the first,
you tell me is:

188
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.480
"I was racially accosted an hour ago.
racist attack."

189
00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:57.920
You were out and about in Prenzl'berg.
We have the video.

190
00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.720
You were so cool
to record this.

191
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.560
Someone else recorded that.

192
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.040
"Here, you're a drug seller,

193
00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.240
Nigerian drug seller.
Yes.

194
00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.160
Everything is there.
We ash Nigeria.

195
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.640
Why haven't you
not done it yet?"

196
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.920
That wasn't so bad:
Drug seller ...

197
00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:21.560
I can laugh about that.

198
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.640
Then things really got going.

199
00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.720
Then that was all,
what I know so,

200
00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:29.800
only in a different version.

201
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.600
He said, "Heads will roll.
In the old days, you would have been ..."

202
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.840
- what you just do with gas.

203
00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.960
He also knew where I was from.
After all, I can't be German.

204
00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.080
I find that interesting as well.

205
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.920
It's often like that on the web, too.

206
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:48.720
Once I have an opinion:
"Be glad you're okay."

207
00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.040
That I have something to eat.
Thank you.

208
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.600
Do you say,
you come from Wermelskirchen,

209
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.280
comes the saying:
"But where native?"

210
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.840
Then I say:
"Ask your ancestors."

211
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.440
We also enslaved people.
We Germans do not believe that.

212
00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.080
We always deflect with the Yanks.
Nope, us too. - Sure, hello?!

213
00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.720
Do you notice too,

214
00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.440
Colonialism was not taught at school?
not taught? - No.

215
00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:13.080
Would be stupid to say:

216
00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.880
"We put the blacks
put in the zoo."

217
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:17.520
Who wants to tell that?

218
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.240
Jews has already been enough.

219
00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:22.160
We also have nothing
about Romas or Sintis ...

220
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.680
Now once again to the guy,
who was mentally confused.

221
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.400
We don't make a point there:

222
00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:31.360
"He's confused,
that's why he's talking shit."

223
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.400
There are also
not mentally impaired,

224
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.120
who say that anyway.

225
00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.840
You didn't record this,
but you're totally cool.

226
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.720
You say to me:
"Here, this is my life."

227
00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.920
Where I do not know
what I would have done,

228
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.320
whether I had cried.
That came afterwards.

229
00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:52.560
Whether I would have hidden.
I needed something.

230
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.640
I must say,
today it was a crushing feeling,

231
00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.840
because there were 6 people
who defended me - passers-by.

232
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.680
Not people you were with
but passers-by.

233
00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.520
A crass feeling.
What did they say?

234
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:09.480
First they looked
and posed to it.

235
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.400
A man made announcements
that he should leave,

236
00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:17.520
we don't need that kind of shit
and that he is all wrong here,

237
00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:21.560
that he would not tolerate it
and has placed himself in front of us.

238
00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.440
I have to say,
that never happens to me.

239
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.760
If you're used to that ...

240
00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:34.880
At some point it is so, we humans
have an urge to survive.

241
00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:37.400
So you don't want
not take too long ...

242
00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.800
I have been
very much looking forward to today.

243
00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.720
Accordingly, I was like:
"Brush it off.

244
00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.240
No, he doesn't
my day!"

245
00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.120
There are other situations,
that take you more seriously.

246
00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.800
It is always different,
you never count on it. How could you?

247
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.760
Derim said all the while:
"I didn't expect this."

248
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.800
How to count on it?

249
00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:04.600
It is war since 2014,
but now acute once again.

250
00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:06.520
People flee.

251
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:08.640
May also flee.

252
00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.520
Are allowed in neighboring countries,
if they are white.

253
00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:17.440
What is ...?
Have we learned nothing there?

254
00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.840
We learned nothing,
because we didn't talk about it.

255
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Nor about where the blacks
were during the 1st World War.

256
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:28.200
So I always thought,
they didn't exist in Germany.

257
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:31.080
As a child and teenager
and teenager did not perceive,

258
00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:33.000
because they were not told about it.

259
00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.440
Until I read books and thought:
When was that and where were they?

260
00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.520
Why did they come here?

261
00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:41.880
I knew nothing about
a Berlin Congo conference.

262
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.440
All these things
were not a concept to me.

263
00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.120
We wondered
earlier in the editorial office,

264
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.800
I didn't have that in school,
whether my kids would...

265
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.440
I did not deal
deal with it. - I did not have it.

266
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.480
I didn't ask if it was now
in 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th grade.

267
00:13:58.640 --> 00:14:01.800
theme is?
No, it is not an issue.

268
00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.600
V.a. we also do not know,
where our vocabulary comes from.

269
00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.440
Everything has a home.

270
00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.560
We now know
that some things are not said.

271
00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.720
Gassing was not cool
and therefore one leaves.

272
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.920
We have a list of things
that you don't say.

273
00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:24.040
This: "You're quite nice,
I don't mean you.

274
00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.680
I mean the others."

275
00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.800
I also know this from friends:

276
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:32.840
Strange people grab the hair
and have no distance.

277
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.040
They don't notice when I say:
"Don't touch me!"

278
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.800
Let's keep talking.
You think about...

279
00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.720
I also have beautiful things in life.

280
00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.120
...to change your last name.
Did you catch that?

281
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:47.320
Of course, am I prepared
am I not? - Are you.

282
00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.400
Thompson is a slave name.

283
00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.680
This is my white name.

284
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.520
People who, for example
come from the Caribbean

285
00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.160
- to explain it simply
and quickly explain -

286
00:14:57.320 --> 00:15:01.120
not only natural ...
It is very complex.

287
00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:04.520
Africa is a huge continent
with many languages.

288
00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.960
The language African
does not exist - that's what some people think.

289
00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:10.120
No, there are so many languages,

290
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:12.960
they do not understand
with each other.

291
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:15.200
Hamburg - Bavaria.
(laughs) Something like that.

292
00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:18.880
A bad example.
But there is - something accent.

293
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:25.160
One must imagine that
the English are also to Africa,

294
00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:29.320
like the Germans, Dutch,
Portuguese, Spanish, Italian

295
00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.200
and the Danes and in general.

296
00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:34.360
But the English
had more coal and ships,

297
00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.680
to enslave these people,
to buy them in.

298
00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:39.320
A little Amazonian.

299
00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:43.240
Then the English shipped us
most of us to Jamaica.

300
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.480
Therefore, I have ancestors in Jamaica.

301
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:49.360
Everyone says, "Awesome," I say:
"Yeah, but it has a story."

302
00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.280
Is not only horny.

303
00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:56.480
If you listen closely to the lyrics of
Bob Marley, that's what he says:

304
00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.080
"Stolen from Africa, brought
to America, buffalo soldier."

305
00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.840
This is what he tells us.

306
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.360
That one was raped and abducted
the families apart.

307
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:08.760
And when you were on the plantation,

308
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.800
the plantation had
the name from the slave trader.

309
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.960
And his name was Thompson.
And that's my name.

310
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:22.280
All the slaves that were there,
were named Thompson? - Yes.

311
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.520
They were of course
also mistreated, beaten.

312
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.560
The people were allowed to do what
they wanted, they were the police.

313
00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:31.600
There was no overhand that said,

314
00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.440
but here is stop
with the rape.

315
00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.440
To be a Negro was yes,
not to be a human being,

316
00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.560
but a benefit,
a cattle, a cow.

317
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:48.440
You got tattoos and everything
and that's how it was handled.

318
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.480
One was property.

319
00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:55.080
Therefore I would like to replace the name
Thompson. It's going away.

320
00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.200
Then I take
my middle name Nzinga.

321
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.120
Okay, then Thompson gone.
Yep, Nikeata Nzinga. - When.

322
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.360
I now have a German passport.

323
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.000
I had to wait for that one,
so that it would not be so complicated.

324
00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:10.120
Everyone said it was going to be complicated.

325
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.840
Corona makes everything take longer.

326
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.560
You also once said
that you feel very German.

327
00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:18.880
We also have a video.
What?!

328
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.960
"Dear ones,
I'm going to get a latte.

329
00:17:22.120 --> 00:17:23.760
Here is half a concert.

330
00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:26.080
It's so loud
that I get upset.

331
00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.720
Am I too German?"

332
00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:29.600
That really got me excited.

333
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.840
What is it like when your neighbors
listen to music too loud?

334
00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.680
Are you going over there or
are you going to call the police?

335
00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:37.960
No, I try to be tolerant.

336
00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.040
It's always interesting that people expect
expect that my music ...

337
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:45.360
Typical German is:
Mowing the lawn, but not 12-15.

338
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:48.560
I do not know,
I don't have a plot yet.

339
00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.240
I do not know my way around.

340
00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:54.200
Would you observe the lunch break
and then mow the lawn?

341
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.240
I can't say that,
I'm not ready yet.

342
00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.880
But things do bother me.

343
00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.080
I'm definitely irritable.
What bothers you?

344
00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.320
I am bothered when
I have my window open

345
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.200
and it comes
cigarette nicotine shit comes in.

346
00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.680
No, so if I know that ...
My mother was a chain smoker.

347
00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.440
Then I smoke another one.

348
00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.840
I am tolerant, but I can
not stand when I stand like this

349
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.280
and Izzy, my better half,
stands there

350
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:24.720
and I get
the whole shit in the face.

351
00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:26.840
Then I'm like, "Yo, Izzy, yo."

352
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.560
I am not ...
But is that German?

353
00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.200
This is a nuisance.
That annoys me.

354
00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.040
German is after all:
Car wash always on Saturdays.

355
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:38.640
I do not have a car. - And can
I do not mow the lawn 12-15 o'clock,

356
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.360
I make with the nail scissors
in the 3 hours lunch break ...

357
00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:45.760
That could be me, the main thing,
I gotta get my work done.

358
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:47.960
So: I have set myself something.

359
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.600
But that was in L.A.

360
00:18:49.760 --> 00:18:53.040
With America, I always think:
"Oh yeah I am so cheeky and stuff."

361
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:55.960
Then I go to a restaurant
and hear nothing.

362
00:18:56.120 --> 00:18:58.560
I think, what is that?
In the restaurant.

363
00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.600
I hear nothing - horror.
That really bothered me.

364
00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.600
I almost had a headache.

365
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.640
Is that German?
That is simply noise pollution.

366
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:09.560
For the others, it was normal.

367
00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.080
They couldn't talk at all,
I thought.

368
00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.760
I then calmed down,
because I thought,

369
00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:17.640
that could be a bit very stuffy.

370
00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.440
Can you explain to me
what cultural appropriation is?

371
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.680
There was this white musician
with the dreadlocks.

372
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.360
I only heard about that for a short time,
because I was at work.

373
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.200
Did she have a performance
at the Brandenburg Gate?

374
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.640
Nah, in Hanover
for "Friday for Future

375
00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.160
and they said:
"Cut off dreadlocks

376
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.320
Or you can't perform."
Who said that? - Friday for Future.

377
00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:47.240
Are they white or black?
I do not know, but I suspect ...

378
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:50.920
I think they are white.
... that they are white. - Funny!

379
00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:57.600
Earlier we were talking about
what cultural appropriation is.

380
00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:00.000
Do you have an example?
Yes, of course.

381
00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.120
Cultural appropriation is, for example,

382
00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:05.840
when Elvis Presley suddenly
comes out with a song,

383
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.040
that belongs to a black woman
and makes a hit.

384
00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.480
Cultural appropriation is,
when you turn on the TV

385
00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.400
and the music is actually from
someone else, like rock 'n' roll,

386
00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:18.120
but you always see white people.

387
00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.640
That's why you think
that is something white.

388
00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.560
Techno, you think, is white,
comes from black people.

389
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.720
Because you don't see:
"Oh, a black man did that ..."

390
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.040
I take away the culture ...

391
00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.040
And don't give them props either.

392
00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.720
You are supposed to celebrate that ...

393
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.640
I'm stealing this: "Kiss my ass,
I made it up, it's mine."

394
00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.640
The Queen has gold on her head,
a lot of English people get upset:

395
00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:44.560
"Where are the diamonds from?"

396
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:48.200
Diamonds usually do not come
not from Germany or England.

397
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.960
Stealing these things and not
address where they come from.

398
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.720
I.e., someone has his hair so,
that is another division.

399
00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.840
That was blatant with Kim Kardashian,
she had such peasant braids.

400
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.640
All of a sudden she said,
they're called boxer braids.

401
00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:06.760
That's when everyone got upset,
because this hairstyle is normal

402
00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.480
for a black girl.

403
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.800
We have problems,
Getting jobs.

404
00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:13.280
If I had dreadlocks,
that would be...

405
00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.040
I have problems,
to make myself dreadlocks,

406
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.720
because I think
then I would have even more stress.

407
00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.160
That is a stress factor,
I don't need any more stress.

408
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:24.800
Do the hair the way you want,
but understand,

409
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.920
that we have problems,
only when we walk around normally.

410
00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.720
Hair was a political thing
- Black Panther.

411
00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.880
This afro wig is also like that.
Yes, does not work at all.

412
00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.080
When I have them on for Mardi Gras.

413
00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.360
You can have it,
but then paint it black?

414
00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.160
What black man paints himself white?

415
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.840
Unless you color your face
like Michael Jackson.

416
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.080
Thomas Gottschalk
was in Los Angeles

417
00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.120
dressed up as Jimi Hendrix
dressed up and said:

418
00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:54.240
"I know now,
how black people feel." Stupid!

419
00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.640
I don't even know what I'm ...

420
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.520
That was sick.

421
00:21:58.680 --> 00:22:02.840
Is that the fraction racist or
simply stupid, not enlightened?

422
00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.640
They can all choose that.
Sorry, but that was for me ...

423
00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.560
That was the end.
I thought, "For God's sake!"

424
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:16.280
Where do we start when someone,
who is so well known and loved...

425
00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.920
I think it's great!

426
00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.360
I have had the conversations
with my German family as well.

427
00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:23.600
With whom you no longer have any contact.

428
00:22:23.760 --> 00:22:26.840
Can we get out of this shit?
Can we enlighten?

429
00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.280
We have to talk
talk about it again and again?!

430
00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:32.240
With the finger "you, you"
- no one wants to learn.

431
00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:36.160
I wrote the book because
I can't even get close to my family.

432
00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.640
I come more easily
to strangers.

433
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.680
One of my family,
who always listens to Bob Marley,

434
00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.360
shouted, "I'm not a Nazi!"

435
00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.800
Did I just say you're a Nazi?
Why don't you listen?

436
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.880
That was the accusation:
"You grew up here ...

437
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.720
You're fine, aren't you?"

438
00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:54.160
It's like gay people,
when I say:

439
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:57.040
"Stop complaining,
You can get married."

440
00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:00.880
And then you find yourself again,
it is, after all, a structure.

441
00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.320
You don't want to let go of anyone,
I love my family.

442
00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.400
Then comes one thigh-slapper
after the other.

443
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.760
And when it settles down again,
again a spell:

444
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.040
"Back then, child, it was so sweet,
you were also so full of life.

445
00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:18.280
Boah, such a fun-loving kid."

446
00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.920
Yes, for all.

447
00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.560
"Nikeata, you were really different,
always a little outgoing."

448
00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.880
Then someone yells:
"Negro, Negro" and you run to it

449
00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.680
and you don't even check it!

450
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.000
I don't know
whether I have checked that.

451
00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:38.040
I was all the time
already at the end, you could also see.

452
00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:40.520
But somehow
there is no compassion.

453
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.760
In America
there are "fast words":

454
00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.720
"White tears are more worth
than brown tears."

455
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.480
So, when a white woman
or man cries,

456
00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.880
you can understand it better.

457
00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:56.120
With a black person
you have no sympathy.

458
00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.840
That has always been the case.

459
00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.720
When there is a war, people accuse me
people reproach me by saying:

460
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.920
You are not German at all,
go back to your country.

461
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.320
You actually know
what triggers it.

462
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.520
You don't say that,
if you don't know a little...

463
00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:13.720
When someone is fat,
people say, "You're too fat."

464
00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:17.040
Or: "You fatso".
That one goes on appearances.

465
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:19.280
And above all:
"You don't belong here.

466
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.880
I do not accept you
in my country."

467
00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:25.320
"This is my Germany"
was also said to me today.

468
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.440
What exactly is yours?
Tell me.

469
00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:31.400
I always hear people saying:

470
00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.840
"One no longer knows
what one is allowed to say.

471
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.960
Then I say, "You've got it tough,
You can't say "nigger" anymore.

472
00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.200
This is really a problem.
Gosh, that's bad.

473
00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:44.440
Now you have to think,
now you feel bad.

474
00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:47.560
I then think:
Do you want to do the Hitler salute,

475
00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:50.280
Say "Heil Hitler"
or "Foreigners out"?

476
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:53.200
It's called "white tears,
white privileges".

477
00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:56.800
Suddenly you are attacked as a white
you are attacked as a white person.

478
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.440
That's new.

479
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:01.160
Honestly, how long has this been around?

480
00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:04.960
Nikeata, the show is over.
We're going out now.

481
00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:07.440
In your book
you write at the end,

482
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.880
that you would like
that you would like to have a statue of yourself.

483
00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:11.520
Yes, like Nzinga.

484
00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:15.520
Nzinga was a queen
who fought against the Portuguese.

485
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.960
* exclamation of astonishment *

486
00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.600
* laughs

487
00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:23.800
This is not a statue, but ...
There I look good, a good picture.

488
00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.480
We're going to recreate that as a statue,
that we can do this in gold...

489
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:30.120
Is it as big as me?
I do not know.

490
00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:32.360
It's like Madame Tussauds.

491
00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.600
You always look so horny.
I have practiced.

492
00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.400
I couldn't do that before.

493
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.040
After 30 years in showbiz
I have no picture,

494
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.760
where I look rudimentary so horny.
I have to.

495
00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:47.280
Can we look horny?
You must be so ...

496
00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.520
(quietly) Imagine,
you're in bed with your sweetie.

497
00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.640
Then you want to be a little sexy.
That's not how you do.

498
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.760
It's like this.
"Bed eyes" is what they call it.

499
00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.400
Where is the camera?
Close your eyes a little,

500
00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.480
a little too, a little wicked.

501
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.680
I'm a little excited about myself.

502
00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.320
And breathe hard.

503
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.400
* Both breathe emphatically loudly. *

504
00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:13.600
I spit on myself.
Move head slightly.

505
00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:15.800
That doesn't matter, spit is supi.

506
00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.320
(quietly) Move head, slightly lascivious.

507
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.160
What's with the tongue or something?
(quietly) Nix, nix, too much.

508
00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:31.000
(continues whispering)
Open mouth slightly.

509
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.920
Yes, beautiful, beautiful.

510
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.400
Close your eyes, I'll stop.

511
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.680
Yes, that looks good.
One laughs here.

512
00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:41.480
I'm ashamed.
Shall I walk you out?

513
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:45.400
I can't blush, you can't tell
you can't tell when I'm ashamed.

514
00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:48.160
I play it cool.
I'm always sweating then.

515
00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:51.200
Oh, that gives you away.
For 30 years I have been ashamed.

516
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:53.920
I'm sad it's over.
Me too.

517
00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:55.560
It's in my way.

518
00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:58.600
I don't say this often,
but it was really nice.

519
00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.200
Even with such tough topics?
It was so short.

520
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:05.040
If you talk for 30 minutes
about racism... - That's stupid.

521
00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.360
... it's too short
and so choppy.

522
00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.560
This has something of:
"We're talking about racism now

523
00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.160
and next week
everything is funny again.

524
00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:16.040
V.a. I do not want
always talk about racism.

525
00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.880
But today was one of those days.

526
00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:20.280
You always go
to black people and say:

527
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:22.600
"You tell me
something about racism."

528
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.200
I would have to
with my potato friends

529
00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:28.600
talk about racism in the group.
It's a lot of fun.

530
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:31.920
You don't want to do that.
Life is too short. - Yes.

531
00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:35.240
Ciao, the light is off.
Take care neighbors, bye.

532
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.440
That was Nikeata Thompson.
She comes every week now.

533
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.280
* Music: Charles Aznavour *

534
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.920
# You are the one for me, for me

535
00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.320
# For me, formidable

536
00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:02.160
# You are my love,
very, very, very veritable

537
00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:09.480
# Et je voudrais pouvoir
un jour enfin te le dire

538
00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:11.960
# Te l'ecrire
