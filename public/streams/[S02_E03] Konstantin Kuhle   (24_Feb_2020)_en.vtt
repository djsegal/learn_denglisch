* Cough *

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.960
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

5
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.160
Konstantin Kuhle:
31 years old,

6
00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.480
Spokesman on domestic policy
of the FDP parliamentary group,

7
00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.200
Member of the Federal Executive Committee of the FDP.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.440
Mr. Kuhle, are you there yet?
Yes.

9
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.360
Tell me, did you
smoked pot as a teenager? Yes.

10
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.240
You were
as an exchange student in South America

11
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.280
and have done community service
in geriatric care. Yes.

12
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.760
What do you want in the FDP?
* Audience laughs. *

13
00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.280
Changing things for the better.
* Niau *

14
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.720
Zack. See for yourself, huh?
* (LAUGHING)

15
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.920
So, that's what we need to talk about
to talk about today.

16
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.680
Good morning, Mr. Kuhle.
Moin.

17
00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.560
To drink you have taken?
Yes. Runs with you.

18
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.720
So, Mr. Kuhle.

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.080
Do you know,
why you are here today?

20
00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.120
Not exactly, no.

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.280
In Thuringia, the FDP
allowed itself a very big Otto.

22
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.440
We look at the first VTR.
All right.

23
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.280
For the delegate Bodo Ramelow:
44 votes.

24
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.840
For Rep.
Thomas Kemmerich: 45 votes in favor.

25
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.720
Do you accept
the election for prime minister?

26
00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.680
I accept the election.
Then may I congratulate you.

27
00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.720
Do you know Thomas Kemmerich?
What kind of guy is he?

28
00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.680
I know him. He was my colleague
my colleague in the Bundestag.

29
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.560
Quite a reasonable guy.
I like him a lot.

30
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.280
I have now seen this
again for the first time.

31
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.920
I had seen it
on television and thought:

32
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.240
That changes a lot.

33
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.760
The first prime minister,

34
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.360
who came into office with votes from right-wing
who came to office with votes from right-wing extremists. Are you proud?

35
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.520
On the contrary.
I am ashamed of it.

36
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.360
I think it's terrible and
have had a shitty time ever since.

37
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.280
By the way, since then
many are under police protection

38
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.680
and have to listen to nasty things.

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.600
A really bad number.

40
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.000
Were you really surprised
or did you know about it beforehand?

41
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.440
I knew he was running.
That's what was said in the group.

42
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.320
Someone from Thuringia was there
and said: We'll try that.

43
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.680
Lindner said:
But not that you then

44
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.400
with the votes of the AfD
are elected.

45
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.920
We did not realize at that moment
did not realize,

46
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.440
that it really
can come down to this.

47
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.680
A week later, that day came.

48
00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.160
I saw it and did not know
what it meant.

49
00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.960
I thought about it
and I realized,

50
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.520
that this changes a lot,

51
00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.320
that this is a damage
of the political culture,

52
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.680
which must be reversed.

53
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.320
I am glad that Christian Lindner
said: That's not how it works.

54
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:18.680
And how did you find out about it?
From the television.

55
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.960
Wasn't that clear to some in advance?
I knew that he was running.

56
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.400
That's what the newspaper said.

57
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.000
But I did not know that this
happen like this. Not realized?

58
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.880
It is, after all, a secret ballot.

59
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.720
Why not realized?

60
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.560
I did not expect
that it would come to this.

61
00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.960
I think they thought ...

62
00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.120
In Thuringia, it is like in many
eastern German states.

63
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.040
The people have a different
socialization than many in the West.

64
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.840
I have understood this well in the last
days and weeks well understood.

65
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.400
There are people,
whose mother could not study,

66
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.920
because she allowed herself to be conformed,
the father was in Stasi prison.

67
00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.640
They say:
"I can't bring myself to do it.

68
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.880
I will not vote for anyone
the successor party of the SED

69
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.120
and just as little for
anyone from the radical right-wing AfD."

70
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.760
Then they came up with the idea,
to send Kemmerich into the race,

71
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.160
but did not think about a plan
of his election.

72
00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.120
I find that negligent,
a huge mistake.

73
00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.000
That broke a lot of things.

74
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.040
Mike Mohring says he has asked
AKK to call Lindner,

75
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.960
to keep Kemmerich
from competing.

76
00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.160
Mike Mohring says he told AKK,
she should say Lindner,

77
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.480
he should tell Kemmerich
that he should not run for office.

78
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.800
A bit silly, isn't it?
You want me to say now if that's true?

79
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.560
Or: "It's stupid to take your underpants
over your head."

80
00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.360
* (LAUGHING)
Yes, that's how it is.

81
00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.160
Can we write it like that?
Yes, you can send all that.

82
00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.960
We let you synchronize
and then you say exactly that.

83
00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.080
What can I say?
The underpants ... Please in camera 3.

84
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:04.120
Do not take off the underpants
over your head! Mr. Mohring. Exactly.

85
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.560
In the full sentence, please.
Dear Mike Mohring,

86
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.080
one should not take off the underpants
not to take off over the head.

87
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.520
* (LAUGHING)
That's good, also from my side.

88
00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.280
* Groan *

89
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.960
Did the Thuringian AfD leader
Höcke and Kemmerich a deal?

90
00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.080
I don't think so.
Thomas told me that is not so.

91
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.720
I don't know Björn Höcke.
I come from southern Lower Saxony ...

92
00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:32.000
But you know what he does.
Höcke? Cheating.

93
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.640
Sure, that's just around the corner from me.
He lives in the Eichsfeld.

94
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.000
We have a huge problem
with the extreme right-wing scene.

95
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.560
Do you live in his neighborhood?

96
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.760
Neighborhood you can not say,
but it is 60 km to Thuringia.

97
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.720
We have a massive problem

98
00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.720
with the extreme right-wing scene,
which comes over.

99
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.400
We know that this is a problem
and what kind of people they are.

100
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.040
Especially Höcke
is the AfD's chief Nazi.

101
00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:03.960
Did they have a deal
or not? No.

102
00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.600
No. So...

103
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:09.760
What they discussed, I don't know.
But I asked the one I know.

104
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.120
Thomas Kemmerich says no.

105
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.080
I now present evidence plate A.
Go.

106
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.720
* scattered laughter *

107
00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.240
This is a letter from Höcke,
I know it.

108
00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.280
Where is the proof of the deal?

109
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:28.120
Let me quote: "Offer you,

110
00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.720
to talk together about new forms
of cooperation.

111
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.480
A government of experts jointly
supported expert government

112
00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.840
or a minority government supported by the
supported minority government."

113
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.240
Yes, writes Höcke.
Where is the proof of the deal?

114
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.800
Maybe because he won? There
says, "I extend my hand."

115
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.920
When the
the Nazi stretches out his hand

116
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.280
and I say "you can forget it",
that's not a deal.

117
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.120
No way.
Kemmerich knew what he was doing.

118
00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.080
He confessed. "We had to
to expect this to happen."

119
00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.960
So that with the voices ...
Do not speak jumbled.

120
00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.920
* (LAUGHING)
Okay.

121
00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.560
Say again,
Mohring should ...

122
00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.840
Do not take the underpants
take them off over your head!

123
00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.320
Kemmerich has long since confessed:

124
00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:19.120
"We had to expect that,
that this would happen."

125
00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.400
So that he is elected with
elected with the votes of the AfD.

126
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:26.960
That's what he said to Ms. Slomka
in the ZDF interview. Correct, on Jan. 29.

127
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:30.320
But that's not a deal.
What then?

128
00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.320
You have to look at ...
Was that a deal?

129
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.000
No. You say no.
What was it again?

130
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.800
We come ...
You say no, I say yes. Exactly.

131
00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:43.680
Leaving that out of focus, saying:
"Maybe there was something funny",

132
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.480
the FDP
cannot let this sit on its hands.

133
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.320
There is no collusion
with right-wing radicals.

134
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:52.880
I sit in the plenum half a meter
half a meter away from them.

135
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.000
I hear the whining every week.
Cooperation does not work.

136
00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.760
To say:
"Maybe yes, maybe no" ...

137
00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.120
No, it must be quite clear
that there was nothing there.

138
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:06.280
Was it that clear?
Was it clear to everyone beforehand?

139
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.120
So ...
It seemed like:

140
00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.280
"I don't give a shit, we're winning now,
I don't care if we win with the right-wingers."

141
00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:17.040
I think it was:
"Fuck it, we're losing."

142
00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.840
He was completely perplexed that
he wins? He did so, after all.

143
00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.760
Something he said. Yes.

144
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.320
"Call my wife."
"Give me some pills" or something.

145
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.360
That must have been two sentences.
He probably said "shit.

146
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:36.640
Shit?
Because he didn't expect it.

147
00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.120
Nevertheless, Christian Lindner
still wanted to make us believe days later,

148
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.560
Kemmerich was
was "overwhelmed" by the election.

149
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:49.040
That is, your party leader
pleads like a sleazy lawyer

150
00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.640
on insanity,
even though it was pure calculation?

151
00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.520
It was not a calculation.
Do you really believe,

152
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.960
that Kemmerich said:
"I'll make a deal with Höcke"?

153
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.320
I was in Thuringia, after all.
That's how it arrived.

154
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.920
I am not the only one who
who thinks that. The question arises.

155
00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.280
The citizens thought:
This is cheating.

156
00:09:08.440 --> 00:09:11.040
Of course,
people want to know what was there.

157
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.880
I say: There was nothing.

158
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.120
It also does not work,
because this is a Nazi force.

159
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.280
So you say.
I would believe you.

160
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:23.360
That's what the Office for the Protection of the Constitution says.
I believe them.

161
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.400
That is already half the battle.

162
00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:27.720
(groans) How hard this is for you.

163
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.480
You are in a party
where people fuck up. Yes.

164
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:35.200
But you can't say:
"Lindner is stupid."

165
00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:38.200
After all, it is a party.
First of all, they are colleagues.

166
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:40.800
(laughs) Yes, first ...
You see for yourself, don't you?

167
00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.840
Sure, but... * (LAUGHING)
They are colleagues for now.

168
00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.120
You shit on them anywhere,
you're the ugly duckling.

169
00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.800
The Nest Defiler.

170
00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.800
It could thereby
become a beautiful swan.

171
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.960
But first you are
the nest-destroyer. That's right.

172
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:58.840
You're not into that, are you?
No, it sucks.

173
00:09:59.160 --> 00:10:02.200
(groans) There.
What is "overpowered" anyway?

174
00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:06.040
What is that term?
I don't know either. Übermannen.

175
00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.440
I can imagine something ...
Kemmerich had been "overwhelmed".

176
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.680
Yes. I think...
I looked it up in the dictionary.

177
00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:18.280
"Acting on someone in such a way that they
can no longer defend themselves."

178
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.880
He could have fought back.
Did he threaten him?

179
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.520
No. How can he threaten him?
Overman.

180
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.640
The state assembly president said:
"Do you accept the election or not?"

181
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:32.520
When do you
not accept the choice?

182
00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.560
Everyone who runs for office
actually says yes.

183
00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.680
40 years ...
You have to think about it.

184
00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:43.160
But he didn't do that,
that was a problem.

185
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.520
It was a stressful situation for him.

186
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.760
You're in politics for 40 years
and all of a sudden you get elected!

187
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.080
* You don't expect that.
But not in the FDP!

188
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:55.760
Yes. Yes.

189
00:10:56.520 --> 00:11:00.120
No FDP politician can
can assume that 5% in Thuringia will be enough,

190
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.520
that the CDU does not have the balls
to put one up themselves,

191
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.240
the AfD puts up one,
but does not vote for him

192
00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:11.280
and then has one vote more than
Ramelow. Is that so likely?

193
00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.800
I also have ...
You must not ask me any questions.

194
00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.600
I'll ask them myself, too.
Oh well, look somewhere else then.

195
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:23.160
Look in there if you
ask yourself a question.

196
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.480
So I think ...
Hands off the table.

197
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.200
* Laughter *

198
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.760
Yes, drink nicely from the Filly cup.

199
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:36.840
In the election campaign, your 5% man
Kemmerich was very brash and anti-AfD.

200
00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.960
We blended something in.

201
00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.040
Now comes the bald head.
Good, I have shared that.

202
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.720
Is it true that the man
runs a chain of hairdressers?

203
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.160
Yes, that's right.
For bald people?

204
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.840
I think there you can
not only get shaved.

205
00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.680
But yes, he has
a chain of hairdressers in Thuringia.

206
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.640
How does he do it?
During the day he cuts hair and ...

207
00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:03.840
No, he is the managing director.
I see. He's running things, huh? Yes.

208
00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:10.760
(sighs) Was this banter against the
the AfD a lust for power or stupidity?

209
00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.600
Can I put my hands on the table?
Yes, go ahead. Just kidding.

210
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.720
That was negligence.
You have rough hands.

211
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:22.200
Don't you put cream on?
Yes, I do, but times are hard.

212
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.360
Mmm.
* Laughter *

213
00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.640
One does with the FDP
you do a lot with your hands, don't you? Oh yes.

214
00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.520
Holding Montblancs and stuff.
(laughs) Yes. Is that difficult?

215
00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:36.280
Here, you want to look?
Yes, it's nice. Touch it.

216
00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.400
Never really worked before, huh?

217
00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.760
That's not right.
Have you ever used a hammer ...

218
00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.400
I have worked
worked in a chain factory.

219
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.320
They make bicycle chains.
That's when we hit the road.

220
00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.240
How long did you watch...
uh, work?

221
00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.800
Three summers to earn the money
for the driver's license

222
00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:58.080
or to go away for a while.
Good. Yes.

223
00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:02.080
But for a 250-page biography
is still not enough, huh?

224
00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.240
I'm working on it. Yes?
How old are you now? 31. 31.

225
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.560
That is the problem. Why?

226
00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.160
You have in every party
these old farts.

227
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.280
Now come the young people,
Philipp Amthor, for example ...

228
00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.120
He's one of the old guys.
How old is Kevin, 29? Yes, approx.

229
00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.720
You have the old bags
and now you're the young one. Relaxed.

230
00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:28.160
They have to go, don't they?
They have to go at some point.

231
00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:32.480
But you have to wait
until by some stupid coincidence

232
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.600
z. For example, falling down the stairs. The
problem is solved biologically.

233
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:38.360
They'll be gone eventually anyway.

234
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.160
But politicians live to be 100.
True.

235
00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.840
Like when you run a company with your father
run a company where you know

236
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.920
he no longer has it,
but is a managing director.

237
00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.760
Yes, a little bit.

238
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:53.040
Don't you have the feeling
that somehow... * Plopp *

239
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.040
Times to bump? And then ask:
Why are you running so fast?

240
00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.760
* Laughter *

241
00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.360
No, I'd rather not.
Isn't that right?

242
00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.040
No, but sometimes you think:
I would have done that differently.

243
00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:08.680
But that applies to older
and younger colleagues.

244
00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.440
There are older people who are closer to you
than younger people.

245
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:14.760
Sometimes the trenches
not at the age.

246
00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:19.560
It has to do with urban-rural,
with content that one makes.

247
00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.760
We will come back
to Lindner and Kemmerich.

248
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.080
Do you know what Lindner did immediately
did after Kemmerich's election? No.

249
00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.800
Maz off.

250
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.560
What did your Federal Chairman
Lindner say about the election results?

251
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.360
Has he congratulated you yet?

252
00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:39.120
He congratulated me
and wished me good nerves.

253
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.760
What are you saying?
I do not understand.

254
00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.000
At 4 p.m. at a press conference, Lindner pleaded
for new elections at a press conference.

255
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:52.120
It must have been before that.
I have seen that.

256
00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:55.240
I did not congratulate him.
I was shocked.

257
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.520
Because the line was occupied, because
Lindner congratulated him for so long?

258
00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.360
I don't think so.
How many times did you call him?

259
00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.280
Who? Kemmerich?
Kemmerich. Not at all.

260
00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.160
So not in connection
with his choice. SMS, or what?

261
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:11.640
Smiley on WhatsApp?
No, not either.

262
00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.280
Wink-wink? No.
Nothing? No.

263
00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:17.120
Fax? People have other things on their
other things on their minds,

264
00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:19.680
than to reply to
WhatsApp messages.

265
00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.960
Many in the FDP were
about this coup.

266
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.640
Hand in hand with the AfD.

267
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:27.560
As a liberal, I am glad
that after 70 years

268
00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:31.360
again have a free democratic
have a free democratic prime minister,

269
00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.920
even if the realization was
was somewhat spectacular.

270
00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.640
Kubicki then congratulated him
congratulated him very grandly.

271
00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.200
Is he crazy? Wolfgang is getting
a bit funny.

272
00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.920
* Laughter *

273
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:50.000
It's one of those things. Now
I almost tipped over the glass.

274
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.200
So he's getting weird?
Slowly, yes.

275
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.600
How. That is biological.

276
00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.080
At some point, politicians
a little funny.

277
00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:04.560
Here?
he's always had.

278
00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.880
Quirk? He always has been.
A quirk or a quirk?

279
00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:13.200
Something in the middle. A Haumacke.
Or Mackenhau. Mackenhau.

280
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:17.480
You said in my broadcast,
Mr. Kubicki has a quirk?

281
00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:23.760
Yes, a light one. It's like
"You asshole" and "You asshole."

282
00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:27.640
For "you"
there is not so much punishment.

283
00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:32.400
No, Kubicki can handle it.
Does he know he's stupid?

284
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.520
No, he's not stupid.
Is this an agreement?

285
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.360
I've learned a lot from him,
but he's getting a little weird.

286
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.440
He may be tangled up.
Yes, that's what they say.

287
00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.920
You're a little bit tangled up. Yes.
A Tüddelmaus. True.

288
00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:48.600
* Laughter *

289
00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.720
"Let him do it."
A Filly Mouse. Exactly.

290
00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.760
Do you still have something to drink?

291
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.040
Yes.
Because: From now on it costs money.

292
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.760
* Laughter *

293
00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.080
Merkel fired the east commissioner
of the German government,

294
00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:05.200
because he congratulated Kemmerich.

295
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.760
Kubicki is vice president of the Bundestag.
Why doesn't he resign?

296
00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.240
Why did CDU members have to leave?
They have nothing to do with it.

297
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.760
They voted for Kemmerich, too. AKK went
and did not prevail.

298
00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.400
Lindner drove there
and prevailed.

299
00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:23.880
No FDP member had to leave.
Kemmerich resigned.

300
00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.520
Mrs. Mutti was in Africa and
almost fell off the elephant in shock.

301
00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:31.120
She fired three people.
And with you?

302
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:35.640
Lindner said: "I'm driving
to Berlin in the golden Maybach

303
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.520
and ask for a vote of confidence."
That went well.

304
00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.640
He was shaking, wasn't he?
You could tell, couldn't you?

305
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.760
(with trembling voice) Tomorrow
I will ask for a vote of confidence.

306
00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:48.120
He realized
that it was a bullshit act

307
00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.320
and something urgently needs to be done.

308
00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:54.960
He went to Thuringia, talked
with them and Kemmerich resigned.

309
00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.760
Pretty good.

310
00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.160
What could he have ...
The shit hit the fan.

311
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.560
The child was already in the well.
What should he have done?

312
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.000
The first statement ...
Resign. Why him?

313
00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.800
Call you and say: You do it.
How sweeping.

314
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.400
A politician does something:
First resign.

315
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:18.960
And the young people who are
advocating for ecology? "Nutcases."

316
00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.880
What does that have to do with it?
"Doltish behavior."

317
00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.840
I thought:
Is he still crazy?

318
00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.920
He's got a hoe, too, hasn't he?
Tell me. No, I don't.

319
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.680
This one is also tucked away.

320
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.880
Perhaps Kubicki
infected Lindner.

321
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.840
Who knows? A virus.
He coughed in his face.

322
00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.600
Who knows what they smoke,
when they are alone. Can be.

323
00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:42.440
Why doesn't he resign?

324
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:46.160
Because that is not a value,
that people are constantly resigning.

325
00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:50.480
Yes, one wants to see then:
Blood flows and people step back.

326
00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.720
Kemmerich, who caused it,
has resigned.

327
00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.760
Shit happened. Yes.
And you apologize, or what?

328
00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:01.840
Sure, of course. He sits
on their laps:

329
00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:03.600
"Sorry for everything"?

330
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.000
Politicians rarely do that.
We apologized.

331
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.280
Don't beat around the bush:
Was crap!

332
00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:13.720
That's what he said in the Bundestag.
But that sticks.

333
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.200
Yes, something always sticks,
of course.

334
00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:22.000
Shit on the shoe sticks.
A little bit always sticks.

335
00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.440
(groans) There.

336
00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.800
You're a lawyer too, huh? Yes.

337
00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.000
A difficult candidate.
Don't know.

338
00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.400
You can speak freely.
Not everyone in politics can do that.

339
00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:37.400
I try to speak freely.

340
00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.920
Is that what you learned?
I used to do theater. Oh!

341
00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:45.240
And what is the name of the role you
today? None at all today.

342
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.680
Are you playing something for me? No.

343
00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.160
Theater? At school.
And then politics? Yes.

344
00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.440
The spectators think now,
you're just playing at it.

345
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:59.600
I did that in school.
"Yes, we apologized."

346
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:03.440
"Sorry." From now on, I'm thinking:
He's playing right now.

347
00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.440
He doesn't give a shit.
Do you believe that?

348
00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.880
"I'm sorry.
I apologize."

349
00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:14.640
So, Lindner has asked the
asked for a vote of confidence.

350
00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:17.080
How did you vote?
With yes.

351
00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:19.160
Mm.

352
00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.520
Yes. Yes, good.

353
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.360
That you trust him. Yes, I want
that he remains Federal Chairman.

354
00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:31.160
That's one of those moves
you have to make, huh?

355
00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:34.920
You need to know: What comes next?
You can not say:

356
00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.600
I tick no
and then there is no plan.

357
00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.000
It was a shitty situation,
he drove directly to Thuringia

358
00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:45.960
and made an attempt at a solution.
Then I tick yes.

359
00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.240
(whimpering) He has
the question of trust. Yes.

360
00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.640
Also an actor.

361
00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.400
Lindner's best sentence:

362
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.520
"I underestimated the ruthlessness
of the AfD."

363
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.360
I think that sentence is crap.

364
00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.240
He has been sitting for 2.5 years
next to the AfD in the Bundestag

365
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.240
and thinks to himself:
Man, these are nice neighbors.

366
00:21:05.400 --> 00:21:07.280
* Laughter *
"Completely disappointed.

367
00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.080
Completely disappointed.
And now this!

368
00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.560
Man, man, man!" * Quack *
I don't understand that sentence.

369
00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.960
The sentence is funny.

370
00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.480
It's... What do you mean, funny?
Did it go wrong or what?

371
00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:24.280
After a week, I know
that you can't trust them.

372
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.360
It takes him two years?

373
00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.600
He said it that way, yes.

374
00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:31.520
So two people are
are really out of their depth with you.

375
00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.400
No, I wouldn't say that.

376
00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.440
They're all messed up
and you are an actor.

377
00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.240
Linder says,
Bodo Ramelow should not go back on

378
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.160
and calls for
an independent head of government.

379
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.840
Mickey Mouse, Pittiplatsch?
No idea.

380
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.480
What's so bad about Ramelow? He
has ruled silently for five years.

381
00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:52.400
Two different things.

382
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:55.640
I think ... "In this office,
occupied for 20 years, is who?"

383
00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.120
"I think Ramelow."
No one noticed.

384
00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:02.600
Maybe it is not good
if no one notices a politician.

385
00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.360
I think Ramelow is
not as bad as some people,

386
00:22:06.520 --> 00:22:09.720
who carry the SED legacy
into the Left Party.

387
00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:12.840
But we must see
that in the country concerned

388
00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.640
people have a hard time with the fact that
he has people in his cabinet,

389
00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.880
who carry on this SED legacy.
But that is not my opinion.

390
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.320
My opinion is,
that this Thuringian electorate

391
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.880
must also be taken seriously as sovereigns.
Forest people? Electorate.

392
00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.880
I understood Waldvolk.
Thuringian Waldvolk.

393
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.720
There is a lot of forest. Yes.
That would have been pejorative,

394
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:38.640
if you had said: I thank
to the people of the Thuringian Forest.

395
00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:42.440
But I have not. I take care
that something like that doesn't happen.

396
00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:45.480
I don't want to get
I get into trouble with the Thuringians.

397
00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.240
Now the top of the FDP says:

398
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:49.960
We want nothing more to do with the AfD
nothing more to do with the AfD.

399
00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.240
Who should tell them that now ...

400
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:55.840
We have voted against
each of these candidates.

401
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.600
Who else is supposed to believe that?
What is the problem?

402
00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:00.680
Shit happened in Thuringia.

403
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:04.360
Many colleagues and I have been
2.5 years in the German Bundestag

404
00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:06.680
and work
against right-wing extremism.

405
00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:10.480
We just had the ban of the
right-wing extremist association Combat 18.

406
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:13.920
These are people who prefer ...
18 what? Combat 18.

407
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:17.440
An extreme right-wing association,
internationally networked,

408
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:21.720
the armed arm of associations,
which have already been banned in the past.

409
00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.840
That has now finally been done.

410
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.240
Do you know what makes your
of your party tick? Yes.

411
00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:30.800
We have prepared
prepared a diagram.

412
00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.080
Only 25% of FDP supporters

413
00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.760
find the exclusion of a
cooperation with the AfD is correct.

414
00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:42.280
75 % are open to cooperation
open. Yes. Wait ...

415
00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:47.840
Are these the figures from ZDF?
No, ARD, isn't it? This is rbb.

416
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.480
Tagesschau from 6.2.2020.

417
00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:56.320
Can I see the original graphic?
The question was asked differently.

418
00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.320
Where are we going to get them?
That is not the original question.

419
00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:03.880
Not the original graphic,
but the original figures.

420
00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:07.600
The question was: In principle
exclude or on a case-by-case basis?

421
00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.400
There was yes and no.
I am on the side of yes.

422
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:14.160
I am, after all
freely elected member of parliament.

423
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:18.480
Even if it said 0.1 and 99.9,
I wouldn't care.

424
00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:22.720
I am elected by the people and against
any cooperation with the AfD.

425
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:26.000
If my people don't want me
don't put me up for it anymore, please.

426
00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:29.120
The majority of FDP supporters
wants to get into bed with the AfD.

427
00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.240
Their Secretary General Teuteberg
was shocked by the survey.

428
00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.840
"Bad," she said.
* Laughter *

429
00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.720
That's a good thing.

430
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:41.040
As if I were a live artist
in front of 1,000 people,

431
00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:45.560
75% make the Hitler salute,
I play my program,

432
00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.280
collect the money, go to the hotel
and then say: Bad!

433
00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:51.200
* Laughter *

434
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:54.800
Isn't that so? Yes.
It's bad. Yes.

435
00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.120
We have to explain to people
what kind of troop this is,

436
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.640
that Walter Lübcke's murderer
hung up posters for the AfD,

437
00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.160
that they say about the NSU trial
that it was a show trial.

438
00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.440
We explain these facts
to people all day long.

439
00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.240
That's what we're on the road for.
That is a super important task.

440
00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.560
That is our responsibility,
when you see numbers like this.

441
00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.160
Are you up for a game?
Depends.

442
00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.120
We're going to play:
"Who said?"

443
00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:27.120
Christian Lindner has been pursuing a right-wing
a right-wing populist course for years.

444
00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:31.480
Much of what he says could also
from AfD politicians. Bullshit.

445
00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.160
* Krömer reads aloud. *

446
00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.200
AFD or Lindner?
Who said it?

447
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.040
I would say Lindner.

448
00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:49.040
We are dissolving.
Lindner said it.

449
00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.440
Yes, but...
Good, you have a point.

450
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:53.520
I was ...
A bar of chocolate.

451
00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:55.920
Second quote.
* Krömer reads aloud.

452
00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.720
Lindner or AfD?

453
00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:05.800
I don't like that sentence.
Who said it?

454
00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.880
I don't know.
I do not know.

455
00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.760
There are only two options.
Flip a coin. I do not know.

456
00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.440
Rates.

457
00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920
AfD. We dissolve.

458
00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.120
Ah, okay.

459
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:25.880
We come to the third quote.
Is it still fun? Super.

460
00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:30.120
We have 40 more questions, then we're
we're done. Okay, let's hear it.

461
00:26:30.440 --> 00:26:31.960
* Krömer reads aloud.

462
00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.400
Yes, I see it the same way.
Probably from Lindner.

463
00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:44.000
The trick is: It has always been
Lindner said. We dissolve.

464
00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.080
* (LAUGHING)
Kubicki said it.

465
00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.960
I think,
I even knew that already.

466
00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.800
Now the game is over.
But the ...

467
00:26:55.480 --> 00:27:00.600
I was not aware that such
options exist. That's funny.

468
00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.600
The random generator has
selected only FDP politicians. Yes.

469
00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:08.440
* Groan *

470
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.040
We're closing the file here.
This is how we do it.

471
00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.240
What is the color of your feeling?

472
00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.960
* Laughter *

473
00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:17.840
Magenta.

474
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:23.080
Telecom advertising still, or what?
No! Whoa. Come on, let's go outside.

475
00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:24.920
* Laughter *

476
00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.080
So.

477
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.280
Stand here.
We will now do the closing words.

478
00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.600
In the name of the people
the following judgment is rendered:

479
00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.720
Mr. Kuhle receives the maximum penalty:

480
00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.400
Life FDP.

481
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:44.040
* Laughter *

482
00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.520
Take care, neighbors.
Bye.

483
00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.400
* Music *
* Applause *
