00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.320
.

2
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.480
(Breathe very calmly.

3
00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.200
A ...

4
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.240
and also from.

5
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.600
Do not try to
organize your thoughts.

6
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.800
Just let them go

7
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.560
and take a deep breath ...

8
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.240
a ...

9
00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.240
and from.

10
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.720
*deep breath*

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.800
And when I say "now",
you will open your eyes.

12
00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360
*hit*
Now!

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800
Shh, shh ...

14
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.800
Yes, close your eyes
closed again.

15
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.000
Good, good.

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.280
And now go twice as deep
into your relaxation as before.

17
00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.640
Take your time.

18
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.600
*exciting music*

19
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.840
I'll take you back now.

20
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.840
To the source.

21
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.800
To the source of your fear.

22
00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.920
*exciting music*

23
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.520
I ... will guide you.

24
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.560
Step by step.

25
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.800
Step by step.

26
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.200
All the way to the source of your fear.

27
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400
All the way to the truth.

28
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.400
*exciting music*

29
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.960
You are in Cologne,
in your home town.

30
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.240
It's the summer,
just before you move in.

31
00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:54.640
*exciting music*

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.400
There's your father.

33
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
You long so much,
to go to war.

34
00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.240
You are dying to
to finally leave here,

35
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.560
to leave everything behind you.

36
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.760
There's the woman you love.

37
00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.960
But there is something,
that separates you from her.

38
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.640
*He breathes frantically.

39
00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.640
*threatening music

40
00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.880
*uncanny music

41
00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.920
*rhythmic music

42
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.480
*Rattling of a train

43
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.480
*Tuten*

44
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.760
*shrill brakes*

45
00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.400
*You speak Russian.

46
00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.120
(What do they want? Ah!

47
00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.200
(with accent) Clothes!
- Don't hurt us.

48
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.360
Don't worry. Your clothes!
Uniform, then no harm done.

49
00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.920
Will do nothing, just clothes.

50
00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.480
*Man cries out.

51
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:25.360
*exciting music*

52
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.880
*exciting music*

53
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.840
*whistle*

54
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.760
*hiss*

55
00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:36.920
*shot*

56
00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.240
*strumming

57
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.560
*He exhales deeply.

58
00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.400
Do you have a quick Otto,
or what?

59
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:56.480
*distant, muffled voices*

60
00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.160
(quietly) It's packed in there.

61
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.320
Yes, go for it!

62
00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:16.800
*Music, someone is speaking.

63
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.880
(With a chaste look,
here, where the little bird is.

64
00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.640
And now the Archangel Gabriel,
please.

65
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:26.760
Maria, now turn
a little bit!

66
00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.400
I can't see anything.
Over even more!

67
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.640
Frieda, you are just receiving
the Savior, I see nothing of that!

68
00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:36.280
*Groans*

69
00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:40.520
Now hit the drum a little
on the drum! Paul, faster!

70
00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.240
*Groans*

71
00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:48.480
Why don't you turn around a bit?
I can't see anything.

72
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.440
*Rumbles*

73
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.920
Vice squad! Removal!
End of the event!

74
00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.320
So, ladies and gentlemen,
everyone line up!

75
00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.760
The genitals collected
and shut up!

76
00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.560
Everything must be included.

77
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.560
Every photo, every movie,
every can, everything.

78
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.760
Take over, Jänicke.

79
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.560
No detail should be
be lost.

80
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.600
(Hop, hop!

81
00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:21.320
Pack everything up
and into the car!

82
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.760
Who are you?
The carpenter.

83
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.760
Who would that be?
Well, the father of Jesus.

84
00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.280
Take a look,
God is playing along here too.

85
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.960
The Virgin Mary,
fair boy in curly hair ...

86
00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.600
They are all here.

87
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.120
Mr. König.

88
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.160
Paragraph 118: Art is free.

89
00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.520
Prove to me
that I am not an artist.

90
00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.560
You're a rat.
And you're a blowfly.

91
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:48.880
I'll never get rid of you.
Too much shit sticks to you.

92
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.480
No offense intended,

93
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:06.800
but we can't let something like that
not be allowed to pass here.

94
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.560
*Rumbles, laughs

95
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:11.760
We are not finished here yet.

96
00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.160
*He sighs.

97
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.760
*exciting music*

98
00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.600
(Man, in the background)
Won't be long now.

99
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:39.520
They're almost finished
with the holy couple.

100
00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.200
Good, handsome.

101
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.400
Closing time.

102
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.720
I know you.

103
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.600
*driving music

104
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.600
*He whistles.
Get everyone out!

105
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.800
*shouts in the background

106
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.600
*fast music

107
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.400
Come out!

108
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:57.720
You shoot me up here
and let me put you away downstairs?

109
00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.480
The fat bastard won't get me.
You bet.

110
00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.920
He does NOT have a toy gun.

111
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.280
Toys?

112
00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.720
Thank you.

113
00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:28.480
Maybe you do it differently
differently in Cologne,

114
00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:31.680
but here in the capital
it's quite good,

115
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.120
to be the first to draw his weapon.

116
00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.520
Yes, unfortunately
landed back there in the shaft.

117
00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.400
(laughs) Ah.

118
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.560
I'll tell Willy.
You'll have it back tomorrow.

119
00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.600
So, you tie,
now say thank you.

120
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480
What?

121
00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.680
I don't hear anything.

122
00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:57.000
Thank you.

123
00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.280
Do you know what for?

124
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.240
Because I have just
from that,

125
00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:06.000
a head shorter
to be made a head shorter.

126
00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.920
You have only
attempted police murder

127
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:11.960
and the messes there
on the cheek.

128
00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.880
I don't have anything ...

129
00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:16.400
You talk when I ask you.

130
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:17.680
(But ...

131
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.960
*He sighs.

132
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.840
Perhaps the bullet
was not fired at all.

133
00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.640
And somehow ...
you got away from us up here.

134
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.200
You know that, don't you?

135
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.640
So.

136
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:36.400
Now introduce yourself
to my colleague in Cologne.

137
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.800
Name?
Krajewski.

138
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.480
(loudly) Excuse me?
Krajewski, Franz.

139
00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:42.160
Rank, regiment?

140
00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.800
Private, Infantry,
second Hanseatic, Ww...

141
00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.320
Excuse me?
(stammers) Western front.

142
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.760
Resident?
In the ruins at Hermannplatz.

143
00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:54.000
Oh, then everything is clear.

144
00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.680
Now pay attention.

145
00:12:56.920 --> 00:13:01.120
Erwin from the kiosk in the subway station,
that's our man.

146
00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.920
Point twelve
you get in touch with him.

147
00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:06.680
And then when we ask you
ask you a question,

148
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.600
then you have an answer.

149
00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.840
Oh come on, Fluttershy,
pull yourself together!

150
00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:25.480
*Birds chirping

151
00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.880
*quiet music

152
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.240
*quiet music

153
00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.880
*A baby cries.

154
00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.400
Where is Lotte?

155
00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:14.320
*Baby cries, man snores.

156
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.800
*cough*

157
00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:30.480
*He mumbles to himself.

158
00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.280
(Lotte?

159
00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.800
Where have you been?

160
00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.800
Everywhere.

161
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:49.400
Didn't sleep at all?

162
00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Nope.

163
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.800
And straight back to work?
How do you always manage that?

164
00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.560
Well, you know that:
If you sleep, you miss being awake.

165
00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:00.720
And I have to be careful.

166
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:05.960
And here like this?

167
00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:08.320
Paradise.

168
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.000
*Music from outside*

169
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:20.600
Leopold.

170
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.640
# Your eyes are magnets

171
00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.480
and they shine
like the stars. #

172
00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.800
(they sing)
"Your kisses connecting wires

173
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.520
between earth
and the kingdom of heaven."

174
00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.360
"A little bit of technology,
a little love,

175
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.720
a little pleasure
and a little pain

176
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.560
are the motor in the gearbox

177
00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.800
and the stupid heart is busy."

178
00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.600
Left pocket.

179
00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.560
Did you bring anything?

180
00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.400
Yellow!

181
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.400
I haven't got them yet.

182
00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:16.520
What is this?

183
00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.400
Nothing, just a bruise.

184
00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:25.960
Can you bring me
bring me my stockings?

185
00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.600
The fine ones, please.

186
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.400
It's not so bad, Toni.

187
00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:40.600
What's with the fucking noise?
Where's the rent?

188
00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.560
It's on the table.
Nope.

189
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.000
Half of it is missing.

190
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:46.760
I'll have it by tonight.
Watch out!

191
00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.760
(laughs) Who can
piss with a latte?

192
00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.720
Why don't you touch it?

193
00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.320
Oh, you bastard!

194
00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.640
Lotte!

195
00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:04.760
Lotte!

196
00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.800
We need 20.

197
00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.960
Schrödern is kicking us out.
Tonight, I promise.

198
00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.520
(Lotte!

199
00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.240
*calm, serious music

200
00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.480
*Music gets faster.

201
00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:55.360
*moving music

202
00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.520
Here: a little reminder of your
exciting time in the capital.

203
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.840
How do you know this man?

204
00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:11.160
Krajewski?

205
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:15.320
Believe it or not:
He used to be with us.

206
00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.560
A policeman.

207
00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.520
Thought seriously,
after the war

208
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.520
as normal
back into service.

209
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:23.880
As a trembler.

210
00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.120
One day he is called into action,
There's a big shoot-out,

211
00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.640
and the rug rat
can't get his head around it.

212
00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.560
That's when we kicked him out.
Without honor.

213
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.960
*crowing horn*

214
00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.520
Yes, now make way,
you horndog!

215
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.560
*moving music

216
00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:04.960
Leave it alone!

217
00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.680
(singing) O peace, where art thou?
O peace, where art thou?

218
00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160
Stop it!

219
00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:16.680
I'm going to the police, no lie.

220
00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.120
Do you want to come?

221
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.480
*moving music

222
00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:31.280
At the front, they folded in rows
the flappers have buckled.

223
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.120
Now you only need to
just blow hard,

224
00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:35.880
and the tap opens.

225
00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:38.400
I took part in Belgium.

226
00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:40.480
And France.

227
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:43.720
And you?

228
00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:45.760
Only the end game.

229
00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.440
The Siegfried Line.

230
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.440
These are broken vending machines,
nothing else.

231
00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:57.440
Broken vending machines
belong in the trash.

232
00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.920
Probably.

233
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:21.800
Tomorrow.
Sorry?

234
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.880
*murmur of voices*

235
00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.920
Sorry, we're waiting too!

236
00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.720
Hey there, knight, I've been waiting
for an hour too!

237
00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:37.920
Chewing gum?
I'll take it. Thanks to you.

238
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:40.120
Has old Reckwitz been there yet?

239
00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.240
(all) Morning, Mr. Government Councillor.
- Once. It's a lousy day.

240
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.640
*Lotte sighs.

241
00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.880
Hello.

242
00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.400
Hello.

243
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.360
Morning, Jänicke.
- Morning, Mr. Gräf.

244
00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.440
Already so packed so early?
- Morning, girls!

245
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.160
(all) Morning, Chief Superintendent!

246
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.400
Who's the cute guy?

247
00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:06.960
Morning, ladies.
- (all) Good morning!

248
00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.520
We need twelve transcripts ...

249
00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.160
Here!
- Me!

250
00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:14.680
37 Determination notices
for the B.

251
00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:15.960
Here!
- Me!

252
00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.680
Me! Thank you.
- 90 summonses for the H.

253
00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.520
Yes, well ...

254
00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.360
Which of you can ...
Me!

255
00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:25.560
French?

256
00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.800
Miss Amelie, of course.
- Thank you.

257
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.640
So, ladies,
that's it for now.

258
00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:33.480
*disappointed murmur*

259
00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.840
You can wait,
but there's not much more to come.

260
00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:38.160
Traudel?

261
00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:41.720
See you tomorrow.

262
00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.280
Oh yes, there's one more thing.
*excited murmur*

263
00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:49.520
The cataloging for
the photo archive of the Homicide Inspectorate.

264
00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.520
The lady with the green hat.

265
00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:53.400
You!
- Thank you.

266
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.800
Miss Ritter ...

267
00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.200
*disappointed murmur*

268
00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.160
The Buddha wants ...
Who?

269
00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.680
Gennat, the head of the homicide department.
He wants to set up a register.

270
00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:10.240
With description of all murders
of the last 13 years:

271
00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:13.240
Place of discovery, murder weapon,
Condition of the body ...

272
00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:15.680
The whole shebang.
And I'm supposed to ...

273
00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.840
You describe what you see.
And you do so systematically.

274
00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:24.200
For example here: Axe murder,
split skull, amputation.

275
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.880
The pictures are organized
organized by case.

276
00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.720
There is always a date
and case number.

277
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.400
Keyword register.
Correct.

278
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:37.000
You will find similarities,
z. e.g. the same murder weapon.

279
00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:39.480
And the pictures
were all taken by you?

280
00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.840
There are three times as many at the top.

281
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.880
A mark an hour,
I'll sign the note tomorrow.

282
00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:48.400
Thank you.
 Mhm.

283
00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.000
You actually know,

284
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.280
what the good inspector Rath
has collected about you,

285
00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:05.120
the last few weeks,
since you left Cologne?

286
00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.640
Let's talk about him.

287
00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:15.120
Let's hear it.

288
00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:17.160
What kind is that?

289
00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.640
You want me to tell you something
about your colleague?

290
00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.240
He knows you,
so you know him.

291
00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:29.640
What's in it for me?

292
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.480
Whew ...

293
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.120
For you?

294
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.200
Kiss.

295
00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.800
Wait a minute.

296
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.680
You've got something there.

297
00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.680
Come on, fire away.

298
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:56.880
His father is the right-hand man
of the Lord Mayor of Cologne,

299
00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.400
'A big shot in the police force.

300
00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.520
I know, man.

301
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.000
He is ambitious,

302
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.440
dogged, 'a ferret.

303
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.280
I know.

304
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.120
Go to church, pray,
believe in the good Lord.

305
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.800
Yes, I know, I know,
I know everything!

306
00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:18.360
But what don't I know?

307
00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:23.480
How am I supposed to know what you
don't know, Mr. Chief Commissioner?

308
00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:27.880
Why is he with Vice?

309
00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.520
What?
Why not something decent?

310
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:33.480
Murder, corruption, secret police?

311
00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.160
Mr. Commissioner?
 Mhm.

312
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.480
The interrogation transcripts.
Thank you.

313
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.400
Is there anything else I can do?
Thank you.

314
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.000
Oh yes ...
Where is Wolter?

315
00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.520
He interrogates King.

316
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:55.400
What?

317
00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:58.360
*King screams.
What do you want?

318
00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:02.000
I want to know
what's going on between you two.

319
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.400
*King screams.
And what he wants from you.

320
00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:08.840
He's not just here
just because of your muckraking.

321
00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.200
He's a Catholic.
They don't like that sort of thing.

322
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.920
*Wolter sighs.

323
00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:21.520
Man, man, man!

324
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:25.320
You're practically begging for it,
officially tonight

325
00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.480
as a child fucker
in the slammer.

326
00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.400
You have no idea,
who you're dealing with.

327
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:35.480
Who are you talking about?

328
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.360
Gereon Rath?

329
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.800
Oh. We were just
talking about you.

330
00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:48.480
*King screams.

331
00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:49.960
It's good that you're here.

332
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:53.200
I was just about to
short for little boys.

333
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.320
I'll do it here.

334
00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:07.640
You know what I'm looking for.

335
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:12.520
Where is the movie?

336
00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:16.240
Why don't you just tell him
that he should pay.

337
00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:20.200
He won't pay.
That's why I'm here.

338
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.240
He will pay.

339
00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.240
Call a paramedic.

340
00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480
Yes.

341
00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.480
And let ME know,

342
00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.160
when he is
is fit for questioning again.

343
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:40.920
*exciting music*

344
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.760
Franz.

345
00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.600
How are you doing?

346
00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.600
Would you like to try again
with us?

347
00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.840
Please, yes.

348
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.360
Away from drugs?

349
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.840
No, doctor.
But I ...

350
00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:21.160
Those are the rules, Franz.

351
00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.880
We got busted this morning.

352
00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:30.440
And?

353
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.160
They have a king.

354
00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:36.000
He didn't destroy the movie.

355
00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.600
Why not?

356
00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.120
That was
my clear instruction.

357
00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:44.600
He tried to
to make a mark with it.

358
00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:47.800
On your own.

359
00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:50.440
*A clock is ticking.

360
00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.680
That's not good, Franz.

361
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.120
*exciting music*

362
00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.000
Stop!

363
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.800
What have you loaded? In there?
- (with accent) All pesticide.

364
00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:31.480
Papers!
- What?

365
00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:34.520
I have to check the freight documents
check the shipping documents.

366
00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.840
Yes, yes.

367
00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.920
Reichswehr.

368
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.960
What's going on?
Why is the train stopped?

369
00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:13.880
We control.

370
00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.520
Let the train pass!
- Our regulations ...

371
00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.280
The train runs on behalf
of the Reichswehr.

372
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:23.600
But someone has to
sign the shipping documents.

373
00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:34.640
I need
the full name.

374
00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.280
This is Major General Seegers.

375
00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:52.600
Have a good trip!

376
00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.280
*threatening music

377
00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.800
*electronic beeping*

378
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.840
*She types.

379
00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:34.920
Nadia.

380
00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:45.520
*uncanny music

381
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.720
*exciting music*

382
00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:12.120
*You speak Russian.

383
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:36.160
Alexsej.

384
00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.400
*shrill, whistling music*

385
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.120
*Sizzle

386
00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.880
*shrill, whistling music*

387
00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:21.520
That's not typical.
Sandor is never late.

388
00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.800
Times are changing.

389
00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.240
Hm. What does that mean?

390
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:37.640
That your brother's reliability
of your brother has diminished.

391
00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.400
More precise, please.

392
00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:42.280
They supply us with
35,000 bottles of arrack a year.

393
00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.800
I supply the whole city with it.
You keep quiet.

394
00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.560
I pay you well.
We could all be happy.

395
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.400
But?

396
00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.760
There were complaints
about the quality of the alcohol.

397
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
More and more often.

398
00:32:57.240 --> 00:33:00.120
I have had an examination
had an examination done

399
00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.800
and made an interesting discovery
made.

400
00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:06.200
I don't drink arrack
with the octopus.

401
00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.920
*exciting music*

402
00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400
Yes.

403
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.800
The good, honest
and very punctual Sandor

404
00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.480
has simply swapped your fine brew
with cheap booze.

405
00:33:32.360 --> 00:33:35.160
Did he think
I wouldn't notice?

406
00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.720
Did he believe that the fine
tongues of our guests fail?

407
00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.240
*Violin sounds displace the
the suspenseful music.

408
00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:46.760
Although the tongue is the most sensitive

409
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:51.200
and best supplied with blood
organ of perception in humans.

410
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.440
Where is Sandor?

411
00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.120
What kind of nonsense is that?

412
00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.240
Mr. Kardakov, please!

413
00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:05.960
One, two, one, two, three!

414
00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.960
*swinging music*
Thank you.

415
00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:17.720
The tongue is unique,
a small miracle of nature.

416
00:34:17.960 --> 00:34:20.920
Which is why it is
is itself a delicacy.

417
00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.640
Where is my brother?

418
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Hm.

419
00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:50.400
Enjoy your octopus,
Mr. Gosztony.

420
00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.440
*cheerful swing music*

421
00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.240
(Doctor.

422
00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:13.280
I don't want to waste your precious time
unnecessarily.

423
00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:15.720
Please.
How can I help?

424
00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.560
Our mutual friend does business
business on his own account.

425
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.280
King?

426
00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:23.840
King.

427
00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:27.400
He has a movie
aside.

428
00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.160
The man is jeopardizing
our entire operation.

429
00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.400
I'll take care of it.

430
00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:35.640
Good.

431
00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.880
*exciting music*

432
00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.160
*exciting music*

433
00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.360
Well, you hard-working Hannes.

434
00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.200
A beer at the end of the day?

435
00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:49.800
I still have work to do.

436
00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:54.000
As you wish.
See you tomorrow then.

437
00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.320
Tell me, Bruno?

438
00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.400
Why did you
started without me?

439
00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:05.400
Sometimes that's better.

440
00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:07.840
Tomorrow we'll do it the other way around.

441
00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.320
Fine by me.

442
00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.360
Here is the file
for your interrogation.

443
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.160

446
00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.960
Closing time.

447
00:38:02.640 --> 00:38:04.840
Sorry!
 Excuse me!

448
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.760
I think this is yours.

449
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.400
Yes, thank you.

450
00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:19.360
This is probably yours.

451
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.760
That should be yours.
Oh yes, thank you very much.

452
00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.640
I hope you are of the custom.

453
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:36.200
And I hope so,
You are from the murder.

454
00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.400
Goodbye.

Good evening, Mr. Rath.
Good evening, Mr. Rath.

458
00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.280
I have some mail for you.

459
00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:29.000
I have to extend my stay
extend my stay after all. Thank you.

460
00:39:29.240 --> 00:39:32.400
You were leaving tomorrow, weren't you?
That's right.

461
00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.320
Tomorrow a
trade union group from Leverkusen.

462
00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:39.800
May 1st,
day of struggle of the working class.

463
00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:41.280
I also use the broom cupboard.

464
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.560
Unfortunately we are
fully booked until the weekend.

465
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.880
Thank you.

((Mrs.) My dearest Gereon,

468
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:55.400
As of today it is
exactly four weeks,

469
00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:57.400
that you are already gone
from Cologne.

470
00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:00.240
It's starting to feel like
like back then,

471
00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:02.880
when you and your brother
went to war

472
00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.800
and the days gradually
became longer and longer.

473
00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.600
Your letter said
that the case is almost solved.

474
00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.880
That gives me no peace.
Please be careful.

475
00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:16.440
The Berlin pavement is
rougher than anywhere else in the Reich.

476
00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:19.600
Even though I know
that you'll be back soon,

477
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:23.400
I cannot hide the fact
that my heart is sinking,

478
00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:26.160
in the evening
turn off the light

479
00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:30.360
and seek to wrest a little more
of his grace,

480
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.760
that nothing may happen to you
in this big, strange city.

481
00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.880
Greetings and kisses
from your Helga.

to the capital of the empire).

485
00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.920
Shorts to go with it?

486
00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:29.000
