00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480
.

2
00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.320
* Music *

3
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.080
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

4
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.800
Prince Marcus
Eberhardt Edward von Anhalt,

5
00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.560
Duke of Saxony and Westphalia,
Count of Ascania.

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.240
* Audience laughs. *

7
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.040
* Laughter *

8
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.360
Is someone behind me making faxes?

9
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.160
* Laughter *

10
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.600
53 years old,
has, according to his own statements

11
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.080
a three-digit
million amount in the account.

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.080
Uh... Hello?

13
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.920
* Laughter *

14
00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.320
Must I now always address you
address you as Your Royal Highness

15
00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.520
or would Prince Marcus do?

16
00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.520
Prince Marcus will do.

17
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.880
That would be enough?
Enough.

18
00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.360
Or if I say, for example.
Prince Carnival? * Laughter *

19
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.160
I am not.

20
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.440
All right, I'll come in.
Are you sitting down? Yes.

21
00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.320
So from the conversation ...

22
00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.320
Maybe the answer later
a little longer.

23
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.040
* Laughter *

24
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.200
"Yes, no" sucks.

25
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.960
Last week we had a guest,
was great.

26
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.480
Next week will be great too.
* Laughter *

27
00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.240
Today is just ...
with a view to the check.

28
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.080
There are days like that, too, friends.

29
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.760
* Laughter *

30
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.720
So, alaaf, I'm coming in.
* Laughter *

31
00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.800
* Hum goes on and off. *

32
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.120
* Hum *
* Laughter *

33
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.960
We haven't had that yet either.
* So.

34
00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.840
Moin. Moin, good day.

35
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.920
Remain seated.
Do not touch. * Laughter *

36
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.480
So, Mr. Marcus.
Prince ...

37
00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.320
Do you always have to
pronounce the whole name?

38
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.640
You should,
but you don't have to.

39
00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.080
Cascania? Ascania.
Where is Ascania?

40
00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.760
Between Germany
and the Czech Republic.

41
00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.040
Do you own the land?
No, unfortunately, not anymore.

42
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.920
So, Mr. von Anhalt.

43
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.760
Lord of Prince
of Anhalt of Ascania.

44
00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.120
You must omit "lord".
Lord or prince. Lord of Anhalt.

45
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.240
Yes, Mr. von Anhalt.

46
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.720
All they really talk about is money,
huh? Also.

47
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.000
Are you afraid of kidnapping,
if you always talk about money?

48
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:55.040
No, nobody kidnaps me.

49
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.680
Because nobody wants you?
* (LAUGHING)

50
00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.800
No, nobody kidnaps me.

51
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.760
Isn't that so,
when you say "I have a lot of money.

52
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.320
Look,
a photo of my money!",

53
00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.320
that there will be a burglary?
There is no crime in Dubai.

54
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.160
We'll get to that in a minute.
You live in Dubai. Yes.

55
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.680
Are you mouthy? No.
* (LAUGHING)

56
00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.400
I still need to warm up.

57
00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.080
Have you just come from Dubai?
From L.A. That wasn't the question.

58
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.240
Do you want people to love you
because you supposedly have a lot of money?

59
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.480
That has nothing to do with it.
No? No.

60
00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.680
Why?
Because it has nothing to do with that.

61
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.480
If people love me,
it's because of my character.

62
00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.000
Do you have character?
I think so.

63
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.160
A flexible character?
That too.

64
00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.600
I have a good character.
Yes? Yes.

65
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:46.480
It makes your nose grow longer, doesn't it?
* (LAUGHING)

66
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.680
No.
Prince Pinocchio, or what?

67
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.280
Good.

68
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.920
Why do you always have to
always have to flaunt it like that?

69
00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.360
Do you have to compensate
compensate something?

70
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.080
Was there something wrong
something wrong?

71
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.320
Is that a shrinking dick,
that is overplayed?

72
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.760
What is it?
I have ...

73
00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.760
I like to show what I have and
like to be an example for others,

74
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.560
that they also earn money.

75
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.200
That they then also splurge?
Showing off is cool.

76
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.600
You like to show off. How do you show
your money without showing it off?

77
00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.800
Do you do it just for showing off?
No, to be an example.

78
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.360
A good role model. Exactly.

79
00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.440
Earn money and flaunt it.
That you can do that. Flaunt?

80
00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.960
In America, this is called
the American Dream.

81
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.280
Here in Germany
that has atrophied.

82
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.280
They also like to flaunt
on social media. But full.

83
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.280
Horny tablecloth.
"Lunch. Who else is hungry?"

84
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.040
How much coal do you see there?
How much was that?

85
00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.720
I think,
it was around 50,000.

86
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.200
Is that what you spend during the day?
Depends.

87
00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.440
There are days
when I spend that.

88
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.320
Not today. Not today.

89
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:13.480
What did you spend today?
400 euros.

90
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.640
* Laughter *

91
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.600
So you were
just at home all day?

92
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.200
I got up at two.
Thrown out of the window?

93
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.200
I bought shoes. Out of boredom
400 euros thrown out the window?

94
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.880
No. No?
No. Disappeared, eaten up?

95
00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.840
No, I bought shoes.
At home?

96
00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.200
No, on the Ku'damm.

97
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.040
Ku'damm, is here. Yes.
Yes, I know it.

98
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.240
But you share not only
the sunny side of your life,

99
00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.000
but also the downsides.
Which are?

100
00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:46.440
We have prepared this.
* Laughter *

101
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.440
I wanted to pay for my ticket
cash at the airport counter.

102
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.200
They don't take 500s.

103
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:57.160
I went to the exchange office,
want to change 500s.

104
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.560
The first does not do it, the second
says "We don't have that much money,

105
00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.520
but we take 5 euros per 500 euros,
that you change."

106
00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.480
In Euro! So, change Euro into Euro
also already costs money.

107
00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.480
I could have them...
And now I have no one at all.

108
00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.960
It pisses me off.

109
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.240
Yes. You know how it is.
The money is no longer worth anything.

110
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.440
You want to go to Qatar and then something like this.
Exactly.

111
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.360
Was there still a resolution
or did you say:

112
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.080
"Fuck it, I'm going
to Timmendorfer Strand"?

113
00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.160
No, I have used
used the credit card. Yes? Yes.

114
00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.560
If you have a lot of money with you
and can't get rid of it beforehand,

115
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.800
you have to register it, fill out forms
and that's no fun.

116
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.120
That's a stressful situation, isn't it?
Exactly. Man.

117
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:50.640
It's better to spend the money beforehand.

118
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.880
The whole day is probably fucked.
After ten minutes it works again.

119
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:59.520
You have a lot of money and at some point you're
pissed off, right? Not me.

120
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.640
And let's put it this way ...

121
00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.160
Why don't you do something
something interesting with the money?

122
00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.960
For example? I have seen,
you buy watches.

123
00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.640
Then you have
a watch for 250,000 euros.

124
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.480
The next day
you buy one for 400,000 euros

125
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.120
and then one for 1 million

126
00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:25.240
Then you buy a car
and Wednesday is clock day again.

127
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.560
On Thursday again a car
and then another watch for 0.25 million.

128
00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:34.280
If I had so much money,
I would buy... a Stradivarius.

129
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.920
Not my cup of tea.

130
00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.360
Just to be able to buy them.
I can't even play the violin.

131
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.520
"Look, honey,
"Look, honey, what I'm making out of the bag.

132
00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:45.640
a Stradivarius!"
You can throw it away again.

133
00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.120
I miss the reference. Something else?
I don't throw anything away.

134
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.920
Or slap a team of archaeologists
10 million euros on the table and say:

135
00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:55.960
"Look for the Amber Room."

136
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.960
They're looking for a long time.
I don't care.

137
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:04.920
Then you hit again ... The money
should become more. Or Atlantis.

138
00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.640
Let's see,
if the place down there is still wet.

139
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.640
* You know?
Imagine finding Atlantis.

140
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.760
You really put your money where your mouth is

141
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.600
and can then
full jerk off on it.

142
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:20.360
I am not a dreamer.
But you buy a watch.

143
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.280
Yes. I am not a dreamer.

144
00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.600
"I'm not a dreamer." No.

145
00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.440
Is that a promo for your new CD?
* (LAUGHING)

146
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.560
No, I don't have to
Atlantis to search.

147
00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:32.520
I don't need a Stradivarius,

148
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:35.400
because I have no
to classical music.

149
00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.680
I can't play the violin.
Buy yourself an electric guitar.

150
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.960
I have. From Keith Richard.
I have.

151
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.680
You already have it? Yes.

152
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.880
But watches are your thing.
How many do you have? 140.

153
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.400
Well, eventually you'll have 1,000.
There won't be that many more.

154
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.280
I also sell once again a
for a new one.

155
00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:57.120
Depending on what is popular.

156
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.080
It's boring.
What kind of watch is that?

157
00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.960
The. A Richard Mill.

158
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.280
How much is it? 250.000.

159
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:10.480
Mine here costs 52 euros.
This is a quartz watch.

160
00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.320
Please turn on
start the stopwatch.

161
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.640
Yes, hold on. Here.

162
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:20.120
Do you have light? No.
It doesn't even have a light.

163
00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.920
I have that on my phone.

164
00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.960
You need to get your phone
and light up your watch with it?

165
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.280
There is a stopwatch in my phone.

166
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.720
That's why you have the watch.
What? No.

167
00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.680
250,000 euros
and does not even have light?

168
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.760
What if you were to...
* (LAUGHING)

169
00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:39.440
You go down to the basement
and it's a power outage. Yes.

170
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.880
Then you walk
around the house like an idiot,

171
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.800
shine the light on your watch and say:
"Half past seven already."

172
00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.720
I don't have a basement. Never mind.

173
00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:52.520
It does matter. Everybody does
with his money what he wants.

174
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.160
Go ahead and make your clocks.

175
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.080
They live in Dubai most of the time.

176
00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.560
Did you move there because they have
more understanding for the rich,

177
00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.040
have the 2,000 euros in cash with you?

178
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.360
I moved there,
because the weather is nicer and...

179
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.720
Wait, I'll write that down.

180
00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.480
And because there is no envy.

181
00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.880
But that's...
Isn't that for you ...

182
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.800
After all, there are billionaires in Dubai.
Yes, that is an incentive.

183
00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:24.000
There you are nothing more.
A small number.

184
00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.240
There you are Prince Booger. Yes.

185
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.480
Are they laughing at you? No.

186
00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.640
How much do you have in the account?

187
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.480
Do I have to say that? Three-digit
million. Yes, that's enough.

188
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:40.880
100,000 million. Let's say,
there is a sheikh with 8 billion

189
00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.480
Yes, a friend of mine.
How do they deal with you?

190
00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.960
This is a friend of mine.
Do they push you then?

191
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:51.320
No, they are nice.
Do they spit at you? No.

192
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:53.760
They invite me.
They're inviting you?

193
00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.080
Why? Let me guess, because of your
character? Because they like me.

194
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:01.080
Because of your character.
Because I am a nice guy.

195
00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:03.640
I am incredibly nice.

196
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.000
But you are poor for them.
Do you get complexes there?

197
00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.760
I also hang out with people ...
They say, "No, him again!

198
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.320
It only has 140 watches." Yes.
* (LAUGHING)

199
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:15.880
You know? It's like this. No.

200
00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:19.960
I also meet with people who
have only 2 watches. I would not.

201
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.080
But I am nice
and you probably are not.

202
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:26.200
No, I have a watch...
This is not a watch.

203
00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:29.640
I also meet people.
After all, it's 100 years old.

204
00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.840
This is 100 years old.
A rarity.

205
00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.440
Do you know how much it's worth?
An expensive classic car?

206
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.800
250,000 euros,
because it's so old. Wow.

207
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:43.880
No, I... Do you want me to tell you
what my most expensive watch is? No.

208
00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.280
I don't want to know. I don't care.
I don't want to know.

209
00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:48.960
Aaah ...

210
00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.840
Then I won't tell you. Good.

211
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.280
So, the title of prince
you have bought yourself. That's what they say.

212
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:03.000
How big is actually the crack,
it takes to do this,

213
00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.560
to buy this prince title?

214
00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.360
That was one of the best decisions
of my life.

215
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.160
Of course you are not a prince.
I am a prince.

216
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.160
You are a prince, yes.
* (LAUGHING)

217
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:17.520
Do you have pee in your eyes now?
* Wait.

218
00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.720
You have a business card, sure.
I have too.

219
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.680
Do you want to distrust the German state?

220
00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.880
So, what does it say?
Prince of Anhalt.

221
00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:34.360
Yeah, sure. What's your name? Adolf?
Marcus Frank Adolf.

222
00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:40.440
How do I hold this,
for everyone to see? * (LAUGHING)

223
00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.680
Is there anything I need to cover? Never mind,
the door is open for the prince.

224
00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.480
Exactly.
* (LAUGHING)

225
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:54.560
Clearly, that's what it says.
Why is that clear?

226
00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.800
My name is Kurt Krömer,
cost me a tenner.

227
00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:00.160
That's also what it says on the ID card.
Yes?

228
00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:05.400
You can apply for anything.
But why buy the title?

229
00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.480
That was...
You have a romantic streak, don't you?

230
00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.960
You've been watching princess movies.
My daughter is a princess.

231
00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:21.040
It's nice.
So, and that was Frederic from ...

232
00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.960
My father. The father?
The adoptive father, Frederic.

233
00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:27.120
He adopted you. That's right.
Out of love, I suppose.

234
00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.320
No, because we
got along well.

235
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.160
Let me guess: It was not
about money. That was the headline.

236
00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.440
That's how it all started.
He adopted you for nothing.

237
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.680
"You want to give me 1 million?
No, my son!

238
00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:44.560
I'm adopting you like this.
Do you have any ID with you?"

239
00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:47.520
It was not free,
but free of charge.

240
00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:49.640
We'll take a look,

241
00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.640
whether you, as a prince, have remained
have remained on the carpet.

242
00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:56.240
Your opinion about homeless people.
MAZ off.

243
00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:59.640
No one has to suffer hardship,
sleep under the bridge.

244
00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.240
It is one's own will,
when you give yourself up.

245
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.680
People who have no self-confidence
have no energy

246
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.760
and no commitment to take care
from the state to take care of it,

247
00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.120
that they are better off,
have only themselves to blame.

248
00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.600
Then let them die,
I don't care.

249
00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.800
My opinion. Insult,
but want to be loved?

250
00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:26.400
Wait a minute,
the program is called "Pulse 180".

251
00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.240
Thanks to me, it had
3.5 million viewers. Yes.

252
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:35.240
It was about rich meets poor,
swapping lives for a day.

253
00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.800
I got to know the man better later
and he wanted it that way.

254
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:44.920
After 20 years, he
was a full-blooded alcoholic.

255
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.400
Today he lives a normal,
healthy life

256
00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.720
and no longer sleeps under the
Bridge, but has taken 20 years.

257
00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.720
I was puzzled by that.

258
00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:56.600
If you do not
want to sleep under the bridge,

259
00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:01.880
you don't have to do that in Germany.
Are they all stupid, or what?

260
00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:04.440
I also know homeless people in LA,

261
00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:08.400
who do not have to sleep under the bridge
but do it anyway,

262
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.000
because they have a community there.

263
00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.760
From all over America
they come to California.

264
00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.160
Have you ever been
in a homeless shelter?

265
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:18.880
You get robbed,
beaten up and stuff.

266
00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:23.800
Then you say: Guys,
I'd rather go under a bridge.

267
00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.160
My ten years in L.A. ...

268
00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.840
You need an apartment,
to get a job.

269
00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.840
Without work
you don't get an apartment.

270
00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:34.640
But Germany
is a welfare state.

271
00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.640
Without an apartment you don't even get
social welfare or Hartz 4.

272
00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.200
You're asked: Where do you live?
Really?

273
00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.280
I don't know my way around anymore.

274
00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:45.720
Because you live half a year
in Dubai? 2,5.

275
00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.040
And before that, ten years in America.

276
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:50.640
Let's say,
the woman separates,

277
00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.960
I get a drinking problem
and I'm homeless.

278
00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:57.000
How do I get back on my feet?
Stop drinking.

279
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.560
Buying Rolex and so ...
What do I do?

280
00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:01.600
First stop drinking.

281
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.480
In the meantime you are
also online your mischief.

282
00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.920
Most of the time, as I said,
about coal. We'll take a look.

283
00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:15.440
(laughs) I am so horny,
I could fuck the ball.

284
00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:18.560
If you want to know
how to use this ball

285
00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:22.120
earns 100 euros every fucking day,
then Swipe Up.

286
00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.080
* Groan *
* Laughter *

287
00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.840
I think..,
I had hallucinations.

288
00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.120
Director, can we
look at the MAZ again?

289
00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.600
* Groan *

290
00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.320
We can be glad
that there was no EM.

291
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.880
Otherwise you would have been constantly excited.
Yes.

292
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:44.160
Tell me,
how do you get the mood right?

293
00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.560
Are these drugs,
that are mixed? No.

294
00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.760
Aperol spritz coke, or what?
No, I'm an entertainer.

295
00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.080
I can do that at the touch of a button.
Oh, no drugs? No.

296
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.880
Not at all?
Do you need drugs for that?

297
00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:02.040
Maybe so! I do not want you
in distress ...

298
00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:06.240
It could be, the Capri Sun
is tilted. * Laughter *

299
00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:12.680
That was good. Then the apple juice ferments
and you get a funny idea. Yes, yes.

300
00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.200
Can we see the VTR again?
* (LAUGHING)

301
00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:18.600
* Groan *

302
00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:23.040
Well, that could be anything.
I wasn't there.

303
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.160
There. You have to read everything.

304
00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.600
In the horizontal trade
you have made the big money

305
00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.280
and ended up in jail.

306
00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:35.440
In 2003 you were convicted
for pimping, human trafficking,

307
00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:39.240
robbery extortion
and dangerous bodily injury.

308
00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.040
You were in custody for one year.

309
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.360
Is that part of the trade?

310
00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:45.400
I was in prison for 2.5 years. 2,5?

311
00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.760
Oh, not a year? No.

312
00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.440
What do you say to that?
Yes, that can happen,

313
00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:54.760
when you are successful
and have many enviers.

314
00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.120
They meant it badly? I was
innocent. Who meant evil?

315
00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.000
The public prosecutor's office, for example
I see.

316
00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.800
By the way, I feel like
like in jail.

317
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.000
Same table, same lamp.
"Tell the truth!"

318
00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:08.640
It's like being in prison.

319
00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.160
Could be that this is
is like an interrogation room.

320
00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:14.360
Yes, exactly. Very bad.

321
00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:18.000
I actually thought
it looks like "Wetten das?".

322
00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:19.680
* Laughter *

323
00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.280
Did the judge have a bad day
a bad day when he put you in jail?

324
00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:29.000
I can not judge.
It must have been a Monday. True!

325
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.800
You get up on Mondays ... Not in the mood.

326
00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:34.960
Friday is even worse.
Everyone wants to go home.

327
00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.320
Always saying bad things.
Typical German.

328
00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:41.800
There's not so much good with you.
There is.

329
00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.960
You know? We did our research.

330
00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:48.280
There is probably
also a German.

331
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.720
Not that it means we invite you
and say only bad things:

332
00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:58.640
Say in camera 3
a good thing.

333
00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:00.360
I have ...

334
00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200
Watch. Yeah, I know.
* (LAUGHING)

335
00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:06.960
250,000. Good man.
* Applause * He has a watch.

336
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.800
Wait, I'm looking for the date.

337
00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.760
Five days ago I donated 50,000
I donated $50,000 to AIDS Relief.

338
00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.520
That's good. Yes.
* (applause)

339
00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.160
How did that feel?
I do this every year.

340
00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:26.640
That is also good. Thank you.
Did you bring the receipt?

341
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.920
* I...
Anyone can say that.

342
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.240
No, it's good. All right.

343
00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:37.480
But that does not make you
a very good person. * Laughter *

344
00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.440
If I'm a good guy for you,
that's good enough for me.

345
00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.160
I don't really know you.
True.

346
00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:45.160
I see you today for the first time.

347
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.880
I you too, so live.
I you at all.

348
00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.200
Please? I you at all.

349
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.680
No, I saw you beat up a young
I saw you beat up a young politician.

350
00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.840
Oh, Phipsi?
I don't know his name.

351
00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.080
Phipsi. Who spoke in the Bundestag.
Yes, eleven years old and with the CDU.

352
00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:04.320
* Laughter *

353
00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.200
* Applause *

354
00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.840
You once said:
"I like women just as much

355
00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.280
like a roast pork
with dumplings."

356
00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.560
Are women like good food for you?
Yes, of course.

357
00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.680
Why roast pork with dumplings?
Because this is my favorite dish.

358
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.400
My favorite food, in German.
Yes. Yes.

359
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.520
I like it very much.
And women too.

360
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.200
A comparison with roast pork
and dumplings? This is my top food.

361
00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:37.960
When you say to a woman:

362
00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:41.440
"You look
like roast pork with dumplings",

363
00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:45.640
the woman says:
"He is Prince, I forgive him."

364
00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:48.120
Yes. I think all women are great.

365
00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:52.960
A German study
from 2001 found:

366
00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.440
70% of the prostitutes
had experienced physical assault,

367
00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:01.000
68% had been raped,
most by johns.

368
00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.600
Are you itching?
I don't think that's true.

369
00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:07.440
This is a study.
Who made it?

370
00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.920
The source is: "Prevalence
of traumatic experiences,

371
00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:15.280
post-traumatic stress disorder
and dissociation in prostitutes.

372
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.800
An Exploratory Study."
Hamburg 2001.

373
00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.960
They surveyed all the prostitutes in
Germany? Here it is.

374
00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.400
Or those,
who have turned to them?

375
00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.400
70 % ... Of prostitutes
in Germany? Exactly.

376
00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:33.200
400,000 women? What do you say to that?
That can't be right.

377
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.840
Because you don't want to?
No, it can't be true.

378
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.840
Then yes ...
Shall we read through everything now?

379
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.240
78% Women are 8 out of 10.

380
00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:46.920
70%, how many times do I have to
repeat it? So 7 out of 10.

381
00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:50.560
I know a few hundred,
not one of them was raped.

382
00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:55.560
No prostitute in Germany
or worldwide has been raped?

383
00:21:55.720 --> 00:22:00.440
No, from those I know.
In the emergency room of the Charite, for example.

384
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.760
I did a podcast three months ago
podcast with one of my employees.

385
00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:08.680
How many have been raped,
who are not prostitutes?

386
00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:12.360
Others are also raped,
but you can't say

387
00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:17.040
no prostitute in Germany
has ever been raped.

388
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:20.400
I don't want to say that. But what
does that have to do with the job?

389
00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:24.120
Prostitution:
A drunken john walks in,

390
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.560
Rape...
She has security after all.

391
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.680
Please? At least in my houses.

392
00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.200
How many prostitutes do you know?
One?

393
00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:34.160
I have already had
over 4,000 have worked for me. Yes.

394
00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.760
And there has never been
a rape? No.

395
00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.680
Perhaps
to a rape attempt.

396
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.840
But they all have security.

397
00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:47.040
4.000 prostitutes
have 4,000 bodyguards?

398
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.680
No, I have, for example, in Frankfurt
a house with 65 pieces.

399
00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:53.520
They have two bodyguards.
* (murmuring)

400
00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.760
Piece ... Do you notice? It splashes
outside against the window pane.

401
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.920
* Laughter *

402
00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.200
You live in a dream world, don't you?
No, you might.

403
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.360
"7 out of 10 prostitutes
have been raped",

404
00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.640
is simply not true. Basta.

405
00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.480
You're going to put it that way? I know that.
They have no idea.

406
00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:19.880
The women of the study? A center
for traumatic experiences.

407
00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:23.320
Then come
100 prostitutes to them,

408
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.440
who have traumatic experiences
and talk about it.

409
00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:30.120
The 90,000 others who have not
traumatic experiences,

410
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:31.760
do not get there at all.

411
00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:35.000
With such a study you can wipe
wipe your ass with it.

412
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.720
I'll leave it at that,
we're going around in circles.

413
00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:41.640
It's like kindergarten:
I say yes, you say no.

414
00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.200
Afterwards we hit each other
with the shovel.

415
00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:45.920
* Laughter *

416
00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:47.920
What do I need as a puff daddy,

417
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:50.520
except that I look
a prison uniform suits me?

418
00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:58.600
It's very different today.
I haven't done that since 2005.

419
00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.520
Ask someone else.

420
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.840
Fresh out of jail, you sought
more and more the public.

421
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.600
2004, or what?
No, I was adopted in 2005.

422
00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.640
And ... "Here I am,

423
00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:14.280
Brothel owner and criminal.
Here we go!"

424
00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.080
2005 I was adopted,
the public came automatically.

425
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:22.840
Would you have friends without money?
I assume so.

426
00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.360
But I can not determine it,
because I always have money.

427
00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.600
If you have no more money,
which I don't wish on you...

428
00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:34.560
You should always have money,
so that you can buy watches.

429
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:36.600
You're out of dough,

430
00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:41.240
at four in the morning:
great tragedy in the house of Anhalt.

431
00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.960
Then do you have someone
you can call?

432
00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.120
My greatest treasure is not
my money, but my friends.

433
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:52.200
I have had five forever
and will always have them.

434
00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:57.040
They like you the way you are because
you have a great character?

435
00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.400
They criticize me too. What?

436
00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.440
I let them tell me
I also let them tell me something.

437
00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:06.640
Will they get their faces kicked in?
They are my friends. I see.

438
00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:09.360
On the face
and "We're friends, after all!"

439
00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.760
I don't punch anyone in the face.

440
00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:16.360
Is there anyone in your family
who says: With this show-off,

441
00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.520
brothel operators and criminals
do I want nothing to do with? No.

442
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.240
Because they don't dare?
No, I am not aware of anything.

443
00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:29.320
We haven't talked about
talked about cars for a long time.

444
00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.440
Cars bring you not only luck,
but also bad luck.

445
00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.520
In camera three, tell us what you were convicted of last time.
you were convicted of last time.

446
00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:38.480
Can you repeat that?

447
00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:42.200
We haven't talked about
about cars for a long time. * Laughter *

448
00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:46.720
Cars bring you not only luck,
but also bad luck.

449
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.680
In camera three, tell us what you were convicted of last time.
last time you were convicted.

450
00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:54.040
Where is camera three? Never mind.
* (LAUGHING)

451
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.520
I am ...
This will be pushed to you.

452
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.880
I was sentenced last time,
the third time,

453
00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:06.080
for tax evasion, because I
have deducted a company vehicle,

454
00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.360
as everyone does in Germany.

455
00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:12.680
We have something prepared.
I love to see you in court.

456
00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.480
(laughs) Good.

457
00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:18.200
Marcus Prinz von Anhalt,
the Pforzheim brothel operator,

458
00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.400
was today granted by the Regional Court of Augsburg

459
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.280
sentenced to three years in prison.

460
00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.720
At the pronouncement of the verdict in Augsburg
came Marcus Prince of Anhalt

461
00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.200
with one of his
many luxury limousines,

462
00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.640
because he had deducted some of them
had deducted from the tax.

463
00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:38.200
Three years in prison for the 49-year-old,
who believes he is innocent.

464
00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:40.440
He had the luxury cars on business

465
00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:43.200
for image cultivation
as a show-off prince.

466
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.560
Marcus Prince of Anhalt
wants an acquittal

467
00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:50.160
and has therefore already appealed to the
Federal Constitutional Court.

468
00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:55.320
Did the Federal Constitutional Court
did anyone answer? It is still running.

469
00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:58.320
It can take up to 10 years.
10 years.

470
00:26:58.480 --> 00:27:03.240
It can take up to 10 years.
10 years in prison? Until you get there.

471
00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.160
They are a bit overwhelmed.
Are they lame?

472
00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:10.480
Or overwhelmed.
With you it is actually true:

473
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:14.200
Once a criminal, always a criminal.
I am not a criminal.

474
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.400
The judges
had a bad day?

475
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.440
I have a company
with 49 million euros in sales,

476
00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:25.160
leased a Maybach
for 8,000 euros a month

477
00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:28.760
and dropped him off.
8,000 euros a month? Yes.

478
00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:31.600
But I have
eight Rolls-Royces at home. Yes.

479
00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:34.960
There is this law ...
Do you also have garages for it?

480
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:38.200
Not that they're out in the rain.
Shall I show them to you?

481
00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.000
No, I believe you. You will have
have money for garages! Yes.

482
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.600
That would be something: Having cars,
but no money for garages.

483
00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:50.200
I am the only one in Germany
who has ever been convicted,

484
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:53.920
because he has a company car
is tax-deductible.

485
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.800
There is actually no such thing.

486
00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:59.560
Yes. I don't find that
not even that interesting.

487
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.280
* Laughter *

488
00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.640
Many celebrities have been
tax evasion convictions.

489
00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:08.880
Unfortunately they do not come
in my show, only you.

490
00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.200
Why? Because they are ashamed?
Probably.

491
00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.800
I have no problem.

492
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:19.240
(sighs) All right, Prince Carnival.
* Wrong name.

493
00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:21.920
That's it.
Come on, let's go out again.

494
00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.640
* Applause *

495
00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:33.160
I have a sign.

496
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.960
* Applause *

497
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:40.680
So, that was it.

498
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.800
Prince of Ascania
was with us today.

499
00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.200
But with the authorities
everything is shipshape, isn't it? Yes, yes.

500
00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.800
Do you come out freely
or are there people standing outside,

501
00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.160
they take you right away?
No, I'm good. Okay.

502
00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.640
Anything else you want to say
in your defense? No.

503
00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.520
I will refrain from the last word.

504
00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.840
We will then synchronize you
with some mess.

505
00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.960
That was "Chez Krömer".
Take care, neighbors. Bye!

506
00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:08.880
* Music *

507
00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:11.200
