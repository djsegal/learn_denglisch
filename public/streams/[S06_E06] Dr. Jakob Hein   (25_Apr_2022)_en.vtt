00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.080
.

00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.000
(Charles Aznavour)
# You are the one for me, for me

3
00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.160
# For me, formidable

4
00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.720
# You are my love
Very, very, very veritable

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.280
(Berlin dialect) Let's see what
the cat has put in front of the door.

6
00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.880
Doctor Jakob Hein,
50 years old,

7
00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.200
Physician,
Child and adolescent psychiatrist,

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.000
Specialist in psychiatry
and psychotherapy

9
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.640
as well as writers.

10
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.400
Doctor?
Mr. Krömer?

11
00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.160
I can't hear you.
Mr. Krömer, can you hear me?

12
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.400
Yes, I hear you.
Hello?

13
00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.080
Have I listed all your professions
correctly?

14
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.800
Yes, yes you did.
Yes, you definitely have.

15
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.320
Screenwriter would also be nice,
then there will be more orders.

16
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.240
Very important information.

17
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.200
With me also the fewest know,
that I come from dance. - Yes.

18
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.520
I'm coming in now,
You know how it is.

19
00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.800
It stings for a moment, hurts for
hurts for 30 minutes and then it stops.

20
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.920
Then I do one day
no sports. Is that it?

21
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.120
So.

22
00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.640
Doctor.
Mr. Krömer.

23
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.400
I am very happy about that.

24
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.720
We are tested, after all.
Yeah, hey.

25
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.920
Welcome, then we hug,
we are tested.

26
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.600
Hello.
Na.

27
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.160
Finally someone,
who has a high school diploma,

28
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.840
with a high school diploma and a degree.
And doctorate.

29
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.520
We only have idiots here.
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.400
I am curious ...
What am I invited to be?

31
00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.200
Shit, now I ...
What do you have?

32
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.600
I forgot the questions.

33
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.440
A shit,
I don't have the suitcase with me.

34
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.000
There.
Do you have it now?

35
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.120
Jakob Hein, that's where the name is.

36
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.560
Is always good,
because I forget that.

37
00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.640
So, yes, drink?
Yes, with pleasure.

38
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.720
What?
Water with pleasure.

39
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.880
We have this,
we had to paint this.

40
00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.800
Okay.

41
00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.120
Cheers.

42
00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.120
What is the difference between
psychiatry and psychologists?

43
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.320
Ah yes ...
Psychiatrist, psychologist?

44
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.840
One has studied medicine and
the other studied psychology

45
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.040
- two different courses of study.

46
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.920
One ends up in practice
mostly together again.

47
00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.000
For example, I studied medicine

48
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.840
and my psychological
colleagues all psychology.

49
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.880
To make it a little more difficult:

50
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.080
Some psychotherapists have
have not even studied psychology,

51
00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.760
but other things and
are now psychotherapists.

52
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.200
All good?
We are.

53
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.320
So, now explain psychiatry.

54
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.080
I had, I want to tell briefly,
I was afraid of psychiatry,

55
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.400
because I always thought ...
Even though we've known each other for so long?

56
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.320
You know a psychiatrist.

57
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.480
How long have we known each other?
25 years.

58
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.120
And no one knows from where.

59
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.240
I wanted to intersperse
- just occurred to me -

60
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.000
that you can also privately
can walk on water.

61
00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.320
Sometimes I was amazed,
when we were at the lake,

62
00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.160
that you just start running.

63
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.320
I was always very happy.

64
00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.120
I sent Jakob a text message:

65
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.760
"You can give me
some praise on the air."

66
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:28.040
But not like that, it's a bit clumsy.
Too fast, too soon.

67
00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.280
Doctor, ... Jacob ...

68
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.400
What do I do when I've been in showbiz for 30 years
in showbiz and always sweating?

69
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.960
Sweating it out for the next 30 years,
that's not going to happen anymore.

70
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.920
Is this a medical condition?
Uh.

71
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.400
That we have
that we have a technical term.

72
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:48.200
Oh, hyperhidrosis exists,
excessive sweating.

73
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:50.320
Hyperhidrosis?
Hyperhidrosis.

74
00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.520
Hydro you know, water,
and too much water.

75
00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.120
Ingrid, write down,
Hyperhidrosis.

76
00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440
It can be treated with Botox,
but that costly.

77
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.520
So you go to the region where the
sweat comes from and inject Botox.

78
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.360
That would be everywhere.
Then you'll probably take a bath.

79
00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.040
I would have to have all over my body ...
600 syringes with Botox.

80
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.320
Then everything would be smooth.
It comes ...

81
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.440
The legs would be smooth, the belly.

82
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.120
Well, the belly ...

83
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.360
So, no, psychiatry,
my fear was...

84
00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.560
The reason I ask is that many people
are afraid of psychiatry.

85
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.840
I was still thinking about the pictures
"One flew over the cuckoo's nest".

86
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.080
You are treated with electric shocks
treated, locked up,

87
00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.800
put under medication,
sedated.

88
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.200
Comparable to prison.
Complicated answer.

89
00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.760
There was such a psychiatry for a long time.

90
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.120
Especially in West Germany, there was
until the beginning of the 1980s.

91
00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.360
There were so 70-person rooms
with a division into four:

92
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.560
quiet women, restless women,
quiet men, restless men.

93
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.000
Did you get
a mental illness,

94
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.920
you were driven there, somewhere
on the mountain or in the forest.

95
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.880
Then you just ended up
in one of those 70-man rooms.

96
00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.920
If one was not yet mentally ill,
you became one at the latest,

97
00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.440
when you were locked in a room like this
locked in a room like this

98
00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.120
over several months.

99
00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.400
In this respect, the fear is justified
from this past.

100
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.640
But today that is no longer the case.

101
00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.760
We have, we try our ...
But why is everyone still afraid?

102
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.560
Why did my grandma always say:
- Hospital, not psychiatry -

103
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.080
"I'm not going to the hospital,
You just come out dead."

104
00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.680
Or: "Psychiatry
is only for sick people."

105
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.800
I'm sure that's where the fear comes from,

106
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.520
that this is always
repeated on television.

107
00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.640
"One flew over the cuckoo's nest"
everyone tells me.

108
00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.800
Interesting that everyone quotes this film
even though it was made 50 years ago.

109
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.440
If you offer on television
e.g. fabrics:

110
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.760
"I'd like to tell stuff
tell from psychiatry",

111
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.000
they ask: "Why is
no straitjacket on page 3?"

112
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.800
True, straitjacket and why
no paper hat, the hand on the heart.

113
00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.440
Napoleon, exactly.

114
00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.360
Or plays table tennis, smokes
and then sleeps with his doctor.

115
00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.760
Then they say, "Because
psychiatry doesn't look like that."

116
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:13.560
And they: "But we can't expect
can't expect that of our viewers.

117
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:17.600
At least one injection against the
against the patient's will must be,

118
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:20.960
otherwise no one knows
that we are in the psychiatric ward."

119
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.320
I sometimes got calls
for television productions:

120
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:30.160
"We wanted to know where you get your
Proper straitjackets from?"

121
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.000
I said:
"We don't have straitjackets."

122
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.680
And he said, "That's for ARD,
you can really tell us."

123
00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.360
"I'm telling you, we don't
really no straitjackets."

124
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.000
Total disappointment.

125
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:46.800
I thought at the first birth,
you're behind a glass like that

126
00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:49.720
and then the nurse points:
"This is your child."

127
00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.240
I was overwhelmed,
it wasn't there at all.

128
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.280
They don't exist anymore.
No, you have to be in it.

129
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.600
Does this have to do with the Nazi era,
this fear of psychiatry?

130
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.960
It has to do with the way
psychiatry was over 60-70 years.

131
00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:08.800
It came so far,
that the German Bundestag in 1974

132
00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.400
established a commission of inquiry
was set up.

133
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.360
He established a commission,

134
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:16.880
which deals with the conditions
in psychiatry.

135
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:19.320
The laid down three years later,

136
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.080
that the conditions
there are untenable.

137
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.440
The conditions were horrific
and that is what it has most to do with.

138
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:33.280
If you didn't have the means
you didn't have private insurance,

139
00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.200
then the car drove
up there with you on the mountain

140
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.120
and you were gone for three years.

141
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.320
No one expected more ...
Forced incarceration?

142
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.520
Yes, well,
that was all so on the border.

143
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:51.880
The wind of freedom
did not blow up there.

144
00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.520
That was clear, you'll be there.

145
00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:58.320
If I had come there
and after three months would have said:

146
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.720
"We have to think about
how to discharge the patient",

147
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.120
they would have said: "Mr. Hein,
he's only been here three months.

148
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.160
We can consider in 2 years,

149
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.480
whether we will be able to use the from the restless
men ... to the quiet ...

150
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.640
Then it's close.
But they decide that?

151
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.480
When I am in a clinic,
the doctor must already say ...

152
00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:19.800
The conditions were untenable.

153
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.320
Today they are
not like that at all anymore.

154
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.960
We have few forced admissions.

155
00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:28.560
But there are?
There are judicial decisions.

156
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.160
When do you say as a psychiatrist:

157
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.160
"You can't do that,
He has to go to a psychiatric ward."

158
00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:37.760
I never say that,
that's what the judge or magistrate says.

159
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.080
This is,
when a patient recognizably

160
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.680
due to
of a psychiatric crisis,

161
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.280
acutely endangers himself
or others acutely endangered.

162
00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:49.800
Then it will be for 24 hours,
for 72 hours,

163
00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.480
by court order
housed

164
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.800
There are very strict rules.

165
00:08:55.960 --> 00:09:00.040
He must be constantly monitored
in the nursing sense,

166
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.720
non-police.

167
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:05.320
There is all the time
a caregiver with that person,

168
00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:07.280
to always be able to help her.

169
00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.800
Fortunately, this is
totally on the retreat.

170
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.480
But word doesn't get around,
when the media images

171
00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.000
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"
can be reproduced.

172
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:22.120
Because they reproduce themselves, they must
they have to be reproduced again.

173
00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.880
I have just seen
watched a movie again.

174
00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.040
I wrote with colleagues
in doctoral theses

175
00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.680
about the portrayal
of the mentally ill in "Tatort.

176
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.520
There were 200 mentally ill people,
three of them only in treatment

177
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:37.480
and one of them successfully.

178
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.240
It was all horror.

179
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.320
That will burn itself in.

180
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.080
According to the DAK, most
cases of illness at the workplace

181
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.720
psychologically conditioned.

182
00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.200
Have we all become crazier?

183
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.880
Why is that?

184
00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.120
Abolish work?
What do we do about it?

185
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.160
There was this wave where you had to be
for the workplace.

186
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.280
I.e., to be ready
to move to another city.

187
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.200
There you are alone,
has a smaller network,

188
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.120
what catches you,
when things are going badly for you.

189
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:11.760
A network that doesn't say, "Listen
Listen, Alex, go on sick leave.

190
00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:13.520
Take yourself out, drive away."

191
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.800
Did you just call me Alex?
No, it was an example.

192
00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.240
The patient's name is Alex?!
An example of a patient.

193
00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:22.720
My name is Kurt Krömer.
Yes, absolutely clear.

194
00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.840
Must be clear to you after 25 years of friendship
must be clear to you. - I have remembered that.

195
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.240
Like your music teacher
from the 9th grade.

196
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.040
Please?
Your music teacher ...

197
00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.520
His name was Mr. Wernitz.
Who was Mr. Krömer?

198
00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:36.320
The German teacher. - I see.
Are we friends?

199
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.520
I thought...
Where have you been in 25 years?

200
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.960
The chairman of the Charite board
is called Krömer. - Yeah, right.

201
00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.840
My father,
God rest his soul.

202
00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.040
Shit, now it's going to
really shit. - Funky.

203
00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:50.440
Where were we?
You said Alex. - I see.

204
00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.120
You're wrapping it up right now.

205
00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:55.760
So this network would have said:
"Take yourself out."

206
00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:58.440
These networks
have become thinner.

207
00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.400
Work efficiency
increases everywhere.

208
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:06.680
Thanks to great people
like Torsten Sträter, Lady Gaga

209
00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:08.480
or Nora Tschirner

210
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.200
mental illness is
also destigmatized.

211
00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:15.400
It's not so bad anymore
to be mentally ill.

212
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.480
But are we there yet?
Yes, we are.

213
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.000
I get
a lot of letters from people:

214
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.840
"I'd like to do it, too,
but my boss."

215
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.080
Or you are about to get a promotion
and the boss says:

216
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.920
"I don't take Krömer,
is a risk factor.

217
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:31.520
He has more to do,
if he is promoted,

218
00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.440
we'll put that one back a little bit."

219
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.440
Or the boss says:
"Stop spinning for once

220
00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.640
And don't be so hysterical."

221
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.440
It has become much better.

222
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.000
Of course, you still find,
if you dig, so stone age bosses.

223
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:47.240
But it has gotten much better.

224
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.760
When I need therapy
and I'm ready ...

225
00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:54.080
I need to get to the point
- to my example -

226
00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.840
"I have depression,
I'm looking for a clinic now."

227
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.560
On average I have to wait 3-9 months
for a therapy place.

228
00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:06.760
Why does it take so long? - The clinic
and therapy place are different.

229
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:09.560
One tries first,
to get a therapy.

230
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.440
How long does it take?
3-9 months - that is.

231
00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:16.960
The therapy place? - Yes,
a place with a psychotherapist.

232
00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:21.280
And clinic? - Clinic is when
you primarily go to the hospital,

233
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:25.760
because you are no longer in control of your
can no longer hold on to it,

234
00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.960
no longer feels safe enough,

235
00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.200
that once a week
to the psychotherapist ...

236
00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:33.640
How quickly can I get
the clinic place?

237
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:35.280
* (SIGHS)
Right now...

238
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:38.600
We're talking about cash patients.
I know.

239
00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.960
In my case, as a private patient,
it went very quickly. But cash register ...

240
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.920
We have the good system
of sectorization:

241
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:50.680
Each clinic is responsible for a specific
area in Germany.

242
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:53.800
And each zip code
is assigned a clinic.

243
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.800
I.e., it goes acutely no more,
there is a clinic,

244
00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.240
where you can say:
"I can't do it anymore.

245
00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.400
I have acute suicidal thoughts,
I need help."

246
00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:04.120
Then you will be admitted.

247
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:06.680
Do you want
elective treatment,

248
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.880
so you say, "I want to go to the clinic.

249
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:12.400
I need inpatient therapy
for a longer period of time.",

250
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.360
it is certainly also 6-9 months.

251
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:17.840
Why does it take so long?
Because there are too few places.

252
00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.800
There are enough therapists,

253
00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.240
but there are
too few places for patients.

254
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:26.640
They've been taken down, they're expensive.

255
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:30.040
And new admissions
for psychiatrists in private practice

256
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.880
and psychotherapists
there are too few.

257
00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:36.200
We have enough therapists
in Germany who ...

258
00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:39.240
There are several thousand
in the starting blocks,

259
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:41.200
who would do it immediately.

260
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:44.360
Why is that not possible?
there is a need for it?

261
00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:49.120
The individual therapists should
or want to live adequately from it.

262
00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.200
If you allow a few thousand
new therapists are allowed,

263
00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.600
is the concern that there is no longer
there is no longer enough money for it,

264
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.760
to be able to pay them
from this cash pot.

265
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.080
But that burns.
Yes.

266
00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.280
There are 100 houses on fire
and we say

267
00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.680
"We only have water
for two houses."

268
00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.880
Then it is because
no one wants to fetch new water.

269
00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.080
At the moment, the system is bursting
at the seams.

270
00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.240
We notice that
someone is in touch practically every day.

271
00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.920
I had the curious,

272
00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:24.120
that some patients
already bring patients with them.

273
00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.960
The patient says: "Thank you
again for the conversation.

274
00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:32.480
And by the way, a friend of mine
is urgently looking for a place in therapy.

275
00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.000
I would like to
enroll her with you."

276
00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.400
I say:
"This is bad right now."

277
00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.360
Then he says, "I'll pass.

278
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:43.040
I donate my appointments
or every other appointment." - Is that possible?

279
00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:45.960
It is yes
regularly looked at, calculated,

280
00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:48.720
how many therapy places
are needed.

281
00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.920
The health insurance companies
but then say ... "Uh, no."

282
00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:55.960
Exactly, this is calculated according to a
calculated according to a complicated key,

283
00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.160
where evil people are of the opinion
that it is so complicated,

284
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.640
that no one understands it and no one
no one can specifically question.

285
00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:08.240
It's so complicated.
I once saw an illustration of this.

286
00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.040
You get an instant headache
from this listing.

287
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:18.080
It is the case that actually officially
Berlin, for example, is oversupplied.

288
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.160
There are in Berlin
according to the official figures

289
00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.880
too many therapists.

290
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.320
But we don't notice anything about it.

291
00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.920
We have the feeling
we are too few.

292
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.440
The Chairman
of the Federal Committee, Josef Hecken,

293
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.280
said in 2013 in a meeting

294
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.400
of the Association
of the statutory health insurance funds,

295
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.360
not every citizen needs a psychotherapist
a psychotherapist for every citizen.

296
00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.920
A bottle of beer
sometimes does the trick.

297
00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.280
Such a saying in 1789, for which they chopped off
Marie-Antoinette's head for it.

298
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.720
She put it on cake.
Exactly.

299
00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.320
Would he say something like that for
people of other skin color,

300
00:15:56.480 --> 00:16:00.280
he would be immediately
removed from office.

301
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:03.360
It is unbearably stigmatizing.

302
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.400
But is the hedge
master of the situation?

303
00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:09.000
Maybe he means that
he twists himself a beer

304
00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:12.440
and then the problems
no longer seem so difficult.

305
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.200
I am a dry alcoholic.
What do I do?

306
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:19.280
Apple juice spritzer?
No, that is wrong and brazen.

307
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.080
But that's the boss,
one does not want,

308
00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:24.520
because the says:
"Don't be like that.

309
00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.840
Screw one in
on the weekend." - Exactly.

310
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.560
"Have a laugh" at depression ...
Watch a comedy, case of beer.

311
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:36.640
Exactly and always very important: sex.

312
00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:39.360
Sex is also supposed to be so helpful.

313
00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:43.240
"Laugh again",
and the other once again.

314
00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:48.120
So, we come to the next topic:
We are both fathers.

315
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:51.840
How do we explain to our children
that, in my case,

316
00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.280
I sit in front of n-tv all day long
and watch war coverage?

317
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.480
How to declare war to children?

318
00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.880
As honestly as you can.

319
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.080
One can say,
that you do not understand it yourself.

320
00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:09.520
That one speaks openly and says:
"I don't understand it myself.

321
00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.360
I also think it is
wrong and pointless.

322
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.760
We can be happy and grateful,

323
00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:17.240
that we
live in a safe country.

324
00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:20.440
But we must not close our eyes
from the dangers of the world

325
00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.080
not close.

326
00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.800
Just imagine,
you could declare war on children.

327
00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:29.120
That would be a great relief.

328
00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:31.800
Then I would say to the,
who can do that:

329
00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:35.280
"Will you please explain it to me too?
I don't understand it."

330
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:38.960
I always liked from Matthias
Claudius: "Alas, it is war

331
00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.800
and I desire
not to be to blame for it."

332
00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.440
It's just completely absurd.

333
00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:48.600
2 million Ukrainians are on the run right now
half of them children.

334
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.440
Probably 4,
when the program is broadcast.

335
00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:56.120
Horrible.
What does that do to the children?

336
00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.840
They can't get that
can't get it out of their heads, can they?

337
00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.040
I make no distinction
between people.

338
00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.840
It is terrible for children
and adults terrible.

339
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.040
Children have the advantage
that they are highly adaptive.

340
00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.360
The world is
not made for children,

341
00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:14.520
that's why everything is
terrible and processable.

342
00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:17.280
But adults,
the older they get,

343
00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:21.200
hold more to the area,
the homeland they come from.

344
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.960
Children have the chance to make this
become part of their lives.

345
00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.840
When the v.a. friendly faces
and people meet

346
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.680
and find good conditions here in
Germany or Poland,

347
00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.400
it does not have to be traumatic.

348
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.920
We have
children, too, of course,

349
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.280
who have experienced bad things.

350
00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:49.520
A 14-year-old boy who has lost his
two best friends

351
00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.800
at the missile impact.

352
00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:57.120
One cannot even imagine,

353
00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.360
that he will ever
in his life.

354
00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:03.600
When your practice door
the doorbell rings

355
00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.280
and Putin is standing there,
what would you do?

356
00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:09.800
Jesus.
I think that's unlikely.

357
00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.680
I think he lives in the bunker.

358
00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.000
I can't imagine
that he would come by.

359
00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:16.640
Yes ...

360
00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:21.440
He was officially labeled as a lunatic
as a remote diagnosis.

361
00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.760
Yes,
that is annoying nonsense.

362
00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:27.600
As a psychiatrist, you don't watch
you don't watch someone on TV.

363
00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.280
This is annoying nonsense,
because we consider ourselves

364
00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:32.960
expose like this.

365
00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:37.160
We are not people who make
diagnose via a television set.

366
00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:38.920
That's just horrible.

367
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.360
There will be no diagnosis
about Putin,

368
00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.400
because he will never do a 3-day
examination

369
00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.280
with a psychiatrist
and a psychologist,

370
00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:50.560
where he will honestly answer
about everything

371
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:54.000
and you can say at the end:
"Okay, he has so and so."

372
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:57.080
You have to see him as a politician,
as a thinking person

373
00:19:57.240 --> 00:20:00.400
take as seriously as possible
and this has not been done.

374
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:03.680
He always gave
these nationalistic speeches.

375
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:06.520
There it was always:
"Yes, it's so cultural."

376
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:10.200
So did this speech
2001 in the Bundestag ...

377
00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.400
Since then he has
definitely changed. - Yes.

378
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.800
There is no doubt about that.
Was he like that back then? - Nope.

379
00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.840
Or did he make it up
and lied back then?

380
00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.760
Since then, it has changed.

381
00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.200
This pointed pyramid of power
in Russia

382
00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.600
has been since Ivan the Terrible
unfortunately not different.

383
00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.040
I think that changes you a lot,

384
00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:34.200
when you have the largest country in the world
completely under control

385
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.040
and everyone just says how great
and right you do everything.

386
00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.160
I think,
it changes you unpleasantly.

387
00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:43.840
But if tomorrow
were to show up at my door...

388
00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.840
I would ...

389
00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.320
I really don't know.

390
00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.960
It's a mean question because ...

391
00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.240
I don't know.

392
00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:57.000
You could say,
give me 9 months.

393
00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.720
To him?

394
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.880
But he must be
private insurance. - Yes, I see.

395
00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.680
Let's talk about toxic
Masculinity. - Yes.

396
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.840
The two of us here
paint our fingernails.

397
00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
We are not Chuck Norris
and Charles Bronson in conversation.

398
00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.000
Used to be. - Yes.

399
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:22.040
What do you think about
when men fight their fights

400
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.000
with fists?
Totally crap.

401
00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:27.480
When they fight.
I find it poop and survives.

402
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.960
This has to do with the fact that
would always lose such fights.

403
00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.600
I find it problematic.
I find it terrible.

404
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:39.280
I have a VTR of two men,
which we look at.

405
00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.760
After that I would
like to talk about it.

406
00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.720
* Applause and whistles *

407
00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.760
How can this be explained?

408
00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:03.560
There is a man lying on the ground and
the other one punches him in the kidneys.

409
00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.320
I tell you, this is
for my literary career

410
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.480
the worst thing I can do,
is to come here.

411
00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:15.520
I am not a serious
serious writer,

412
00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:19.120
because I'm going to a comedian.
You're not going to a comedian.

413
00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:22.640
Yes, you are the comedian,
who always wears colorful ties.

414
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.040
I don't do that anymore.
It doesn't matter.

415
00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:26.720
That sticks.
Yes.

416
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:30.120
For 10 years I do not wear
colorful clothes anymore,

417
00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:32.840
also have the hair,
so new toupee.

418
00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.360
And you wear glasses.
But it's still in the paper:

419
00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.960
"... with his
brightly colored suits,

420
00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:42.360
Alexander Bojcan,
who is, after all, playing an artificial character."

421
00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.680
And I'm a writer,
who has become such a comedian

422
00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.880
with his colorful shirts goes.

423
00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:53.200
So it is clear that you the books,
that I write

424
00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:55.320
cannot take seriously.

425
00:22:55.600 --> 00:23:00.240
Someone rolling on the floor,
you can't... - Horny ...

426
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.680
How long ago was that?
Ten years or so.

427
00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.120
Over 10 years, I think.
Even longer.

428
00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:07.400
How was the day
afterwards in practice?

429
00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:09.680
I was still at the Charite then.

430
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:14.280
Did people say, "I saw you on
I saw you on TV yesterday?"

431
00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:18.760
I drove home
from the recording.

432
00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.640
After all, people have ...

433
00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:25.800
One was carried out because he
fainted from laughter

434
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.880
and one has wet himself.

435
00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.680
I felt the same way, I
I would have liked to wet myself.

436
00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:35.080
I drove home with the feeling,

437
00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:43.760
that I stole
stole 1 billion.

438
00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.520
It's not okay
what happened.

439
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.680
But it was very cool
and it's kind of cool too.

440
00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:53.960
But it is also a little wrong
and let's see ...

441
00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.960
It has remained similar to this.

442
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.720
So exactly, there we have,
so the, how do you say?

443
00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:06.280
The experienced viewer
savvy viewer will find himself ...

444
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.960
Do you mind if I gender?
I don't gender that much.

445
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:11.600
You didn't.

446
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:14.240
I say: "spectators
and spectators".

447
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.880
I gender when it is important,
for example, with AfD voters.

448
00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.120
With so many lateral thinkers
you have to gender them. - True.

449
00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.840
That one then simply ...

450
00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.720
I can't get the pauses right,
this spectator.

451
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:31.720
How long should I put the pause?
But you can say fried egg?

452
00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:33.880
Fried egg.
That's how long the break is.

453
00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:38.080
You say mirror egg, not fried egg
Viewers_"fried egg"_Inside.

454
00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.800
No, spectators.
Spectator...In.

455
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:43.720
How long should the break be?
Spectators.

456
00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:47.840
I can say "spectator",
smoke one, come back: "_inside".

457
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.000
But do you gender in your books?
I pay attention to that by now.

458
00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.320
Yes? Is it okay like that?
You don't say:

459
00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:58.000
"I want a mirror..,
go out, have a smoke, "-egg".

460
00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.200
What does that have
to do with the fried egg?

461
00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:03.920
There is also a pause.
Am I falling into a psycho trap now?

462
00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:07.040
No, you say mirror egg.
There is such a pause.

463
00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:09.840
Spectators.
That's right, there we have it.

464
00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.520
AfD voters.

465
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.240
But idiots.
E.g., exactly.

466
00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.080
But it's okay if I say:
"spectators and viewers".

467
00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.480
or "bystanders".

468
00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.000
Although some of my
trans-patients do not feel

469
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.960
100% feel addressed.

470
00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:28.680
But they know
that you are thinking about them.

471
00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.360
The break is for trans?
Yes, that's right, the pause is everything.

472
00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:39.400
The pause means moving
away from all this nonsense.

473
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:43.200
In the "Süddeutsche" there was an
article: "Abolish the women",

474
00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.760
where it was about, let's stop
with this women are so and so.

475
00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.640
I'd like to add, "Yes,
And get rid of the men, too."

476
00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.840
Abolish all women and men.
Then we will have only animals, great.

477
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.680
We are people.
Animals are better friends.

478
00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.160
The people
are doing away with themselves.

479
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:07.440
I found out a year or so ago
that I am not a man either.

480
00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:11.240
I thought that someday I would become
a man. One who is so ...

481
00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.880
I think I will grow up
grow up. Do you? - Of course.

482
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.640
That I think, "Enough
stop this nonsense, behave yourself."

483
00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:22.120
Yes, you probably will, yes,
We'll see. At 50 then?

484
00:26:22.280 --> 00:26:24.080
I still have some time left.

485
00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:27.040
I keep my fingers crossed.
That's it. - Oh?!

486
00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.560
I still wanted to
about my new book ...

487
00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.480
What is it called?
Is now ...

488
00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.200
You are the only one
who is allowed to advertise.

489
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:37.000
No, that makes me uncomfortable.
"Hypochondriac.

490
00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:40.320
Nope, "the hypnotist."
"Hypochondriac" was the previous one.

491
00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:43.240
Why don't you say what it's called?
Now you've said it.

492
00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:46.160
You just advertised,
snotty.

493
00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:48.800
So, Doctor Jakob Hein.

494
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:55.120
Here it goes on
with Practice Health on the topic ...

495
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.600
Do you know?
Um, "Title... Title, The..."

496
00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.440
No, that's
"Perpetrator, Victim, Tatärä" or something.

497
00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.040
"COVID-19, Challenge
for the society

498
00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.920
Or Opportunity for All of Us."

00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:13.320
Be sure to stay tuned.

* Music: Charles Aznavour *

501
00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.120
* Conversation cannot be heard. *

502
00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:24.160
* Music: Charles Aznavour *

503
00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:31.120
# You are the one for me, for me

504
00:27:31.280 --> 00:27:33.440
# For me, formidable

505
00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.280
# You are my love,
very, very, very veritable

506
00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.680
# Et je voudrais pouvoir
un jour enfin te le dire

507
00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.320
# Te l'ecrire

508
00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.200
Are these free songs?
Yes.

509
00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:56.280
But isn't
Gilbert Becaud or something?

510
00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.960
Charles Aznavour.

511
00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:00.920
Oh and 70 years
these songs are already gone?

512
00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.600
I don't know.

513
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.440
Do we pay for the songs,
we play?

514
00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.560
So, we're going back in.

515
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.560
Are you ready yet?

516
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.240
That's it.
